# Geodesics: Transformation Paths Through Spectral Space

**Status**: ✓ COMPLETE (v1.0)

Geodesics define the valid routes archetypes can take when transforming between states. These are not arbitrary—they follow the "physics" of archetypal dynamics defined in `FUNDAMENTAL_LAWS.md`.

## Types of Geodesics

### 1. Axis Geodesics (Single-Axis Movement)
Movement along one spectral axis while others remain relatively stable.
- **Example**: Creator → Destroyer (along creation-destruction axis)

### 2. Diagonal Geodesics (Multi-Axis Coordinated Movement)
Simultaneous movement on multiple axes in a coherent pattern.
- **Example**: Maiden → Crone (ascent-descent + stasis-transformation)

### 3. Spiral Geodesics (Developmental)
Progressive movement through stages, often cycling back at higher levels.
- **Example**: Hero's Journey (departure → initiation → return at transformed coordinates)

### 4. Shadow Descent/Integration
Movement toward and back from shadow manifestation.
- **Example**: Sovereign → Tyrant → Integrated Sovereign

## Constraints

1. **Conservation**: Total archetypal energy conserved during transformation
2. **Continuity**: No "teleportation"—must pass through intermediate states
3. **Activation Energy**: Some transitions require threshold conditions
4. **Reversibility**: Some geodesics are reversible, others are one-way
