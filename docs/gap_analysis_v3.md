## Remaining Gaps

### High Priority

| Gap | Reason | Recommended Text |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| Coffin Texts | Bridge Pyramid Texts to Book of Dead | Faulkner translation (source fix needed) |
| Buddhist Pali Canon | Have Jataka/Dhammapada, need more | Vinaya, Sutta Nipata |
| Bundahishn | Zoroastrian creation/eschatology details | Sacred Books of East |
| More Mesopotamian | ETCSL has vast untapped content | Lugalbanda, Enmerkar cycles |

### Medium Priority

| Gap | Reason | Recommended Text |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| Thai/Javanese Ramayana | Shows epic transformation | Ramakien, Kakawin Ramayana |
| Jewish Midrash | Post-biblical Jewish mythology | Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer |
| Sufi texts | Islamic mystical tradition | Rumi's Masnavi |
| Hermetic Corpus | Late antique synthesis | Corpus Hermeticum |
| More Gnostic | Have some, incomplete | Nag Hammadi expansion |

### Low Priority (Future Phases)

| Gap | Reason | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Alchemical symbolism | Transformation archetype | Specialized |
| Medieval bestiaries | Symbolic animals | Secondary sources |
| Vision literature | Shamanic/mystical | Cross-cultural compilation |

## Coverage Scores (Final)

| Dimension | Score | Change |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Regional Coverage** | 90% | +15% |
| **Typological Coverage** | 90% | +10% |
| **Archetypal Saturation** | 85% | +10% |
| **Translation Plurality** | 65% | +15% |
| **Provenance Documentation** | 95% | +5% |

### Score Methodology

- **Regional**: % of major mythological regions with 2+ primary texts
- **Typological**: % of mythic functions (cosmogony, hero, etc.) with 3+ examples
- **Archetypal**: % of core archetypes with cross-cultural attestation
- **Translation Plurality**: % of major texts with 2+ translations
- **Provenance**: % of texts with documented source URLs

---

## Recommendations for Phase 3

### Structured Extraction Priorities

Once corpus is stable, extract:

1. **Named Entities**
   - Deities, heroes, places, sacred objects
   - Cross-text resolution (Ishtar = Inanna = Astarte)

2. **Motif Index Alignment**
   - Tag texts with Thompson Motif Index codes
   - Build custom archetypal tagging ontology

3. **Pattern Confidence Scoring**
   - Count independent attestations per pattern
   - Weight by geographic/temporal isolation
   - Flag potential diffusion vs. independent emergence

4. **Narrative Structure Analysis**
   - Map hero's journey stages across texts
   - Identify descent/return sequences
   - Track transformation triggers

### Integration with Mythopoetic OS

The extracted patterns feed into:
- **ACP (Archetypal Compression Protocol)**: Encode patterns as reusable primitives
- **Narrative Engine**: Generate stories from pattern combinations
- **Validation Layer**: Cross-check new narratives against attested patterns

---

## Conclusion

The Mythic Library has reached **critical mass** for Phase 3 work. With 132 texts across 32 traditions, we have sufficient coverage to:

1. **Validate** claims about "universal" patterns (we can now test across truly diverse, unconnected cultures)
2. **Extract** recurring motifs with statistical confidence
3. **Build** a pattern database for computational mythology

The remaining gaps are either:
- **Specialized** (Coffin Texts, Hermetic) - nice to have, not essential
- **Deep expansion** (more Mesopotamian, more Pali) - diminishing returns
- **Source issues** (texts exist but public domain access limited)

**Recommendation**: Proceed to Phase 3 (Structured Extraction) while opportunistically filling remaining gaps.

*Analysis complete. Library ready for pattern extraction phase.*
