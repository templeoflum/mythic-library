## Remaining Gaps

### High Priority

| Gap | Reason | Recommended Text |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| Coffin Texts | Bridge Pyramid Texts to Book of Dead | Faulkner translation (source fix needed) |
| Buddhist Pali Canon | Have Jataka/Dhammapada, need more | Vinaya, Sutta Nipata |
| Bundahishn | Zoroastrian creation/eschatology details | Sacred Books of East |
| More Mesopotamian | ETCSL has vast untapped content | Lugalbanda, Enmerkar cycles |

### Medium Priority

| Gap | Reason | Recommended Text |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| Thai/Javanese Ramayana | Shows epic transformation | Ramakien, Kakawin Ramayana |
| Jewish Midrash | Post-biblical Jewish mythology | Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer |
| Sufi texts | Islamic mystical tradition | Rumi's Masnavi |
| Hermetic Corpus | Late antique synthesis | Corpus Hermeticum |
| More Gnostic | Have some, incomplete | Nag Hammadi expansion |

### Low Priority (Future Phases)

| Gap | Reason | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Alchemical symbolism | Transformation archetype | Specialized |
| Medieval bestiaries | Symbolic animals | Secondary sources |
| Vision literature | Shamanic/mystical | Cross-cultural compilation |

- **Translation Plurality**: % of major texts with 2+ translations
- **Provenance**: % of texts with documented source URLs

## Recommendations for Phase 3

### Structured Extraction Priorities

Once corpus is stable, extract:

1. **Named Entities**
   - Deities, heroes, places, sacred objects
   - Cross-text resolution (Ishtar = Inanna = Astarte)

2. **Motif Index Alignment**
   - Tag texts with Thompson Motif Index codes
   - Build custom archetypal tagging ontology

3. **Pattern Confidence Scoring**
   - Count independent attestations per pattern
   - Weight by geographic/temporal isolation
   - Flag potential diffusion vs. independent emergence

4. **Narrative Structure Analysis**
   - Map hero's journey stages across texts
   - Identify descent/return sequences
   - Track transformation triggers

### Integration with Mythopoetic OS

The extracted patterns feed into:
- **ACP (Archetypal Context Protocol)**: Encode patterns as reusable primitives
- **Narrative Engine**: Generate stories from pattern combinations
- **Validation Layer**: Cross-check new narratives against attested patterns

## v2 Validation Findings (January 2026)

The v2 validation suite tested ACP cross-cultural structural equivalence using 6 falsifiable tests. Results revealed specific gaps where the ACP's geometry doesn't match its own claims or external data:

### ACP Relational Gaps

| Gap | Impact | Source |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **~50 POLAR_OPPOSITE pairs with axis diff <0.5** | Test 3 fails (56.6% vs 70% threshold) | Coordinates under-express declared axis polarity |
| **Only 4 SHADOW relationships** | Insufficient for geometric testing | ACP needs more SHADOW type declarations |
| **Only 31 EVOLUTION relationships** | Marginal sample size | ACP needs more EVOLUTION type declarations |
| **Thompson motif letter categories too broad** | Test 5 fails (0/9 axis alignments) | Need fine-grained motif-code-to-axis mappings |

### Corpus-Level Gaps Exposed by v2

| Gap | Impact | Recommended Action |
|-----|--------|-------------------|
| **97% of cross-tradition entity pairs share motifs** | Test 4 group test meaningless (binary split fails) | Need finer Jaccard thresholds or more diverse entity coverage |
| **Motif tagging too uniform** | All motif categories span all traditions equally | Need motif-code-level (A1, D1000) entity associations, not letter-level |
| **42 unmapped heroes** | 44% of mention mass unrepresented in ACP | Impacts cross-tradition motif bridging test sensitivity |

### Strengths Confirmed

- Entity extraction quality is high (0% error rate in 100-sample audit)
- CULTURAL_ECHO relationships are well-calibrated (d=1.18, fidelity r=-0.45)
- Primordial hierarchy creates meaningful spectral clustering (r=-0.21)
- 3-axis subset (order-chaos, creation-destruction, individual-collective) consistently outperforms 8D

## Conclusion

The Mythic Library has reached **critical mass** for Phase 3 work. With 132 texts across 32 traditions, we have sufficient coverage to:

1. **Validate** claims about "universal" patterns (we can now test across truly diverse, unconnected cultures)
2. **Extract** recurring motifs with statistical confidence
3. **Build** a pattern database for computational mythology

v2 validation demonstrates that the ACP is **partially self-consistent** (Tests 1-2 pass, Test 3 marginal) but **lacks external predictive validity** (Tests 4-5 fail). The main corpus-level bottleneck is motif granularity — Thompson letter categories are too broad for axis-level testing, and the high baseline motif sharing rate (97%) makes binary group comparisons ineffective.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 12 (targeted refinement) focusing on: polar axis recalibration, fine-grained motif-code-to-axis mappings, and Jaccard quantile redesign for the motif bridging test.
