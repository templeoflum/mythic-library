# Mythic Library Gap Analysis

## Purpose

This library serves as the **foundation layer** of the Mythopoetic OS. We're not just collecting texts - we're building a corpus that enables:

1. **Archetypal Pattern Extraction** (ACP layer) - Mapping recurring patterns across cultures
2. **Structural Validation** - Ensuring claims about "universal patterns" are actually cross-cultural
3. **Anti-Weaponization** - Full provenance prevents cherry-picking and decontextualization
4. **Participatory Meaning-Making** - Multiple translations/versions preserve interpretive tension

---

## Current State (January 2025)

**62 texts cataloged** across 23 traditions, **104 files downloaded** (~220 MB)

### Strengths
- Good coverage of "canonical" Western comparative mythology sources
- Multiple translations for major texts (Iliad, Odyssey, Beowulf)
- Strong African folk tale coverage (9 collections)
- Indian epic tradition well-represented

### Critical Gaps

| Gap Type | Impact on Mythopoetic OS |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **South American mythology** | Cannot validate "universal" patterns without Americas coverage |
| **Australian Aboriginal** | Oldest continuous culture - essential for deep pattern analysis |
| **Korean mythology** | Major East Asian tradition completely missing |
| **Slavic mythology** | European coverage skewed toward Germanic/Celtic |
| **Descent narratives** | Missing Inanna's Descent - THE archetypal descent |
| **Transformation myths** | Missing Ovid's Metamorphoses - comprehensive transformation catalog |

## Gap Analysis by Dimension

### 1. Regional Coverage

```
COMPLETE (3+ texts):
  ✅ Greek           ✅ Indian         ✅ African
  ✅ Norse           ✅ Celtic         ✅ European
  ✅ Mesopotamian    ✅ Egyptian

THIN (1-2 texts):
  ⚠️  Chinese        ⚠️  Japanese      ⚠️  Mesoamerican
  ⚠️  Persian        ⚠️  Polynesian    ⚠️  Arctic

MISSING:
  ❌ Korean          ❌ Slavic         ❌ South American
  ❌ Australian      ❌ Melanesian     ❌ Mongol/Siberian
```

### 2. Mythic Type Coverage

| Type | Status | Key Missing Texts |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Cosmogony (creation) | ⚠️ Thin | Inca creation, Dogon, Australian Dreamtime |
| Theogony (divine origin) | ✅ OK | Homeric Hymns would strengthen |
| Hero Journey | ✅ Good | Aeneid, Argonautica would expand |
| **Descent** | ❌ Critical gap | Inanna's Descent, Orpheus myths |
| Trickster | ✅ Good | Anansi, Coyote covered |
| Dying God | ⚠️ Thin | Osiris in Book of Dead, need Attis, Adonis |
| Metamorphosis | ❌ Missing | Ovid essential |
| Eschatology | ✅ OK | Ragnarok in Eddas |
| Sacred Marriage | ❌ Missing | Inanna and Dumuzi |

### 3. Archetypal Coverage

For the ACP layer to work, we need texts that clearly exemplify each archetype:

| Archetype | Current Coverage | Needed |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Hero | ✅ Excellent | Gilgamesh, Odysseus, Rama, Beowulf |
| Trickster | ✅ Good | Anansi, Loki (in Eddas) |
| Wise Elder | ⚠️ Implicit | Merlin, Gandalf are derivative |
| Great Mother | ⚠️ Thin | Demeter in Homeric Hymns |
| Sky Father | ✅ OK | Zeus, Odin, Indra |
| Threshold Guardian | ⚠️ Implicit | |
| Shadow | ⚠️ Thin | Seth, Grendel |
| Shapeshifter | ⚠️ Thin | Proteus, various |

## Priority Acquisition List

### Tier 1: CRITICAL (blocks core functionality)

These texts are essential for validating cross-cultural patterns:

1. **Inanna's Descent to the Underworld** (Mesopotamian)
   - Source: ETCSL, various translations
   - Why: THE descent archetype, pre-dates all others
   - Blocks: Descent pattern mapping

2. **Ovid's Metamorphoses** (Roman)
   - Source: Project Gutenberg, Perseus
   - Why: Comprehensive transformation catalog
   - Blocks: Metamorphosis pattern mapping

3. **Homeric Hymns** (Greek)
   - Source: Perseus, Sacred Texts
   - Why: Major Greek deity myths (Demeter, Apollo, Hermes)
   - Blocks: Theogony patterns, Great Mother archetype

4. **South American creation myths** (at least one)
   - Source: Various academic, may need to compile
   - Why: Cannot claim "universal" without Americas
   - Blocks: Global validation of patterns

5. **Australian Dreamtime narratives** (with proper provenance)
   - Source: Academic collections with indigenous input
   - Why: Oldest continuous mythic tradition
   - Blocks: Deep time pattern validation

### Tier 2: HIGH (significantly improves coverage)

6. **Aeneid** (Roman) - Roman foundation + katabasis
7. **Völsunga saga** (Norse) - Sigurd cycle, heroic death
8. **Korean foundation myths** - Dangun, Samguk Yusa
9. **Slavic Byliny** - Eastern European hero tradition
10. **Shan Hai Jing** (Chinese) - Mythical geography/beings

### Tier 3: EXPANSION (deepens existing coverage)

11. Argonautica (Greek)
12. Orphic Hymns (Greek mystery tradition)
13. Lebor Gabála Érenn (Irish mythological history)
14. Nihon Shoki (Japanese alternate chronicle)
15. Pyramid Texts / Coffin Texts (Egyptian deep time)

## Research Methodology

### For each gap:

1. **Identify available sources**
   - Internet Archive (primary)
   - Project Gutenberg
   - Sacred-texts.com
   - Perseus Digital Library
   - ETCSL (Sumerian)
   - Academic repositories

2. **Evaluate translations**
   - Date of translation (older = public domain)
   - Translator credentials
   - Completeness
   - Multiple translations if possible (preserves interpretive tension)

3. **Document provenance**
   - Original language/culture
   - Date of composition (if known)
   - Transmission history
   - Translation methodology
   - Known biases/limitations

4. **Tag for mythic types**
   - Primary type(s)
   - Archetypes present
   - Structural patterns
   - Cross-references to similar myths

---

## Anti-Weaponization Considerations

The Mythopoetic OS aims to prevent mythic weaponization. The library must:

1. **Preserve context** - Full texts, not excerpts
2. **Multiple versions** - Prevent "one true reading"
3. **Attribution** - Every claim traceable to source
4. **Acknowledge gaps** - We don't have Aboriginal stories told BY Aboriginal people in public domain
5. **Note colonial context** - Many early translations have colonial biases

### Problematic Sources to Handle Carefully

- Victorian-era translations often imposed Christian frameworks
- "Universal myth" claims (Campbell, Eliade) have Western biases
- Some indigenous texts were collected without consent
- Comparative mythology historically used to rank cultures

**We include these sources with provenance notes, not as "neutral truth."**

- [ ] Add Aeneid from Gutenberg

### Short-term (this month)
- [ ] Research South American myth sources

### Medium-term (next quarter)
- [ ] Build archetypal index
- [ ] Create cross-reference system between texts
- [ ] Develop "pattern confidence" scoring
- [ ] Document all provenance systematically

## Metrics for "Complete" Coverage

We'll never be "complete" but we can measure progress:

1. **Regional diversity**: At least 3 texts from each major world region
2. **Typological coverage**: At least 5 texts exemplifying each mythic type
3. **Archetypal saturation**: Each archetype clearly present in 3+ traditions
4. **Translation plurality**: Major texts have 2+ translations
5. **Provenance documentation**: 100% of texts have full sourcing

Current scores (estimated):
- Regional: 60% (missing 5 regions)
- Typological: 70% (descent and metamorphosis gaps)
- Archetypal: 65% (thin on Great Mother, Shadow)
- Translation plurality: 40% (most texts single translation)
- Provenance: 80% (curated_sources.json is good)
