I.

          Never poet
      From Musaeus down,
Crowned with rose, or myrtle-wreath, or laurel,
      Had of daintier hand
          Dearer trophy!
          Therefore (know it,
Castaly! and, Daphne's lover, quarrel!)
          I for crown
Flout the bay and wear thy pansy-band,
          Mistress Sophie.
