II.

No wind from out the solemn wells of night
  But hath its burden of strange messages,
  Tormenting for interpreter; nor less
             The wizard light
That steals from noon-stilled waters, woven in shade,
  Beckons somewhither, with cool fingers slim.
No dawn but hath some subtle word conveyed
  In rose ineffable at sunrise rim,
             Or charactery dim.
