I.

Faithful reports of them have reached me oft!
  Many their embassage to mortal court,
  By golden pomp, and breathless-heard consort
             Of music soft--
By fragrances accredited, and dreams.
  Many their speeding herald, whose light feet
Make pause at wayside brooks, and fords of streams,
  Leaving transfigured by an effluence fleet
             Those wayfarers they meet.
