Atlengtli,thefame ofthis sorcererspreadex-

Tamure, achiefwho dwelt atKawhia, heard with
others, reportsofthemagical powersofKiki,for
hisfame extended over thewholecountry. At
length Tamurethoughthewouldgoandcontend
intheartsofsorcery with Kiki, that itmightbe
seenwhich ofthemwasmost skilled inmagic ;and
hearrangedinhisownmind afortunate season for

they landed, anddrewuptheir canoe onthebeach,

Assoon astheyhad landed, theoldsorcerer
called outtothem thattheywerewelcome tohis
village,andinvited them tocomeuptoit;sothey

tocome and eatfood with him;butthefood
was allenchanted, and hisobjectinasking Ta-

old sorcerer, Kiki, kept waitingforTaraure to

Tamure now ordered hispeopletolaunch his

afterthey had leftthevillage,Kiki became un-
well;inthemeanwhile, Tamure and hispeople
werepaddling homewards inallhaste, and as
they passedavillage where there were agood
many peopleontheriver's bank, Tamurestopped,

Some time after Tamure'sparty had leftthe

This head bewitched allpersons whoapproached

Uponthatmount dwelt Puarata andTautohito

allperished,from itsmagical influence, somewhere
about theplacewhere thebeaten trackpassesover

Thedeaths ofsomany personscreated agreat
sensation inthecountry, and, atlast, thereportof
these thingsreached averypowerfulsorcerer named
Hakawau, who, confidinginhismagical arts, said
hewasresolved togoandseethismagic head, and

Having byhisspellsascertained this,heatonce

which hetravelled wasthatofAkau;and,confiding


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 281
inhisownenchantments, hewentfearlesslytotry
whether hisartsofsorcery would notprevailover
themagic head, andenable him todestroytheold
sorcerer Puarata.
Hetookwithhimonefiiend, andwentalong
thesea-coast towards theSacred Mount, andpassed
through Whanga-roa,and followed the sea-shore
toRangikahuandKuhawera, andcame outupon
thecoastagainatKaroroumanui, and arrived
atMaraetai;there was afortifiedvillage,the
peopleofwhich endeavoured todetain Hakawau
and hisfriend untiltheyrested themselves and
partookofalittle food;buthesaid,"Weatefood

remain atMaraetai, butwentstraightonuntil
theyreached Putataka, andtheycrossed theriver
there, andproceeded alongthebeach toRukuwai;
neither didthey stop there, butonthey went,
and atlastreached Waitara.
Whenthey gottoWaitara, thefriendwho ac-

said,"Now we shallperish here, Ifear;" but

Heretheysmelt thestench ofthecarcases ofthe

thestench wassobadthat itwasquite suffocating,
andtheybothnow said,"This isafearfulplace ;

waukeptonunceasingly workingathisenchant-

theSacred Mount. Here theysatdown and
rested,forthe firsttime sincetheyhadcommenced
theirjourney. Theyhadnotyetbeen seenbythe
watchmen ofthe fortress. Then Hakawau, with
hisincantations, sent forthmany genii,toattack


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 283
thespirits whokeptwatch over thefortress and
magic head ofPuarata. Some ofhisgood genii
were sentbyHakawau inadvance, whilst he
chargedothers tofollow atsome distance. The
incantations bythepowerofwhich thesegeniiwere
sentforthbyHakawau wasaWhangai. Thegenii
hesent infront were orderedimmediatelytobegin
the assault. Assoon asthespirits whoguarded
the fortress ofPuarata saw the others, theyall
issued outtoattack them;thegood genii then
feignedaretreat, the evil onesfollowing them,
andwhilstthey were thusengagedinthepur-
suit,some ofthethousands ofgood genii, who
had lastbeen sent forth byHakawau, stormed
thefortress now leftwithout defenders;when, the
evilspirits, whohadbeen ledawayinthepursuit,
tm-ned toprotectthefortress, theyfound thatthe
geniiofHakawau hadalready gotquiteclose toit,
andthegood geniiofHakawau without trouble
caught them one after theother, andthus allthe
spiritsoftheoldsorcerer Puarata wereutterly
destroyed.
When allthe evilspirits whohadbeensubject
totheoldsorcerer hadbeen thusdestroyed, Haka-
wauwalkedstraight uptowards the fortress of
thisfellow, inwhomspirits haddwelt asthick as

hadused inlikemanner tocanythem about. When
thewatchmen ofthefortress, totheirgreatsur-
prise,sawstrangers coming, Puarata hurried tohis
magic head, tocallupon it;hissupplication was
after thismanner—"
Strangers, come here !strangers
come here !Two strangers come !two strangers
come !"But itutteredonlyalowwailingsound;
forsince thegood geniiofHakawau haddestroyed
thespirits who served Puarata, theoldsorcerer
addressed invain hissupplicationstothemagic
head,itcould nolongerraise aloud itspowerful
voice asinformer times, bututteredonlylowmoans
and wails. Could ithave cried outwith aloud
voice, straightway Hakawau and hisfriend would
bothhaveperished ;forthus itwas,when armies
and travellers had inother timespassedthe for-
tress, Puarata addressedsupplicationstohismagic
head, andwhen itcried outwith amighty voice,
thestrangersallperishedastheyheard it.
Hakawau and hisfriend had, inthemeantime,
continued towalkstraighttothe fortress. When
theydrew nearit,Hakawau said tohisfriend,
"Yougodirectly alongthepaththat leadsby
thegatewayinto the fortress; asforme,Iwill
showmypowerover theoldsorcerer, byclimbing
rightover theparapet andpalisades:"andwhen
theyreached the defences oftheplace,Haka-

waubegantoclimb over thepalisades ofthe
gateway. When thepeopleoftheplacesawthis,
theyweremuchexasperated, anddesired him, in
anangry manner, topassunderneath thegateway,
alongthepathway which wascommon toall,and
nottodare toclimb overthegatewayofPuarata and
ofTautohito; butHakawau wentquietly onover
thegateway, withoutpayingtheleast attention to
theangiy words ofthosewhowerecalhngoutto
him,forhefeltquitesurethatthetwooldsorcerers
were not soskilful inmagicalarts ashewas;so
Hakawaupersistedingoingdirect toallthemost
holy placesofthefortress, where noperson whohad
notbeenmade sacredmightenter.
AfterHakawau and hisfriend hadbeen fora
short time inthefortress, andhadrested them-
selves alittle, thepeopleoftheplace begantocook

Foralongtime thevoices grewlouder andmore

the fairiesapproachedtolook atTeKanawa, who

kept peeping slilyover thelargeroots ofthetree

hard-hearted, wereangryatthis,andbroke the

France'slibrary.
Dr.Barney,incommon withmost othermodern writers
onthesubject, says,"theintervals ofthe close enhar-
monic tetrachord

appear wholly strangeandunmanageable," andhence it
hasbeen concluded thattheenharmonic wasimpossiblein
practice.
Dr.Burney, however, onedayreceived aletter from his
friend Dr. Paissell, regardingthe"state ofmusic inAra-
bia,and totheDoctor's utter astonishment, helearnt from
that letter thattheArabian scale ofmusic wasdivided into
quartertones;andthatanoctave, which, uponourkeyed
instruments isonlydivided into12semitones, intheAra-
bian scale contained 2A,forallofwJiichtheyhadparticxdar
denominations.''
This latter observation would seem totallyverywell
withwhat Mr.Lane*saysofthecanoon{y.a.vu))ofthe
present Arabs, which, hesays, has24treble notes.Only,
thatheadds, eachnotehasthreestringstoit,which(later,
asweshallsee)heaffirms tohavebeen thirdsoftones. If
so,thesystemisashade ofthechromatic;and ifMr.
Lane isright (andhegivesadrawingoftheinstrument).
Dr.Russell must err,orspeakofanother instrument. I
should beinclined togive preferencetoLane, because of
thegreat painshehastaken indescribingtheinstrument.

Mr.Vincent*givesamost scientificdescriptionofan
elaborate instrument made atParis, exhibited attheIn-
stitut, onwhich thequarter tones were mostcorrectly
illustrated, andobserves, that amuch less interval than
thequarter-tone, perhaps eightortentimes less, isdis-
cernible, asproved byaM.Delezenne,f 1827; andour
ownears attest thatuniversallyinthemodulations ofthe
voice oftheso-calledsavage tribes, andintherefined and
anomalously-studied Chinese, there areintervals which do
notcorrespondtoanynotes onourkeyed instruments, and
which toanuntrained earappear almost monotonous.
There isanother matter withwhichincidentally wehave
todo,namely,anapparentdifference ofopinion between
ancient authors themselves about theenharmonic. Plu-
tarch|saysthatAristoxenus(inabook notnowextant)
informs usthatOlympus wastheinventor ofanenhar-
monic, butofakindconsistingofascale inwhich certain
notes, the"lichaui" or"iudicatrices," were omitted, and
thatthe airs ofOlympuswere sosimple and beautiful,
that there wasnothinglikethem.

Mypoint is,toprovethat theancients didpossess and

than ours,andthat such, oranapproachtosuch, modula-
tion(though probablybutimperfect)isstill retained
among somepeople,and that theprinciplesonwhich the
Greeks founded their enharmonicgenus,still survive in

thatsometimes thesesongs maynotchangeintooneof

notbeable todecide. Onething, however, iscertain, that,
asAristoxenus tells us,noperfectearcould modulate
more than twodieses atatime(andthen there wasa
"saltus" orinterval oftwotones), and astheNew Zea-
landsongs frequentlyexhibit more than tivoclose intervals

melodies;and shall show astillnearerapproachtothe
systemoftherealGreek enharmonic, inaChinese air
which Iheard andnoted.
Afewremarks onthesystem itself, the intervals, and
thenotation.
SYSTEM.
First, thatanenharmonic modulation mightexist is
admittedbymany modern writers. Mr.Donkiu, forin-
stance, author oftheable article onAncient Music in
Dr.W.Smith's"DictionaryofGreek andRoman Anti-
quities," observes(underthetitleof"Music")ofthediffer-
entgeneralessfrequently named,*"that itwould be
wrongtoconcludehastilythattheothers would beimpos-
sible inpractice,ornecessarily unpleasing ;"andoftheen-
harmonic hesays,"but itisimpossibletoform ajudgment
ofitsmerits without amuchgreater knowledgeofthe
rules ofcompositionthanseems nowattainable."
Mr.LayTradescanthavingshown thedifferences of
interval oftheChinese instruments from theintervals
generallyinuse inEurope,adds—"Itwill therefore
very readily appear from therespective rules, that the
character ofthemusic, or, ifyou please,themood(he
should have said"genus"), must beverydifferent from
ourown, andthatnone ofourinstruments(heshould
have saidkeyedorbored)arecapableofdoing jus-
tice toanyairthat isplayedonthekin"(orscholar's
lute). Hesubjoins:"Inmytravels Isometimes tvrote

thoughItookmuchpainstolearn themaccurately,I

always foundtheyhad lostsomethingoftheirpeculiaritywhenplayed upon theviolin.
"Thereason ofthisdefect seems tohavebeen thatthe
intervals oftheIndian music didnotagi-eewiththose of
Europe."*
Mr. Tradescant might have added, that there will
always besome difference inanairplayedontheguitar
andontheviolin, thoughtheintervals used areesteemed
thesame;and, again, perhaps thelearned traveller did
nottake care todivide thescale ofhisviolin mathemati-
cally, likethat ofthekin, before hetried the eff'ect;he
mightalsonothave noted theright interval. Hecon-
cludes :"There is,however, aconnection between theChi-
neseand oldScotch music, sothatwhenanyhighly-ad-
mired airsofScotlandhappentofallwithin thecompass
ofthekin,theyseem athomewhenplayed uponthis in-
strument."
Mr.Lanesaysthe"canoon" oftheArabians hadtwenty-
four notes. Dr.Russell toBurney saysthattheArab scale
oftwenty-four notes wasequaltoone octave. ButMr.
Lane adds, that"themost remarkablepeculiarityinthe
Arabsystem ofmusic isthedivision oftones into tJiirds."
Hence, fromthesystemoithirds oftones, Ihaveheard the
Egyptian musiciansurge against theEuropean systems of
music thattheyaredeficient inthenumberofsounds.
Thesame remark wasmade tomebySelim A«ar, a
Nubian, whensinging someAmharicsongs:"Your instru-
ment"(piano),said he,"isverymuch outoftune, and
jumps verymuch."
Mr.Lane adds: "These small anddelicategradations of
soundgiveapeculiar softness totheperformances ofthe
Arabmusicians, which aregenerallyofaplaintive cha^

racter; buttheyare difficult todiscriminate with exact-
ness, and therefore seldom observed inthevocal and
instrumental music ofthosepersons whohave notmade a
regular studyoftheart."
HadMr.Lane beendescribingthecharacter and diffi-
culties oftheancient Greek enharmonic orchromatic, he
could nothave used other terms;theyarealmost the
words ofAristoxenus, Vitruvius, Plutarch, andother an-
cient writers onthesegenera;andyet,headds,"hetook
great delightinthemore refined kind ofmusic," and
found"themore hebecame habituated tothestylethe
more hewaspleasedwith it."Hecontinues :"Hewas
perfectlycharmed with theperformanceofsome female
singers,andthatthenatives aresofascinated astolavish
considerable sums onthem."

INTERVALS.

consecutive gamutofquarter-tones —no;wearetold dis-
tinctly byallauthors(except, perhaps, Salinas),thatthere
wasaquarter-tone,then anotherquarter-tone,then a

that Iwillnotvouch forthemathematical exactness :nei-
ther will Ipledge myself nottohave written achromatic
