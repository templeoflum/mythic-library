PREFACE.
Towards the close oftheyear1845 Iwas
suddenly andunexpectedly requu'ed bytheBritish
Government toadminister theaffairs ofNew Zea-
land,andshortly afterwards received theappoint-
ment ofGovernor-in-Chief ofthose Islands.
When Iarrived inthem, Ifound HerMajesty's
nativesubjects engagedinhostilities with the
Queen's troops, against whomtheyhaduptothat
timecontended with considerable success;somuch
discontent alsoprevailed generally amongstthe
nativepopulation, thatwhere disturbances hadnot
yettakenplace,there was toomuch reason to
apprehend theywould soon break out, asthey
shortly afterwardsdid, inseveralpartsofthe
Islands.
Isoonperceived that Icould neithersuccessfully
govern,norhopetoconciliate, anumerous and tur-
bulentpeople, withwhoselanguage, manners, cus-
toms, religion, andmodes ofthoughtIwasquite
unacquainted. Inorder toredress theirgrievances,

andapply remedies, which would neither wound
theirfeelings,normilitateagainsttheirprejudices,
itwasnecessarythat Ishould beablethoroughly
tounderstand theircomplaints ;andtowin their
confidence andregard,itwas alsorequisitethat
Ishould beable atalltimes, and inallplaces,
patientlytolisten tothe tales oftheirwrongsor
sufferings, and,even ifIcould not assist them, to
givethem akindreply, couched insuch terms as
should leave nodoubt ontheir minds that I
clearlyunderstood and felt forthem, andwas
reallywelldisposedtowards them.
Althoughfurnished with someveryable inter-
preters, whogavemeassistance ofthemostfriendly
nature, Isoon found that even with their aidI
could stillonlyvery imperfectly perform myduties.
Icould notatalltimes andinallplaceshavean
interpreter bymyside;andthence oftenwhenway-
laidbysome suitor, who had, perhaps,travelled
two orthree hundi'ed miles tolaybefore methe
taleofhisorhergrievances,Iwascompelledto
passonwithoutlistening, andtowitness withpain
anexpressionofsorrow andkeenly disappointed
hopecloud over features which themoment before
werebrightwithgladness,that theopportunityso
anxiouslylooked forhadatlengthbeen secured.
Again,Ifound thatanytaleofsorrow orsuffer-
ing,passing throughthemedium ofaninterpreter,

fellmuch morecoldlyonmy ear,thanwhat it
would have done hadtheperson mterested ad-
dressed the tale dh^ect tomyself; and inlike

tion ofathii-dperson, appearedtoleave avery
differentimpression uponthe suitor towhat it
would havehadcomingdirect from thelipsofthe
Governor ofthecountry. Moreover, thismode
ofcommunicationthroughathirdperson was so
cumbrous and slow, that, inorder tocompensate
forthe loss oftime thusoccasioned, itbecame
necessaryfortheinterpreterstocompress thesub-
stance oftherepresentations made tome,asalso
ofmyownrepUes,into thefewest wordspossible ;
and asthishadineach instance tobedone hur-
riedly, andatthemoment, there wasreason tofear
thatmuch thatwasmaterial toenable mefullyto
understand thequestion broughtbefore me,orthe
suitor tocomprehend myreply, mightbeuninten-
tionallyomitted.Lastly,Ihadonseveral occasions
reasons tobelieve that anative hesitated tostate
facts, ortoexpress feelings andwishes, toaninter-
preter,which hewould mostgladly havedone tothe
Governor, could hehave addressed him direct.
These reasons, andothers ofequal force,mademe

thiswasafarmore difficult matter than Ihadat
firstsupposed. ThelanguageoftheNew Zea-
landers isaverydifficult onetounderstand tho-
roughly:therewasthennodictionaryofitpub-
lished(unlessavocabularycanbesocalled) ;there
were nobooks pubhshedinthelanguage, which
would enable metostudyitsconstruction;it
variedaltogetherinform fromanyoftheancient
ormodern languages which Iknew;andmy
thoughtsand time were sooccupiedwith the
cares ofthegovernmentofacountrythenpressed
upon bymany difficulties, andwith aformidable
rebellionraginginit,that Icould findbutveryfew
hours todevote totheacquisitionofanunwritten
and difficultlanguage. I,however, didmy best,
andcheerfully devoted allmyspare moments toa
task, theaccomplishmentofwhich wasnecessary
toenable metoperform properly every dutyto
mycountry andtothepeopleIwasappointedto
govern.
Soon, however, anewandquite unexpecteddif-
ficulty presenteditself Ontheside oftherebel
party wereengaged,eitheropenlyorcovertly,some
oftheoldest, leastcivilised, andmost influential
chiefs intheIslands. With them Ihad either
personally,orbywritten communications, todiscuss
questions which involvedpeaceorwar,andon

which thewhole future oftheIslands andofthe
native racedepended,sothat itwas inthehighest
degTeeessential that Ishould fully and entirely
comprehendtheir thoughtsandintentions, andthat
theyshould notinanywaymisunderstand the
nature oftheengagementsintowhich Ientered
with them.
Tomy surprise, however,Ifound that these
chiefs, either intheirspeechestome,orintheir
letters, frequently quoted,inexplanationoftheir
views and intentions, fragmentsofancient poems
orproverbs,ormade allusions which rested on
anancientsystemofmythology;andalthoughit
was clear that themost important partsoftheir
communications wereembodied inthesefigurative
forms, theinterpreterswerequiteatfault, they
could thenrarely (ifever)translate thepoemsor
explaintheallusions, andtherewasnopubhcation
inexistence which threw any light nponthese
subjects,orwhich gavethemeaningofthegreat
mass ofthewords which thenatives uponsuch
occasions made useof;sothat Iwascompelledto
content myselfwith ashortgeneralstatement of
what some other native believed thatthewriter of
theletter intended toconveyashismeaning bythe
fragmentofthepoemhehadquoted,orbythe
allusions hehadmade. Ishould add,thateven the
great majorityoftheyoungChristian natives were

Clearly, however, Icould not,asGovernor ofthe
country, permitsoclose aveil toremain drawn
between myself andtheagedandinfluentialchiefs,
whom itwasmydutytoattach toBritish interests
and totheBritish race,whoseregard and confi-
dence, asalsothat oftheirtribes,itwasmydesire
tosecure, andwithwhom itwasnecessarythat I
should holdthemost unrestricted intercourse.Only
onething could, under suchcircumstances, bedone,
andthatwas toacquaint myself with theancient
languageofthecountry,tocollect itstraditional
poemsandlegends,toinduce theirprieststoim-
parttometheirmythology, and tostudytheir
proverbs.Formore thaneight yearsIdevoted a
great partofmyavailable time tothesepursuits.In-
deed Iworked atthisdutyinmyspare moments
inevery partofthecountryItraversed, andduring
mymany voyagesfromportiontoportionofthe
Islands. Iwasalsoalways accompanied bynatives,
and still atevery possibleintervalpursued myin-
quiriesintothesesubjects. Once,when Ihadwith
great painsamassed alargemass ofmaterials toaid
meinmystudies, theGovernment House was de-
stroyed byfire,andwith itwere burnt themate-
rials Ihad socollected, andthus Iwas left to
commenceagainmydifficult andwearyingtask.


PREFACE. IX
The ultimate result, however, was, that Iac-
quiredagreat amount ofinformation onthese
subjects, and collected alargemass ofmaterials,
which was, however, from themanner inwhich
theywereacquired,inaveryscattered state—for
differentportionsofthesamepoemorlegend were
often collected from different natives, inverydis-
tantpartsofthecountry ;longintervals oftime,
also, frequently elapsedafter Ihadobtained one
partofapoemorlegend,before Icould find a
nativeaccurately acquainted with anotherportion
ofit;consequentlythefragmentsthus obtained
were scatteredthroughdifferent note-books, and,
beforetheycould begiventothepublic, required
tobecarefully arranged and re-written, and,what
was stillmore difficult(whether viewed inrefer-
ence totherealdifficultyoffairly translatingthe
ancientlanguageinwhichtheywerecomposed,or
mymany public duties),itwasnecessary thatthey
sliould betranslated.
Having, however, withmuch toilacquiredin-
formation which Ifound souseful tomyself,I
feltunwillingthattheresult ofmylabours should
belost tothose whose dutyitmaybehereafter

therefore undertook anew task, which Iliave

chants andsongsoftheMaori race,and Inow

principal portionsoftheir ancientmythology, and

Another reason that hasmademeanxious to

Withregardtothestyleofthetranslation a

That their traditions arepuerile,istrue;thatthe

would befound innorespectstosurpassthatone

understand. Ibelieve that theignorance which
hasprevailed regardingthemythological systems
ofbarbarous orsemi-barbarous races hastoogene-
rallyledtotheirbeingconsidered fargrander and
more reasonable thanthey reallywere.
But thepuerilityofthese traditions and bar-
barous mythological systems bynomeans dimi-
nishes theirimportanceasregardstheir influence
uponthehuman race. Those contained inthepresent
volumes have, withslight modifications, prevailed
perhaps considerably more thantwothousandyears
throughoutthegreatmass oftheislands ofthe
Pacific Ocean;and, indeed,tliereligious systemof
ancient Mexico was,probably,tosome extent con-
nected with them. Theyhave been believed in
andobeyed bymanymilhons ofthehuman race;
and itisstillmore melancholytoreflect thatthey
were based uponasystemofhuman sacrifices to
thegods;sothat ifweallowthem tohave existed
fortwothousandyears, andthat, inaccordance with
theriteswhich arebased upon them, atleasttwo
thousand human victims wereannuallysacrificed
throughoutthewhole extent ofthenumerous
islands inwhichthey prevailed (bothofwhichsup-

positionsareprobably much within thetruth),then
atleast four millions ofhumanbeingshave been
offered insacrifice tofalsegods;andtothisnumber
weshould have toaddafrightfullistofchildren
murdered under thesystemofinfanticide, which
thesame traditionsencouraged,asalsoavery large
number ofpersons destroyedforhavingbeen be-
lievedguiltyofthecrime ofsorceryorwitch-
craft.
Itmust fm-ther beborne inmind, thatthenative
races,who believed inthese traditions orsupersti-
tions, areinnowaydeficient inintellect, andinno
respect incapableofreceivingthetruths ofChris-
tianity ;onthecontrary, they readily embrace its
doctrines andsubmit toitsrules;inour schools
theystand afaircomparison withEuropeans, and,
when instructed inChristian truths, blush attheir
own formerignorance andsuperstitions, andlook
backwithshame andloatliing upontheirprevious
state ofwickedness andcredulity ;andyetfora
great partoftheir liveshavethey, and, forthou-
sands ofyearsbeforetheywere born, have their
forefathers, implicitlysubmitted themselves tothose
very superstitions, andfollowed those cruel and
barbarous rites.

(kONGATAMA AKANGI—TRADITION RELATING TOTHEORIGIN OF
THEHUMAN RACE.)
Menhadbutonepairofprimitive ancestors;they
sprangfrom thevastheaven that exists aboveus,
andfrom theearthwhich hesbeneath us. Accord-
ingtothetraditions ofourrace,Rangi andPapa,
orHeaven andEarth, were thesource fromwhich,
inthebeginning,allthings originated. Darkness
then rested upontheheaven andupon theearth,
andtheystillboth clavetogether,fortheyhadnot

begotten were everthinking amongst themselves
whatmightbethedifference between darkness
andlight ;theyknew thatbeings hadmultiplied

sion oftime, unto thetenth, tothehundredth, to

and these divisions oftimes were considered as
beings, andwere eachtermed aPo;andontheir
account therewas asyetnoworld with itsbright
light, but darknessonlyforthebeings which
existed.
Atlastthebeings whohadbeenbegotten by
Heaven and Earth, worn outbythecontinued
darkness, consulted amongst themselves, saying,
"Letusnowdetermine whatweshould dowith
Rangi andPapa,whether itwould bebetter to
slaythem ortorendthemapart. ThenspokeTu-
matauenga,the fiercest ofthechildren ofHeaven
andEarth,"Itiswell,letusslaythem."
Thenspake Tane-mahuta, thefather offorests
andofallthingsthat inhabit them, orthat are
constructed fi-om trees, "Nay,not so. Itisbetter
torendthemapart, and tolettheheaven stand
faraboveus,andtheearth lieunder our feet. Let
theskybecome asastrangertous,buttheearth
remain close tousasournursingmother."
Thebrothers allconsented tothisproposal, with
theexceptionofTawhiri-ma-tea, the father of
winds andstorms, andhe,fearingthat hiskingdom
wasabout tobeoverthrown, grieved greatlyatthe
thoughtofhisparents beingtornapart.Five of

thebrotherswillinglyconsented totheseparation
oftheirparents,butoneofthemwould notagree
toit.
Hence, also, thesesayingsofoldarefound inour
prayers,"Darkness, darkness, light, light,theseek-
ing,thesearching,inchaos, inchaos;"thesesig-
nified thewayinwhich theoffspringofheaven
andearthsoughtforsomemode ofdealing with
theirparents,sothathumanbeings might increase
and live.
So,also, thesesayingsofoldtime,"Themulti-
tude, thelength,"' signifiedthemultitude ofthe
thoughtsofthechildren ofHeaven and Earth,
and thelengthoftime theyconsidered whether
theyshouldslaytheirparents,thathumanbeings
mightbecalled intoexistence;for itwas inthis
manner thattheytalked and consultedamongst
themselves.
But atlengththeirplans havingbeenagTeed

rises upandstruggles,butineffectually. Lo,
then, Tu-matauenga,thegodand father offierce
humanbeings,risesupandstruggles,but he,too,
fails inhis efforts. Then, atlast, slowly uprises
Tane-raahuta, thegodand father offorests, of
birds, andofinsects, and hestruggleswith his
parents ;invain hestrives torendthemapai't

pauses not,heregardsnottheir shrieks and cries;

Hence thesesayingsofolden time,"Itwasthe
fiercethrustingofTane which tore theheaven
from theearth, sothattlieywere rentapart, and
darkness wasmade manifest, and sowas the

Nosooner washeaven rentfrom earth than the
multitude ofhumanbeingswere discovered whom
theyhadbegotten, andv/hohad hitherto laincon-
cealed between thebodies ofRangi andPapa.


THECHILDEEN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 5
Then, also, there arose inthebreast ofTawhiri-
ma-tea, thegodandfather ofwinds and storms, a
fierce desire towagewarwith hisbrothers, because
theyhadrentaparttheircommonparents. He
from the firsthadrefused toconsent tohismother
beingtornfrom herlordandchildren;itwas his
brothers alone thatwished forthisseparation,and
desired thatPapa-tu-a-nuku,ortheEarth alone,

Thegodofhurricanes andstorms dreads also
thattheworld should become too fairand beauti-
fiil,soherises, follows hisfather totherealms

thick clouds, fiery clouds, clouds whichprecede

ofthese Tawhiri-ma-tea himself sweeps wildlyon.
Alas !alas! thenragesthe fierce hurricane;and
whilst Tane-mahuta and hisgiganticforests still

From theforests andtheir inhabitants Tawhiri-

inhiswrath theocean. Ah !ah !waves steepas

hehadbegottentwo children, Ika-tere, thefather
offish,andTu-te-wehiwehi, orTu-te-wanawana, the
father ofreptiles.
When Tangaroafled forsafetytotheocean, then
Tu-te-wehiwehi and Ika-tere, and their children,
disputed togetherastowhat theyshould doto
escapefrom thestorms, andTu-te-wehiwehi and
hispartycried aloud,"Letusflyinland;"but
Ika-tere and hispartycried aloud,"Letusflyto
thesea." Some would notobeyone order, some
would notobeytheother, andthey escapedintwo
parties:thepartyofTu-te-wehiwehi, ortherep-
tiles, hidthemselves ashore;thepartyofPunga
rushed tothe sea. This iswhat,inourancient
religious services,iscalled theseparationofTa-
whiri-ma-tea.
Hence these traditions havebeenhanded down :—"
Ika-tere, the fiither ofthingswhich inhabit
water, cried aloud toTu-te-wehiwehi,'Ho,ho,let
usallescapetothe sea.''
"ButTu-te-wehiwehi shouted inanswer,'Nay,

"Then Ika-tere warned him, saying,'Flyin-

"But Tu-te-wehiwehi answered liim, saying,

"Then withoutdelaythese two races ofbeings
separated.The fish fled inconfusion tothesea,
thereptiles sought safetyinthe forests and

Tangaroa, enragedatsome ofhischildren desert-

onhisbrother Tane, who, inreturn, haswaged

Hence Tanesuppliestheoffspringofhisbrother

Tawhiri-ma-tea next rushed ontoattack his

hadshown himself brave and fierce inwar;his
brothers hadyieldedatonce before thetremendous

Tu-matauenga,orfierce man, havingthus suc-

Thus Tu-matauengadevoured allhisbrothers,

When hisbrothers had allthus been overcome
byTu',heassumed several names, namely, Tu-ka-

hisbrothers wereentirely deposed byhim,andbe-

Some were forHaumia-tikitiki, theywere called

Thereason thathesoughtoutthese incantations
was, that hisbrothers mightbemadecommon by

another, and cried out,"Hollo, where did this

answered,"Ah, I'myourchild too." Then the
oldwoman counted them alloveragain, andsaid,
"Oh,no,thereoughttobeonlyfour ofyou ;now

His brothers feltquite surprised andpleased
with their little brother when theyheard himtalk
inthisway,andwhen after alittle timetheyhad
recovered from their amazement, theytoldhim to
tryand find their father and mother. Sohe
saidhewouldgo.Itwasalongtime agothat
hehad finished his first labom-, forwhen he

What made himnowlook sowell iatheshape

Maui, after thesethings,returned tohisbrothers
totellthem that hehadfound hisparents, andto
explaintothem wheretheydwelt.


THELEGEND OFMAUI. 33
ShortlyafterMaui had thus returned tohis
brothers, heslewand carried offhis firstvictim,
whowasthedaughterofMaru-te-whare-aitu;after-
wards, byenchantments, hedestroyedthecropsof
Maru-te-whare-aitu, sothattheyallwithered.
Hethenagain paidavisit tohisparents, and
remained forsome timewiththem, andwhilst hewas
there heremarked thatsome oftheirpeople daily
carried awayapresentoffood forsomeperson;at
length, surprisedatthis,heonedayasked them,—
"Who isthatyouaretakingthatpresentoffood
to?"And thepeople whoweregoingwith it
answered him,—"Itisforyour ancestress, for
Muri-ranga-whenua."
Heaskedagain,—"Where does shedwell?"
They answered,—"Yonder."
Thereupon hesays,—"That willdo;leave here
thepresentoffood, Iwillcarryittohermyself."
From thattime thedaily presentsoffood forhis
ancestress were carried byMaui himself; buthe
never tookandgavethem toherthat shemight
eatthem, buthequietlylaidthembyononeside,
and thishedid formany days. Atlast,Muri-

going on,and thenext time hecamealongthe

thoughtthat shemust have been mistaken;but
shemade onemore trial, and sniffed thebreeze
towards thewestward. Ah !then thescent ofa
mancameplainlytoher,soshecalled aloud—"I
know from thesmell wafted here tomebythe
breeze thatsomebodyisclose tome,"andMaui
murmured assent. Thus the oldwoman knew
thathewasadescendant ofhers,andherstomach,
which wasquite largeand distended, immediately
begantoshrink, and contract itselfagain.Ifthe
smell ofMaui hadnotbeen carried toherbythe
western breeze, undoubtedlyshewould have eaten
himup.
When thestomach ofMuri-ranga-whenua had
quietly sunkdown toitsusual size, hervoice
wasagainheardsaying, "Art thouMaui?" and
heanswered, "Even so.''
Then sheasked him, "Wherefore hast thou
served thyoldancestress inthis deceitful way?"

andMaui answered,"Iwasanxious thatthyjaw-
bone, bywhich thegreat enchantments canbe
wrought,should begiventome."
Sheanswered,"Takeit,ithasbeen reserved for
thee." AndMaui tookit,andhaving done so
returned totheplace where heand hisbrothers
dwelt.
Theyoung hero, Maui, hadnotbeenlongat
home with hisbrothers when hebegantothink,
that itwastoosoon after therisingofthesunthat

His brothers inthemeantime hadarranged

And hisbrothersreplied,"Where didyougeta

And ashepulleditoutfrom under hisgarments,

that thehookwascarved andornamented with
tufts ofhairpulled from the tailofadog,and it
lookedexceedinglybeautiful. Maui thenasked his
brothers togivehimalittle bait tobait liishook
with;butthey replied,"We willnotgiveyou
anyofour bait." Sohedoubled his fistand
struck hisnoseviolently, andthebloodgushed out,
andhesmeared hishookwith hisown blood for

alongtheoutside carved rafters ofthe roof, and

ofMaui-tikitiki-o-Taranga caughtfirstinthe sillof
thedoorway.
Then, feeling something onhishook, hebegan
tohaul inliishne.Ah !ah !there ascended on
hishook thehouse ofthat oldfellowTonga-
nui. Itcameup,up ;and asitrosehigh, oh,
dear !how hishookwas strained with itsgreat
weight ;andthen there camegurgling upfoam
and bubbles from the earth, asofanisland
emergingfrom thewater, and hisbrothers opened
their mouths and cried aloud.
Maui allthistime continued tochaunt forth
hisincantations amidst themurmurings andwail-
ingsofhisbrothers, who were weepingand


THELEGEND OFMAUL 43
lamenting,andsaying,"Seenow,how hehas
broughtusoutinto theopen sea,thatwemaybe
upsetinit,anddevoured bythe fish." Then
heraised aloud hisvoice, andrepeatedtheincan-
tation called Hiki, which makes heavy weights
light,inorder that the fishhehadcaught might
comeupeasily, andhechanted anincantation
beginning thus,—
"Wherefore, then, oh !Tonganui,
Dostthouhold fastsoobstinately below there 1"
When hehadfinished hisincantation, there floated
up,hangingtohisline,thefishofMaui, aportion
oftheearth, ofPapa-tu-a-Nuku.Alas! alas! their
canoelayaground.
Maui then left hisbrothers with their canoe,
andreturned tothevillage ;butbefore hewent
hesaid tothem, "After Iamgone, becou-
rageousandpatient ;donoteatfood \mtil Ire-

Maui hadhardly gone,aftersayingallthis to
them, than hisbrotherstrampledunder their feetthe
words theyhadheard himspeak. They beganat
once toeatfood,andtocutupthefish.When they
did this,Maui hadnotyetarrived atthesacred

Thus wasdryland fishedupbyMaui after it
hadbeen hidden under theocean byEangi and
Tawhiri-ma-tea. Itwaswith anenchanted fish-
hook that hedrew itup,which waspointed with

andrefused toobeythecommands which their mas-

Atlast,Maui said tohismother,"Well;then

Karihi said,"Wewillhide ourselves here,forwe

After shehad lived with thesetwo brothers for

hisascent totheheavenly regions.
Rupecontinued hisascent, seeking everywhere

spoketothem, saying,"Are theheavens above

answered him,"Theyareinhabited." And he

saying, "Are theheavens above these inhabited?"
and thepeopleanswered him,"Theyareinha-

canreach them?" andthey replied, "No,youwill
notbeable toreach them, those heavens were fixed

Rupe, however, forced away throughthose
heavens too,andthushecontinued todountil he
reached thetenth heaven, andthere hefound the
abode ofRehua. When Rehua sawastranger
approaching,hewent forward andgavehim the
usual welcome, lamentingoverhim;Rehua made
hislamentation without knowing who thestranger
was,butRupeinhislament made useofprayers
bywhich heenabled Rehua toguesswhohewas.
Whentheyhadeach ended their lamentation,
Rehua called tohisservants,"Lightafire,and
geteverything readyforcookingfood." The
slaves soonmade the fireburn upbrightly, and
broughthollow calabashes,allreadytohave food

nestling there, feeding uponinsects;and asthey
flew forth, theslavescaught and killed them, and
filled thecalabashes with them, andtookthem
tothefii'e,andputthem ontocook, andwhen
theywere done, theycarried them and laidthem
before Rupeasapresent,andthenplaced them
beside him that hemight eat,and Reliua re-

"Nay,but Icannot eatthis food;Isaw these

whowould dare toeatbirds thathad fedupon

hethus stated, Rupefeared thatman ofancient

theycontinuegreasytothisday,sothat ifKoromiko

Tinirau continuedanxiouslytolook forthere-

her,"Oh,youcannot mistake him, histeeth are

Well,away they paddled, and induetimethey
arrived atthevillageoftheoldmagician Kae,and
histribe allcollected toseethestrangers ;towards
night, when itgrew dark, afirewaslightedin

Inorder tofind outwhich wasKae, Tinirau's
peoplehadarranged,thattheywouldtrybywit

THELEGEND OFRATA,
HISADVENTURES WITH THEENCHANTED TREEANDREVENGE
OFHISfather's MURDER.
Before Tawliaki ascended upinto theheavens, a
sonnamed Wahieroa hadbeenborn tohimbyhis
first wife. Assoon asWahieroa grewtoman's
estate, hetookKura forawife,and sheborehim
asonwhomtheycalled Rata. Wahieroa was slain
treacherously byachief named Matukutakotako,
but hissonRatawasbornsome time before his
death. Ittherefore became hisdutytorevenge
thedeath ofhisfather Wahieroa, andRatahaving
grown up,atlastdevised aplanfordoing this; he
therefore gavethenecessaryorders tohisdependants,
atthesame timesayingtothem,"Iamabout to
goinsearch ofthemanwhoslewmyfatlier.''
Hethen started uponajourneyforthispurpose,
andatlengtharrived attheentrance totheplace
ofMatukutakotako;hefound there amanwho
was leftinchargeofit,sittingattheentrance to
thecourt-yard,andheasked him, saying,"Where
isthemanwho killedmyfather?" Themanwho

was leftinchargeoftheplace answered him—
"Helivesbeneath intheearth there, and Iamleft
herebyhim, tocalltohimandwarn himwhen
thenewmoonappears ;atthatseason herisesand
comes forthupontheearth, anddevours men as

Rata then said tohim,"Allthatyousayistrue,
buthowcanheknowwhen thepropertimecomes
forhim toriseupfrom theearth?" Theman re
plied,"Icallaloud tohim."
Then said Rata,"When will there beanew

oftheplace answered him,"Intwonights hence.
Do3^ounowreturn toyourownvillage, butonthe
morningoftheseconddayfrom thistimecome

Rata,incompliancewith these directions, re-
turned tohisowndwelling, andwaited there
until thetime that hadbeenappointed him,
andonthemorningofthatdayheagain jour-
neyed alongtheroad hehadpreviously travelled,
andfound themansittinginthesameplace,
andheasked him, saying,"Doyouknow anyspot

They thenwenttogetheruntil theycame tothe

Themanthen said toRata, "Thespotthatwe

Rata then asked theman,"Will hemake his
appearancefrom theearth thisevening?"And
themananswered, "Yes.'^
Theyhadnotwaitedlong there,whenevening
arrived, andthemoon becamevisible, andtheman
said toRata,"Doyounowgoandhideyourself
near thebrink ofthefountain inwhich hewashes

theedgeofthefountain, andthemanwhohad
been lefttowatch forthepurposeshouted aloud,
"Ho,Ho, thenewmoon isvisible—amoon two

fountain where hedressed his hair, andkneeling
down onboth knees besideit,heloosened the
strings which bound uphislong locks, andshook

intothecool clear waters ofthefountain. SoRata
creepingoutft'omwhere helayhid,rapidly moved
up,andstood behind him,andasMatuku-takotako
raised hishead from thewater, Rata with one
hand seized himbythe hair, while with theother
hesmote andslewhim;thusheavengedthedeath
ofhisfather Wahieroa.
Rata thenasked themanwhom hehadfound in
chargeoftheplace,"Where shall Ifindthebones

place answered him,"Theyarenothere;astrange
people who live atadistance came and carried

Upon hearing this.Rata returned tohisown

When Rata heard themsay this,heAvasquite

TheoffspringofTaneagainallcalled outaloud

Inthemorning some ofthePonaturirepaired

withoutdelay, theypursued him.Athousand war-

TeRata's ttisk ofavenginghisfather's death
beingthus ended, histribe hauled uphislarge

when thissoncame toman's estate, hetookApa-

When theyheard this,oneofthem rantofetch

From that timeWliakatau leftthewater and
continued toliveonshore. Hisprincipal amusement,
aslongashewasalad,was stillfl3'^ing kites; but
heunderstoodmagic well,andnothingwas con-

Tinirau determined toattempttoavenge thedeath ofhisde-

thatWhatakau ishere;" buttheytoldherthat themanwhohad
spoken tohermust havebeenWhakatau himself, andthat shehad
better return tohim,and toldhermarks bywhich shemight
knowhim
;shetherefore returned, and he,aftersome time,when
sheshowed him that sheknew certain marks about hisperson.

admitted thathevrasWhakatau;andhethen asked herwhat
hadmade hercome tohim? andshereplied,"Tinirau sentmeto
youtoaskyoutocome and assist inrevenging thedeath ofour
near relative;thewarriors are allcollecting atthevillage of
Tinirau, butthey fear togotoattack thisenemy, for itisthe
bravest ofalltheenemies ofTinirau." Whakatau thenasked her,
"Have you yetgiven afeast tothewarriors?" andshe said,
"Notyet."Hethenspoketoher, saying,"Return atonceand
when youreach your village, giveagreatfeast tothewarriors;
givethem abundance ofpotted birds from the forests, but letall
the oilinwhich thebirds werepreservedbekeptforme;asfor
yourself, donotgotothe feast, but,decking yourhead witha
mourningdi-css offeathers, remain seated close inthehouse of
mourning." Then Hine-i-to-iwaiwa atonce returned toTinirau, to
doasshehadbeen directed.
Shortlyafter hisvisitor had lefthim,Whakatau called aloud to
hispeople, saying,"Letthesideboards beatonce fresh lashed on
toourcanoe, tothecanoe ofourancestor ofRata." Hismenwere
soanxious tofulfil their chief's orders, thatalmost assoon as
hehadspoken theywere atwork, andbad finished thecanoe
thatvery day,anddraggeditdown tothesea;when night fell,
sixofhiswarriors embarked init,andWhakatau made the
seventh;theythen paddled oif,following adirect course, until
theyreached thevillage ofTinirau;where theyfound Hine-i-te-
iwaiwa seated inherhouse ofmourning. Whakatau thenasked
her,"Have thewarriors allleftyet?" andshereplied,"Theywill
notdoit,they areafraid." AVhakatau then said toher,"Farewell,
then;doyouremain here untilyouhear further fromme."
Whakatau andhismenhaving re-embarked intheir canoe,made
astraight course fortheplace where wassituated thegreat house
called theTihi-o-Manono, andtheylettheir anchor drop, and
floated there.
When thenextmorning broke, andsome ofthepeople ofthe
village coming outofthehouse, andbeyond their defences, saw
thecanoefloatingattheanchorage, theygave thealarm, crying-
out,"A M'arparty!awarparty!" Then thewarriors came
rushingforth tothefrayincrowds, andarranged themselves in
bands. Then stood forth oneoftheirchampions whose name was
Mangohuritapcna, andhedefied Whakatau, whowasstanding up
inhiscanoe, calling out,"Were youfoolenough, then,tocome

outWhakatau inreply. Then thechampionoftheenemy gave a
plungeintothewater, anddived under it.Just ashegotright
under thecanoe, oneofWhakatau's men poured the oilwhich
Hine-i-te-iwaiwa hadgiven them intothesea,and itswaters im-
mediately became quite transparent, sothattheysawthewarrior
come floating upunder thecanoe, andAVhakatau transfixed him
with awooden spade ;sothatchampion perished.
Then forward stepped another champion named Pitakataka, and
hedefied Whakatau, shouting out,"Ah! youonlykilled Mango-

Whakatau shouted outinreplj',"Which ofthearts ofwarare

swered Whakatau;andthechampion ofhisenemies took arun
andmade aspring high into theair;butWhakatau laidanoose

And thus, oneafter theother, heslewtenofthemostfamous

alive, buthecutouthistongue, andthen said tohim,"Now,
offwithyoutotheshore again, and tellthem there hoAV Ihave
overcome youall;"having done this,Whakatau retired alittle
distance back from theplace,sothat hiscanoe could notbeseen
byhisenemies.
Intheafternoon Whakatau landed onthecoast, andbefore eat-
inganything,offered theprescribedsacrifice oftlichairandaj^art

when thereligiousriteswere finished, heeatfood;andhaving
done thi.s, hedii'ected thepeople hehadwithhim toreturn,
saying, "Eeturn atonce, andwhen youreach theresidence of

said,'Ifheavyrain falls inlarge drops,itisasignthat Ihavebeen

toHine-i-te-iwaiwa todeliver themessage hehadgiven them.
Just before nightfall, Whakatau drew nearthegreat house, called
theTihi-o-Manono, and asthepeopleofWhitinakonako, agreat

When their fireshadburnt upbrightly, some ofthem called outto
Mango-Pare,themanwhom Whakatau hadsaved alive, andwhose
tongue hehadcutout,"Well, now, telluswhat kind oflooking

"There isnoone Icancompare him to,hewasnot likeaman in

Whakatau himself thenexclaimed, "Was heatalllikeme?"And

Then allthevillage begantoassemble tosee

Theythen felled atotara tree inRarotonga,

Wheneveningcame on,Rua' tlu-ew himself into

morningintothestars oftheevening,and thiswas
accomplished.Inthemeantime theArawa scudded
awayfaroutontheocean, andNgatoro thoughtto
himself,"What arate thiscanoegoesat—what a

other endofthestringinhishand, andthen he
climbedupontheroof. Hehadhardly gotonthe

andhecunninglyuntied tlieendofthestring which
Ngatorohadfastened toherhair,andmade itfast
tooneofthebeams ofthecanoe, andNgatorofeel-

that itwas still fasttoher.AtlastNgatoro came
downagain, andTama-te-kapuaheard thenoise of

headagain,buthejumpedasfastashecould into
hisown berth, which wasnext tothat ofNgatoro,
andNgatoro,tohissurprise,found oneendofthe
stringtied fasttothebeam ofthecanoe.
Then heknew that hiswifehadbeen disturbed
byTama', andheasked her,saying,"Oh,wife, has
notsome onedisturbed you?"Then hiswife re-
phedtohim,"Cannot youtellthatfrom thestring-
beingfastened tothebeam ofthecanoe?" And
thenheasked her,"Who wasit?"And shesaid,
"Whowasit,indeed ?Could itbeanyoneelsebut
Tama-te-kapua?"Then herhusband said toher,
"You areanoblewoman indeed thus toconfess

Then thatpriest again went forthupontheroof

theheavens, inthesamewaythat R.ua'did,andhe
changedthestars oftheeveningintothose ofmorn-

thecrew ofthecanoe were attheir wits' end,and

Then oneofthechiefs ofthecanoe cried outto

whilst hisbrothers were outsnaring birds, and

He finished allthe calabashes ofpreserved

sothat hiscruel brothersmight laughathim, saying,
"Oh,never mind him;those arenot real tears,

Next dayHatupatu stoppedathome, and off
went hisbrothers tosnarebirds, andhebeganto
steal thepreservedbirdsagain,andthus hedid
every day, every day,and ofcourse atlast his
brothers suspected him,andonedaytheylaid in

crouched into thestorehouse andbegan eating.
"Ha, ha,ha,we'vecaught younow then;your

nodivision wasplacedunder hiscommand.
Hatupatu knew that thejealousyofhisbro-

LEGEND OFTHEEMIGRATION OFTURI,
(theprogenitok ofthewhanganuitribes.)
Thefollowingnarrative shows tliecause which led
Turi, the ancestor oftheWhanganui tribes,to
emigratetoNew Zealand, andthemanner inwhich
hereached these islands.
Hoiraatua, anear relation ofTuri, hadalittle
boynamed Potikiroroa;thisyoungfellow was
sentonedaywith amessagetoUenuku, whowas
anariki, orchiefhigh-priest,tolethimknow
that aburnt-offering hadbeenmade tothegods,
ofwhich Uenuku, asariki, was toeatpart, and
the little fellowaccidentally tripped and felldown
intheverydoorwayofWharekura, thehouse of
Uenuku, and thisbeingamostunlucky omen,
Uenuku was dreadfully irritated, and helaid
hold ofthe little fellow, and atehimup,without
evenhavingthebody cooked, and sothepoorboy
perished.
Turiwasdetermined tohaverevengeforthis
barbarous act,andtoslaysomepersonasapay-
ment forlittle Potikiroroa, and, aftercasting about


THEEMIGRATION OFTURI. 203
inhisthoughtsforsome time astothemost effec-
tualmode ofdoing this,hesawthat hisbestway
ofrevenginghimself would betoseizeHawepotiki,
the little sonofUenuku, and killhim.
OnedayTuri, inorder toentice theboyto
hishouse, ordered thechildren ofallthepeople
who dwelt there withhim tobegin playing toge-
ther, inaplacewhereHawepotikicould seethem;
sotliey began whippingtheirtops,andwhirling
theirwhizgigs, but itwas ofnouse;the little
fellow could notbetemptedtocomeandplaywith
them, and thatplanfailed.
Atlastsummer came with itsheats, scorching
men's skins; andTuri, oneveryhotday,ordered
allthe little children torunandbathe intheriver
Waimatuhirangi ;sotheyallrantotheriver and
began sporting andplayinginthewater. When
littleHawepotiki saw alltheother ladsswim-
mingandplayingintheriver, hewasthrown off
hisguard andrantheretoo,andTuriwaylaid him,
and killed him inamoment, andthusrevenged
thedeath ofPotikiroroa.
Afterkillingthepoor boy,Turi cut the
heart outofhisbody, which waseaten byhim-
selfandhisfriends; butwhen, shortly afterwards,

sent ofbaskets offood totheir sacred^^I'ince,to

processionofpeople,some ofTuri's friends
pushedinto thebasket ofbaked sweetpotatoes
preparedforUenuku theheart ofTeHawepotiki,
cutupandbaked too,andsoitwascarried upto
Uenuku inthebasket, and laid before him, that
hemighteat it.
Uenuku, whohadmissed hislittleboy,beingstill
unable toascertain what hadbecome ofhim, could
nothelp sighing when hesawsuch anexcellent
feast, andsaid,"Poor little Hawepotiki, how he
would have liked this,buthenownolongercomes
runningtositbymysideatmealtime ;"andthen
hehimself atethefood thatwas laid before him.
Hehadhardly, however, ended hismeal, when
oneofIllsfriends, whohadfound what hadbeen
done, came and told him, saying,"They have
made youeatapartofHawepotiki." And he
answered,"
"Very well,let itbe;hehesinthe
bellyofToi-te-huatahi ;"meaning bythisproverb,
thathewould have afearfulrevenge ;buthe
showed noothersignsoffeeling,thathemight not
gratifyhisenemies bymanifestinghissorrow, or
alarm thembyloud threats ofrevenge.
AtthistimeTuriwaslivinginahouse, thename
ofwhich wasRangiatea, and there wereborntwo
ofhischildren, TurangaimuaandTaneroroa. One
evening, shortlyafter thedeath ofTeHawepotiki,
Rongo-rongo,Turi'swife,went outofthehouse to

suckle her littlegirl, Taneroroa, and sheheard
Uenuku inhishouse, named Wharekura, chanting
apoem, ofwhich tliiswasthebiu-den :—
"Oh !letthetribes besummoned from thesouth,

Andsweep them utterly away.

WhenRongo-rongoheard whatUenuku was
chanting,shewent back toherhouse, and said
toherhusband, "Turi, Ihavejust heard them
chantingthispoeminWharekm-a." And Turi
answered,"What poemdoyousayitwasVThen

knew this well, because, ashehadkilled thechild
ofUenuku, heguessedthattheymeant toslayhim
asapaymentfortheboy,andthat thelament
hiswifehadheard evmced thattheyweresecretly
layingtheirplansofrevenge.
He,therefore, atonce started offtohisfather-
in-law, Toto, togetacanoe from him,inwliicli he
might escapefrom hisenemies;andTotogave
him one, thename ofwhich wasAotea; thetree
from which ithadbeen madegrew uponthe
banks oftheLake Waiharakeke. Toto had
firsthewn down thetree, and thensplit it,
breakingitlengthwaysintotwoparts;out of
onepartofthetree hemade acanoe, which
henamed Matahorua, and outoftheotherpart
hemade acanoe which henamed Aotea. He
gave the canoe which hehadnamed Mata-
horua toKuramarotini;andthecanoe which he
hadnamed Aotea hemade apresentoftoRongo-
rongo ;thus givingacanoe toeach ofhistwo
daughters. Matahorua was thecanoe inwhich a
large partoftheworld wasexplored, andRetiwas

OnedayKupeandHotm-apa went outuponthe

merestratagem uponthepartofKupe,that he
might obtainpossessionofKm-amarotini, whowas
Hoturapa's wife;however, Hoturapanotsuspect-

came uptothesurface ofthewater, thecanoe was
alreadyalongdistance from him,andhecried out
toKupe,"Oh,Kupe, bringthecanoe back here to
takemein." ButKupe would notlisten tohim,
hebrought notback thecanoe, and soHoturapa
perished. Kupethenmadehaste, and carried off
Kuramarotini, and toescapefrom thevengeanceof
therelations ofHoturapa,hefledawaywithher,
ontheocean, inhercanoe Matahorua, and dis-
covered theislands ofNew Zealand, and coasted
entirely round them, withoutfinding anyinhabi-
tants.
AsKupewasproceeding down theeastcoast of

New Zealand, andhad readied Castle Point, a
great cuttle-fish, alarmed atthesightofacanoe
withmen init,fledawayfrom alargecavern
which exists inthesouth headland ofthecove
there;itfledbeforeKupe,inthedirection ofRau-
kawa, orCook's Straits;when Kupearrived at
those straits, hecrossed them inhiscanoe, to
examine themiddle islands;seeingtheentrance of
Awa-iti, (now called Tory Channel,) running deep
upinto the land, heturned hiscanoe inthere
toexploreit;hefound avery strongcurrent
comingoutfrom between thelands, andnamed
theentrance Kura-te-au;strongasthecurrent
was,Kupe stemmed itinhiscanoe, andascended
it,until hewasjust surmountingthecrown
oftherapid.Thegreatcuttle-fish ordragon,
thathad fledfrom Castle Point, which Kupe
named TeWheke-a-Muturangi, orthe cuttle-fish
ofMuturangi, had fled toTory Channel, and
waslyinghidinthispartofthecurrent. The
monster heard thecanoe ofKupe approachingas
theywerepulling upthecurrent, and raised its
arms above thewaters tocatch anddevour the
canoe, menand all.As itthus floated uponthe
water, Kupe sawit,andpondered howhemight

soKupeseized animmense hollow calabash he

severed itintwo,andkilled it.*
The labours ofKupeconsisted inthis, that he
discovered theseislands, andexamined thedifferent
openings which hefoundrunning upintothecoun-
try.Heonlyfound twoinhabitants inthecoun-

other birdwhich henamed theTiwaiwaka;he,
however, didnotultimately remain inthese islands,

Thus heleft hismarks here,buthehimself re-
turned tohisowncountry, where hefound Turi
and allhispeoplestilldwelling ;althoughitwas

Turi's brother-in-law, Tuau, now called outto
him,"Why, Turi, thepaddles youaretakingwith

Atlastawayfloated thecanoe, whilst itwas

whenthey gottoitsmouth, Turi called outtohis

and satdown with thepeople there, whilst Turi
went astern andtook hispaddle.Then Turiand
hispeople pulledashard asthey could, andwere

When allthese ceremonies were ended, avery
angrydiscussion arose between Potoru andTuri, as
tothedirectiontheyshould now sailin

saying,"Nay, nay,letus still sailtowards the

stillpersistedinhisopinion, and atlastTurigave
upthepoint, and lethimhave hisownway ;so
theyembarked and lefttheisland ofRangitahua,
and sailed onawesterlycourse.
Aftertheyhadpursuedthis course forsome

When theRirino hadthusbeenlost, Turi, inthe
Aotea., pursuedhiscourse towards thequarterofthe
rising sun,and wliilsttheywereyetinmid-ocean,
achild, v^^liom henamed Tutawa, wasborn to
Turi;theyhadthenbutnine sweetpotatoes left,

into thesea, thesebeing old, dirty,and faded,

wrongly,theredthings theysaw insuch abun-

AtlengththeAotea isrunuponthebeach of

thetribe ofManaia heard what hadtakenplace,
theyallarose toseek revenge ;but before the
fightingwhich arose from this affair broke out,
Manaia went tothepeople whohadwrongedhis

Allthesepreparations havingbeen made, Ma-

when theopportunityofrushingontheir enemies

son, Tu-ure-nui, whowaslying byhisside, to

in,andkillingthe firstman oftheenemy ;but
beingafraid togohedidnotmove, andwhilst
Manaia wasencouraging him invain, another
young man, thename ofwhose father hadnever
been toldbyhismother, rushed forward andslew
the first oftheenemy, and aswith hisweaponhe
struck himdown, hecried out,"The first slain of
theenemy belongstome, toKahu-kaka-m^i, the

born son;hehad beforethoughtthat Tu-ure-nui
hadbeen hisonlyson;butwhen theotheryoung
man called outhisname, heknew thathealsowas
hisson,and,pleasedwith hiscourage,heloved him
very much..
Thepeople lyinginambush,allfollowed the
youthwhen herushed ontheirenemies, andslaugh-

till atlength Manaia becjan toreflect within
himself, saying,"Ah,ah,mywarriors arewasting
away, andbyandbye, perhaps,Ialso shall be
slain;rather than letthis state ofthings continue,
Ihadbetter abandon thiscountry, and,removing
toagreat distance, seek anew one formyself

Having made uphismind toactinthisway,he

HoTUNUi wasoneofthose chiefswho arrived in
New Zealand from alandbeyondtheocean. The
Tainui wasthecanoe inwhich hearrived inthese

andcame overland toHauraki, andfinallytook
uphisresidence inavillagecalled Whakatiwai.
Hehad atKawhia, asoncalled Maru-tuahu, but
Hotunui wasnottherewhen this childwas born.
Thecause which made himcome fromKawhia
toHauraki was afalse accusation thatwas
brought againsthimregardingastore-house of
sweetpotatoes belongingtoanotherchief, afriend
ofhis. The accusation arose inthisway. Ho-
tunui went outofhishouse onenight,almost at
thesamemoment thatathief hadgoneouttorob
thisstorehouse;itwasveryunfortunate thatthey
should both havegoneoutnearlyatthesame
moment, justaboutmidnight. When daydawned,
Hotunui came outofhishouse, andpeopleinthe
morninghad seen hisfootsteps, right alongthe

pathbywhich thethief hadgone, andthere were
thesweetpotatoes droppedallalongthepath, and
asthesoles ofHotunui's feetwerevery large,his
footprints hadquite erased those ofthethief; so
presently theybrought anaccusationagainst Ho-
tunui, thathehad stolen thesweetpotatoes. At
thistimeHotunui's wifehadjustconceived Maru-
tuahu, buthewas soovercome byshame atthe
accusationbrought against him, that thethought
came into hismind torunawayfrom wifeand
all,andgotoHauraki toseek another resi-

Hotunui went offtoHauraki, andresided atWha-

country, and hetook anotherwife, theyoung

said,"What, there?" andheAvasanswered byhis
mother,"Yes, that isit—Hauraki;"andMaru-

Then Maru-tuahu started with his slave, and
travelled towards Hauraki, andtheycarried with
them aspearforkillingbirds;thistheytook
asameans ofprocuringfood onthejourney,
astheycame bywayofthewooded moimtains
where birds areplentiful ;they were awhole

AllthistimeMaru-tuahu waspeeping down at

thenasked him tocome totheirvillagewiththem;
towhich heconsented, but said,"Youtwogoon

well,doyoucome after us." Maru-tuahu then told
hisslave tomake apresenttothegirlsofthefood

STORY OFMARU-TUAHU. 255
Whilst Maru-tuahu waslivingatHauraki, his
father Hotunui toldhimhowvery badly some of
thepeopleofthatplacehad treated him;these
were thefacts ofthecase, astheoldchief related
them tohim.—"Oneday,when thecanoes ofthe
tribecame infulloffish, afterhaulingtheirnets,
hesentdown oneofhisservants from hishouse
tothecanoe tobringback some fish forhim,
andwhen theservant randown forthispurpose,
themanwho owned the nets said tohim,
'Well, whatbrings youhere ?'upon which his
servant answered,'Hotunui sentmedown, to

Hotunui inthemost violent and offensive manner,
saying,'Ishishead theflax thatgrowsinthe

anetforhimself with, instead oftroublingme?'
When Hotunui's servant heardthis,hereturned at
once tothehouse, and hismaster notseeingthe
fish, said,'Well,tellmewhat isthematter;'so
hereplied,'Iwent asyoutoldme,and Iasked
themanwhohadbeenhaulingthenet forsome

man cursedyou,sayingtome,IsHotunui's head

histopknot flax, that theoldfellow cannotgo

When Hotuhui had told thisstorytoMaru-
tuahu, hesaid,"Now oh,myson, this tribe isa
verybad one,theyseem bentupon loweringthe
authorityoftheir chiefs."
Theheart ofMaru-tuahu feltverygloomy when
heheard hisfather hadbeen treated thus, and
Hotunui said tohim,"Youmaywelllook sad,my
son,athearingwhat Ihavejustsaid;this tribe is
composedofverybadpeople." AndMaru-tuahu
replied,"Leave them alone, theyshall findoutwhat
suchconduct leads to."
Then Maru-tuahubegantocatch anddrygreat

hismen atmaking fishing-nets,until hehad col-
lected avery great number;itwas inthewinter
thathebegantomake these nets,andthewinter,

theywere finished;then hesentamessengerto
thetribewhohadcursed hisfather, toaskthem to

About thetime thatTeKahureremoa, Paka's

Atlengtli,thefame ofthis sorcererspreadex-

Tamure, achiefwho dwelt atKawhia, heard with
others, reportsofthemagical powersofKiki,for
hisfame extended over thewholecountry. At
length Tamurethoughthewouldgoandcontend
intheartsofsorcery with Kiki, that itmightbe

they landed, anddrewuptheir canoe onthebeach,

Assoon astheyhad landed, theoldsorcerer

tocome and eatfood with him;butthefood
was allenchanted, and hisobjectinasking Ta-

old sorcerer, Kiki, kept waitingforTaraure to

Tamure now ordered hispeopletolaunch his

afterthey had leftthevillage,Kiki became un-

werepaddling homewards inallhaste, and as
they passedavillage where there were agood

Some time after Tamure'sparty had leftthe

This head bewitched allpersons whoapproached

allperished,from itsmagical influence, somewhere
about theplacewhere thebeaten trackpassesover

Thedeaths ofsomany personscreated agreat
sensation inthecountry, and, atlast, thereportof
these thingsreached averypowerfulsorcerer named
Hakawau, who, confidinginhismagical arts, said
hewasresolved togoandseethismagic head, and

inhisownenchantments, hewentfearlesslytotry
whether hisartsofsorcery would notprevailover
themagic head, andenable him todestroytheold
sorcerer Puarata.
Hetookwithhimonefiiend, andwentalong
thesea-coast towards theSacred Mount, andpassed
through Whanga-roa,and followed the sea-shore
toRangikahuandKuhawera, andcame outupon
thecoastagainatKaroroumanui, and arrived
atMaraetai;there was afortifiedvillage,the
peopleofwhich endeavoured todetain Hakawau
and hisfriend untiltheyrested themselves and

neither didthey stop there, butonthey went,

thestench wassobadthat itwasquite suffocating,
andtheybothnow said,"This isafearfulplace ;

rested,forthe firsttime sincetheyhadcommenced
theirjourney. Theyhadnotyetbeen seenbythe
watchmen ofthe fortress. Then Hakawau, with
hisincantations, sent forthmany genii,toattack


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 283
thespirits whokeptwatch over thefortress and
magic head ofPuarata. Some ofhisgood genii
were sentbyHakawau inadvance, whilst he
chargedothers tofollow atsome distance. The
incantations bythepowerofwhich thesegeniiwere
sentforthbyHakawau wasaWhangai. Thegenii
hesent infront were orderedimmediatelytobegin
the assault. Assoon asthespirits whoguarded
the fortress ofPuarata saw the others, theyall
issued outtoattack them;thegood genii then
feignedaretreat, the evil onesfollowing them,
andwhilstthey were thusengagedinthepur-
suit,some ofthethousands ofgood genii, who
had lastbeen sent forth byHakawau, stormed
thefortress now leftwithout defenders;when, the
evilspirits, whohadbeen ledawayinthepursuit,

geniiofHakawau hadalready gotquiteclose toit,
andthegood geniiofHakawau without trouble
caught them one after theother, andthus allthe
spiritsoftheoldsorcerer Puarata wereutterly
destroyed.
When allthe evilspirits whohadbeensubject
totheoldsorcerer hadbeen thusdestroyed, Haka-

hadused inlikemanner tocanythem about. When
thewatchmen ofthefortress, totheirgreatsur-

magic head, tocallupon it;hissupplication was
after thismanner—"
Strangers, come here !strangers
come here !Two strangers come !two strangers
come !"But itutteredonlyalowwailingsound;
forsince thegood geniiofHakawau haddestroyed
thespirits who served Puarata, theoldsorcerer
addressed invain hissupplicationstothemagic
head,itcould nolongerraise aloud itspowerful
voice asinformer times, bututteredonlylowmoans
and wails. Could ithave cried outwith aloud
voice, straightway Hakawau and hisfriend would

and travellers had inother timespassedthe for-
tress, Puarata addressedsupplicationstohismagic
head, andwhen itcried outwith amighty voice,
thestrangersallperishedastheyheard it.
Hakawau and hisfriend had, inthemeantime,
continued towalkstraighttothe fortress. When
theydrew nearit,Hakawau said tohisfriend,
"Yougodirectly alongthepaththat leadsby
thegatewayinto the fortress; asforme,Iwill
showmypowerover theoldsorcerer, byclimbing
rightover theparapet andpalisades:"andwhen
theyreached the defences oftheplace,Haka-

gateway. When thepeopleoftheplacesawthis,
theyweremuchexasperated, anddesired him, in
anangry manner, topassunderneath thegateway,
alongthepathway which wascommon toall,and
nottodare toclimb overthegatewayofPuarata and

thegateway, withoutpayingtheleast attention to
theangiy words ofthosewhowerecalhngoutto
him,forhefeltquitesurethatthetwooldsorcerers
were not soskilful inmagicalarts ashewas;so
Hakawaupersistedingoingdirect toallthemost
holy placesofthefortress, where noperson whohad

AfterHakawau and hisfriend hadbeen fora

Once uponatime, aman ofthename ofKaliu-

Butwhen hecame tolookalittlemorenarrowly

TEKANAWA'S ADVENTURE WITH A
TROOP OFFAIRIES.
TeKanawa, achief ofWaikato, -wasthemanwho

This chief happenedonedaytogoouttocatch
kiwis with hisdogs,andwhen night came onhe

Assoon asitwasdarktheyheard loud voices,

butwhere couldtheyrunto?fortheywere inthe
midst ofaforest, onthetopofalonely mountain,
and itwasdarknight.
Foralongtime thevoices grewlouder andmore
distinct asthefairies drew nearer and nearer, until
theycamequiteclose tothe fire;TeKanawa
andhisparty were halfdeadwithfright. Atlast
the fairiesapproachedtolook atTeKanawa, who
was averyhandsome fellow. Todothis, they
kept peeping slilyover thelargeroots ofthetree
under which thehunters werelying, andkeptcon-
stantly lookingatTeKanawa, wliilst hiscompa-
nions werequiteinsensible from fear. Whenever
the fireblazed upbrightly,ofi"went thefairies and
hidthemselves, peepingoutfrom behindstumps

wliicli hewore asaneck ornament, andaprecious

wasonly tryingtoamuse andpleasethem tosave

todeath. However, the fairies didnotrush on
themen toattack them, butonlycamequiteclose
tolook atthem. Assoon asTeKanawa had
taken offhisneck ornament, andpulledouthis
jasper ear-ring,and hisotherear-ring, made ofa
tooth ofthetiger-shark,hespreadthem outbefore
thefairies, and offered them tothemultitude
whoweresittingallround about theplace;and
thinking: itbetter thefairies should nottouch him,
hetook astick, andfixingitinto theground,
hunghisneck ornament andear-rings uponit.
Assoon asthefairies hadended theirsong, they
took theshadows oftheear-rings,andhanded them
about from onetotheother,until theyhadpassed
throughthewholeparty,which thensuddenlydis-
appeared,andnothing morewasseen ofthem.
The fairies carried offwiththem theshadows of
allthejewelsofTeKanawa, buttheyleftbehind
them hisjasperneck ornament and hisear-rings,
sothathetookthem backagain,thehearts ofthe
fairies being quitecontented atgettingtheshadows
alone;they saw, also, thatTeKanawa wasan
honest, well-dispositionedfellow. However, the

(genus)consisted ofalimma orminor half tone, amajor

contracted thenext tone,andextended thelast; thelatter
wascalled softdiatonic.
The chromatic, which consisted ofsemitone, semitone,
onetoneandahalf interval, ornearlyourminor third,
was called tonaceon, andhadtwo modifications, one
called hemiolion, andtheother malakon;these shades or
modifications seem oflater invention, andsoon tohave
fallen into disuse.
Theenharmonic consisted ofaquarter tone, aquarter

Isaac Vossius* from amultitude ofauthorities, has
established, that transitions weremade byancientsingers
andperformers,from thediatonic tothechromatic and
enharmonic, withthegreatest facility; andheadds,•'which,
because themoderns cannot do,theyevenpositively and seri-

paper, byMr.Vincent, from certain MSS. intheKingof
France'slibrary.
Dr.Barney,incommon withmost othermodern writers
onthesubject, says,"theintervals ofthe close enhar-
monic tetrachord
z3± -TP-
appear wholly strangeandunmanageable," andhence it
hasbeen concluded thattheenharmonic wasimpossiblein
practice.
Dr.Burney, however, onedayreceived aletter from his
friend Dr. Paissell, regardingthe"state ofmusic inAra-
bia,and totheDoctor's utter astonishment, helearnt from
that letter thattheArabian scale ofmusic wasdivided into
quartertones;andthatanoctave, which, uponourkeyed
instruments isonlydivided into12semitones, intheAra-
bian scale contained 2A,forallofwJiichtheyhadparticxdar

This latter observation would seem totallyverywell
withwhat Mr.Lane*saysofthecanoon{y.a.vu))ofthe
present Arabs, which, hesays, has24treble notes.Only,
thatheadds, eachnotehasthreestringstoit,which(later,
asweshallsee)heaffirms tohavebeen thirdsoftones. If
so,thesystemisashade ofthechromatic;and ifMr.
Lane isright (andhegivesadrawingoftheinstrument).

Mr.Vincent*givesamost scientificdescriptionofan
elaborate instrument made atParis, exhibited attheIn-
stitut, onwhich thequarter tones were mostcorrectly
illustrated, andobserves, that amuch less interval than
thequarter-tone, perhaps eightortentimes less, isdis-
cernible, asproved byaM.Delezenne,f 1827; andour
ownears attest thatuniversallyinthemodulations ofthe
voice oftheso-calledsavage tribes, andintherefined and
anomalously-studied Chinese, there areintervals which do
notcorrespondtoanynotes onourkeyed instruments, and
which toanuntrained earappear almost monotonous.
There isanother matter withwhichincidentally wehave
todo,namely,anapparentdifference ofopinion between
ancient authors themselves about theenharmonic. Plu-
tarch|saysthatAristoxenus(inabook notnowextant)
informs usthatOlympus wastheinventor ofanenhar-
monic, butofakindconsistingofascale inwhich certain
notes, the"lichaui" or"iudicatrices," were omitted, and
thatthe airs ofOlympuswere sosimple and beautiful,
that there wasnothinglikethem.

Mypoint is,toprovethat theancients didpossess and
practiseamodulation which contained much less intervals
than ours,andthat such, oranapproachtosuch, modula-
tion(though probablybutimperfect)isstill retained
among somepeople,and that theprinciplesonwhich the
Greeks founded their enharmonicgenus,still survive in
naturalsong, thoughIwillnotbeboldenoughtoassert
thatsometimes thesesongs maynotchangeintooneof

notbeable todecide. Onething, however, iscertain, that,
asAristoxenus tells us,noperfectearcould modulate
more than twodieses atatime(andthen there wasa
"saltus" orinterval oftwotones), and astheNew Zea-
landsongs frequentlyexhibit more than tivoclose intervals

discern, themodulation ofsome oftheNew Zealand
melodies;and shall show astillnearerapproachtothe
systemoftherealGreek enharmonic, inaChinese air
which Iheard andnoted.
Afewremarks onthesystem itself, the intervals, and
thenotation.
SYSTEM.
First, thatanenharmonic modulation mightexist is
admittedbymany modern writers. Mr.Donkiu, forin-
stance, author oftheable article onAncient Music in
Dr.W.Smith's"DictionaryofGreek andRoman Anti-
quities," observes(underthetitleof"Music")ofthediffer-
entgeneralessfrequently named,*"that itwould be
wrongtoconcludehastilythattheothers would beimpos-
sible inpractice,ornecessarily unpleasing ;"andoftheen-
harmonic hesays,"but itisimpossibletoform ajudgment
ofitsmerits without amuchgreater knowledgeofthe
rules ofcompositionthanseems nowattainable."
Mr.LayTradescanthavingshown thedifferences of
interval oftheChinese instruments from theintervals
generallyinuse inEurope,adds—"Itwill therefore
very readily appear from therespective rules, that the
character ofthemusic, or, ifyou please,themood(he
should have said"genus"), must beverydifferent from
ourown, andthatnone ofourinstruments(heshould
have saidkeyedorbored)arecapableofdoing jus-
tice toanyairthat isplayedonthekin"(orscholar's
lute). Hesubjoins:"Inmytravels Isometimes tvrote
doirn the airs that Ihadheard amongthenatives, but
thoughItookmuchpainstolearn themaccurately,I

always foundtheyhad lostsomethingoftheirpeculiaritywhenplayed upon theviolin.
"Thereason ofthisdefect seems tohavebeen thatthe
intervals oftheIndian music didnotagi-eewiththose of
Europe."*
Mr. Tradescant might have added, that there will
always besome difference inanairplayedontheguitar
andontheviolin, thoughtheintervals used areesteemed
thesame;and, again, perhaps thelearned traveller did
nottake care todivide thescale ofhisviolin mathemati-
cally, likethat ofthekin, before hetried the eff'ect;he
mightalsonothave noted theright interval. Hecon-
cludes :"There is,however, aconnection between theChi-
neseand oldScotch music, sothatwhenanyhighly-ad-
mired airsofScotlandhappentofallwithin thecompass
ofthekin,theyseem athomewhenplayed uponthis in-
strument."
Mr.Lanesaysthe"canoon" oftheArabians hadtwenty-
four notes. Dr.Russell toBurney saysthattheArab scale
oftwenty-four notes wasequaltoone octave. ButMr.
Lane adds, that"themost remarkablepeculiarityinthe
Arabsystem ofmusic isthedivision oftones into tJiirds."
Hence, fromthesystemoithirds oftones, Ihaveheard the
Egyptian musiciansurge against theEuropean systems of
music thattheyaredeficient inthenumberofsounds.
Thesame remark wasmade tomebySelim A«ar, a
Nubian, whensinging someAmharicsongs:"Your instru-
ment"(piano),said he,"isverymuch outoftune, and
jumps verymuch."
Mr.Lane adds: "These small anddelicategradations of
soundgiveapeculiar softness totheperformances ofthe
Arabmusicians, which aregenerallyofaplaintive cha^
*LayTradescant's"Chinese asthey Are."


APPENDIX. 325
racter; buttheyare difficult todiscriminate with exact-
ness, and therefore seldom observed inthevocal and
instrumental music ofthosepersons whohave notmade a
regular studyoftheart."
HadMr.Lane beendescribingthecharacter and diffi-
culties oftheancient Greek enharmonic orchromatic, he
could nothave used other terms;theyarealmost the
words ofAristoxenus, Vitruvius, Plutarch, andother an-
cient writers onthesegenera;andyet,headds,"hetook
great delightinthemore refined kind ofmusic," and
found"themore hebecame habituated tothestylethe
more hewaspleasedwith it."Hecontinues :"Hewas
perfectlycharmed with theperformanceofsome female
singers,andthatthenatives aresofascinated astolavish
considerable sums onthem."

consecutive gamutofquarter-tones —no;wearetold dis-
tinctly byallauthors(except, perhaps, Salinas),thatthere

that Iwillnotvouch forthemathematical exactness :nei-
ther will Ipledge myself nottohave written achromatic

thiswould nothave heen discernible, nor tlien tomany
