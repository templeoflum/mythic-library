HELPS TOPRONOUNCIATION
There arethree simple rules which practically control
Hawaiian pronunciation: (1)Give eachvowel theGer-
man sound. (2)Pronounce each vowel. (3)Never
allow aconsonant toclose asyllable.
Interchangeable consonants aremany. The follow-
ingarethemostcommon: h^=s; l=r;k=t;n=ng;
v=w.


PREFACE
Maui isademigodwhose name should prohably be
pronounced Ma-u-i, t.c.Ma-oo-e. Themeaning^ ofthe
word isbynomeans clear. Itmaymean "tolive," "to
.subsist." Itmay refer tobeauty andstrength, oritmay
have theideaof"the lefthand" or"turning aside." The
word isrecognized asbelonging toremote Polynesian
antiquity.
MacDonald, awriter oftheNew Hebrides Islands,
gives thederivation ofthename Maui jirimarily from
theArabic word "Mohyi." which means "causing to
live" or"life." applied sometimes tothegodsandsome-
times tochiefs as"preservers and sustainers" oftheir
followers.
TheMaui story probably contains alarger munber of
unique andancient myths than thatofanyother legend-
arycharacter inthemythology ofanynation.
There arethree centers forthese legends, New Zea-
land inthesouth. Hawaii inthenorth, andtheTahitian
group including theHervey Islands intheeast. Ineach
ofthese groups ofislands, separated bythousands of
miles, there arethesame legends, told inalmost thesame
way,andwith very little variation innaincs. The inter-
mediate groups ofislands ofeven asgreat importance as
Tonga, FijiorSamoa, possess thesame legends inmore
orlessofafragmentary condition, asifthethree centers
hadbeen settled firstwhen thePolynesians were driven
away from theAsiatic coasts bytheir enemies, the
vi


Malays. From these centers voyagers sailing away in
search ofadventures would carry fragments rather than
complete legends. This isexactly what hasbeen done
and there areasaresult alarge number ofhints of
wonderful deeds. The really long legends astoldabout
thedemigodMa-u-i and hismother Hinanumber about
twenty.
Itisremarkable that these legends have kept their
individuality. ThePolynesians arenotavery clannish
people. Forsome centuries theyhave notbeen inthe
habit offrequently visiting each other. They havehad
nowritten language, andpicture writing ofanykind is
exceedingly rarethroughout Polynesia andyetinphysi-
cal traits, national customs, domestic habits, and lan-
guage, aswell asintraditions andmyths, thedifferent
inhabitants oftheislands ofPolynesia areasnear ofkin
asthecousins oftheUnited States andGreat Britain.
TheMaui legends form oneofthestrongest links in
themythological chain ofevidence which binds thescat-
tered inhabitants ofthePacific intoonenation. Anin-
complete listaids inmaking clear thefact thatgroups
ofislands hundreds andeven thousands ofmiles apart
have been peopled centuries pastbythesame organic
race. Either complete orfragmentary Maui legends are
found inthesingle inlands and island groups ofAnei-
tyum, Bowditch orFakaofa, Efate, Fiji,Fotuna, Gilbert,
Hawaii, Hervey, Huahine, Mangaia, Manihiki, Mar-
quesas, Marshall, Nauru, New Hebrides, New Zealand,
Samoa, Savage, Tahiti orSociety, Tauna, Tokelau and
Tonga.
S.Percy Smith ofNew Zealand inhisbookHawaiki
mentions alegend according towhich Maui made a
voyage afterovercoming aseamonster, visiting theTon-
vii


gas. theTahitian group, \'ai-i orHawaii, andthePau-
motu Islands. Then Maui went ontoU-peru, which
Mr.Smith says"may bePeru." Itwas said thatMaui
named some oftheislands oftheHawaiian group, call-
ingtheisland Maui "Maui-ui inremembrance ofhis
tffurts inlifting uptheheavens." Hawaii wasnamed
Vai-i, andLanai was called Ngangai—asifMaui had
found thethree most southerly islands ofthegroup.
TheMaui legends possess remarkable antiquity. Of
course, itisimpossible togiveanydefinite historical date,
butthere canscarcely beanyquestion oftheir origin
among theancestors ofthePolynesians before they scat-
tered over thePacific ocean. They belong tothepre-
historic Polynesians. TheNew Zealanders claim Maui
asanancestor oftheir most ancient tribes andsome-
times classhimamong themost ancient oftheir gods,
calling him "creator ofland" and "creator ofman.'"
Tregear, inapaper before theNew Zealand Institute,
said thatMaui wassometimes thought tobe"the sun
himself," "the solar fire," "thesungod," while hismother
Hinawas called "themoon goddess." Thenoted green-
stonegodoftheMaoris ofNew Zealand, Potiki. maywell
beconsidered arepresentation ofMaui-Tiki-Tiki, who
wassometimes called Maui-po-tiki.
Whether these legends came tothepeople intheir so-
journ inIndia before they migrated totheStraits of
Sunda isnotcertain ;but itmay well beas.sumcd that
these stories hadtaken firm root inthememories ofthe
priests who transmitted themost important traditions
from generation togeneration, and that thismust have
been (lone before theywere driven away from theAsiatic
coasts bytheMalays.
Several hints ofHindoo connection isfound inthe
viii


Maui legends. ThePolynesians notonlyascribed human
attributes toallanimal lifewithwhich theywere ac-
quainted, butalso carried theidea ofanalligator or
dragon withthem, wherever theywent, asinthemo-o of
thestory Tuna-roa.
The Polynesians alsohadtheidea ofadouble soul
inhabiting thebody. This iscarried out intheghost
legends more fully than intheMaui stories, andyet"the
spirit separate from thespirit which never forsakes man"
according toPolynesian ideas, wasapart oftheMaui
birth legends. This spirit, which canbeseparated or
charmed away from thebodybyincantations was called
the"hau." When Maui's father performed thereligious
ceremonies overhimwhich would protect himand
cause him.tobesuccessful, heforgot apart ofhis in-
cantation tothe"hau," therefore Maui lost hispro-
tection from death when hesought immortality for
himself and allmankind.
Howmuch these things aidinproving aHindoo or
rather Indian origin forthePolynesians isuncertain, but
atleast they areofinterest along thelines ofrace origin.
TheMaui group oflegends ispreeminently peculiar.
They arenotonly dififerent from themyths ofother na-
tions, butthey areunique inthecharacter oftheactions
recorded. Maui's deeds rank inahigher class thanmost
ofthemighty efforts ofthedemi gods ofother nations
and races, and areusually ofmore utility. Hercules
accomplished nothing tocompare with "lifting thesky,"
ix


"snaring thesun," "fishing forislands," "finding fire in
hisgrandmother's finger nails," or"learning from birds
how tomake firebyrubbing dry sticks," or"getting a
magic bone" from thejawofanancestor whowashalf
dead, that isdead onone sideandtherefore could well
aflFord toletthebone onthat sidegoforthebenefit ofa
descendant. TheMaui legends are fullofhelj-tful imagi-
nations, which aredistinctly Polynesian.
Thephrase "Maui oftheMale" isusedamong the
Hawaiians inconnection with tlienam^e Maui aKa-
lana,"Maui thesonofAkalana." Itmay bewell to
note theorigin ofthename. Itwas said thatHina
usually sentherretainers togather seamoss forher,
butonemorning shewentdown totheseabyher-
self. There shefound abeautiful redmalo, which she
wrapped around her asapa-u orskirt. WMien she
showed ittoAkalana, herhusband, hes])oke ofitas
agiftofthegods, thinking that itmeant the giftof
Mana orspiritual power totheir childwhen heshould
beborn. Inthisway theHawaiians explain thesuperior
talent andmiraculous ability ofMaui which placed him
above hisbrothers.
These stories were originally printed asmagazine
articles, chiefly intheParadise ofthePacific, Hono-
lulu;therefore there aresometimes repetitions which
itseemed best toleave, evenwhen reprinted inthe
present form.


I.
MAUrS HOME
"Akalana wastheman;
Hina-a-ke-ahi was thewife;
Maui Firstwasborn;
Then Maui-waena;,
Maui Kiikii wasborn;
ThenMaui ofthemalo."
—Queen Liliuokalani's Family Chant.
^I^OUR BROTHERS, each bearing thenarme of
Hri Maui, belong toHawaiian legend. They ac-^^ complished little asafamily, except on
special occasions when theyoungest ofthehousehold
awakened hisbrothers bysome unexpected trick
which drewthem intounwonted action. Thelegends
ofHawaii, Tonga, Tahiti, New Zealand andtheHer-
veygroup make thisyoungest Maui "the discoverer
offire" or"theensnarer ofthesun" or"thefisherman
who pulls upislands" or"themanendowed with
magic," or"Maui with spirit power." The legends


varysomewhat, ofcourse, butnotasmuch asmight
beexpected when thethousands ofmiles between
various groups ofislands aretaken intoconsideration.
Maui wasone ofthePolynesian demi-gods. His
parents belonged tothefamily ofsupernatural beings,
liehimself waspossessed ofsupernatural powers and
wassupposed tomake useofallmanner ofenchant-
ments. InNewZealand antiquity aMaui wassaid to
have assisted other gods inthecreation ofman.
Nevertheless Maui wasvery human. Helived in
thatched houses, hadwives and children, andwas
scolded bythewomen fornotproperly supporting his
household.
Thetime ofhissojourn among men isvery indefi-
nite. InHawaiian genealogies Maui and hisbrothers
were placed among thedescendants ofUluand"the
sons ofKii," andMaui wasoneoftheancestors of
Kamehameha, the firstking oftheunited Hawaiian
Islands. Thiswould placehim intheseventh oreighth
century oftheChristian Era. But itismore prob-
able thatMaui belongs tothemist-land oftime. His
mischievous pranks with thevarious godswould make
himanother Mercury living inanyagefrom thecre-
ation tothebeginning oftheChristian era.
TheHcrvey Island legends state thatMaui's father
was"the supporter oftheheavens" and hismother
"the guardian oftheroad totheinvisible world."
IntheHawaiian chant, Akalana was thename of


hisfather. Inother groups thiswas thename by
which hismother wasknown. Kanaloa, thegod, is
sometimes known asthefather ofMaui. InHawaii
Hina was hismother. Elsewhere Ina, orHina, was
thegrandmother, fromwhom hesecured fire.
TheHervey Island legends saythat fourmighty
ones lived intheoldworld fromwhich their ancestors
came. This oldworld bore thename Ava-iki, which
isthesame asHawa-ii, orHawaii. The fourgods
were Mauike, Ra,Ru,andBua-Taranga.
Itisinteresting totrace theconnection ofthese four
names with Polynesian mythology. Mauike isthe
same asthedemi-god ofNew Zealand, Mafuike. On
other islands thename isspelled Mauika, Mafuika,
Mafuia, Mafuie, andMahuika. Ra,thesungod of
Egypt, isthesame asRainNew Zealand andLa
(sun) inHawaii. Ru,thesupporter oftheheavens,
isprobably theKuofHawaii, andtheTuofNew
Zealand andother islands, oneofthegreatest ofthe
godsworshiped bytheancient Hawaiians. Thefourth
mighty onefrom Ava-ika wasawoman, Bua-taranga,
whoguarded thepath totheunderworld. Talanga in
Samoa, andAkalana inHawaii were thesame asTa-
ranga. Pua-kalana (theKalana flower) would prob-
ably bethesame inHawaiian asBua-taranga inthe
language oftheSociety Islands.
Ru,thesupporter oftheHeavens, married Bua-
taranga, theguardian ofthelower world. Their one


child wasMaui. The legends ofRaro-Tonga state
thatMaui's father andmother were thechildren of
Tangaroa (Kanaloa inHawaiian), thegreat godwor-
shiped throughout Polynesia. There were threeMaui
brothers andone sister, Ina-ika (Ina, the fish).
TheNew Zealand legends relate theincidents of
thebabyhood ofMaui.
Maui wasprematurely born, and hismother, not
caring tobetroubled with him, cutoffalock ofher
hair, tied itaround himandcasthimintothesea. In
thisway thename came tohim. Maui-Tiki-Tiki, or
"Maui form^ed inthetopknot." Thewaters borehim
safely. The jelly fishenwrapped andmothered him.
Thegodoftheseascared forandprotected him.He
was carried tothegod's house andhung upinthe
roof thathemight feelthewarm airofthe fire,and
becherished into life.When hewas oldenough, he
came tohisrelations while theywere allgathered in
thegreat House ofAssembly, dancing andmaking
merry. Little Maui crept inandsatdown behind his
brothers. Soon hismother called thechildren and
found astrange child,whoproved that hewasher
son,andwastaken inasoneofthefamily. Some of
thebrothers were jealous, buttheeldest addressed
theothers asfollows:
"Never mind; lethimbeourdear brother. Inthe
days ofpeace remember theproverb, 'When youare
onfriendly terms, settle your disputes inafriendly

way;when youareatwar,youmust redress your in-
juries byviolence.' Itisbetter forus,brothers, tobe
kind toother people. These aretheways bywhich
men gain influence—bylaboring forabundance of
food tofeed others, bycollecting property togive to
others, andbysimilar means bywhich youpromote
thegood ofothers."
Thus, according totheNew Zealand story related
bySirGeorge Grey, Maui wasreceived inhishome.
Maui's home wasplaced bysome oftheHawaiian
myths atKauiki, afoothill ofthegreat extinct crater
Haleakala, ontheIsland ofMaui. Itwas here he
livedwhen theskywas raised toitspresent position.
Herewaslocated thefamous fortaround which many
battles were fought during theyears immediately pre-
ceding thecoming ofCaptain Cook. This fortwasheld
bywarriors oftheIsland ofHawaii anumber ofyears.
Itwasfrom thishome thatMaui wassupposed to
havejourneyed when heclimbed Mt.Haleakala toen-
snare thesun.
Andyetmost oftheHawaiian legends place Maui's
home bytherugged black lavabeds oftheWailuku
river nearHiloontheisland Hawaii. Here helived
when hefound theway tomake firebyrubbing sticks
together, andwhen hekilled Kuna, thegreat eel,and
performed other feats ofvalor. Hewassupposed to
cultivate thelandonthenorth side oftheriver. His
mother, usually known asHina, hadherhome ina


lavacave under thebeautiful Rainbow Falls, one of
thefinescenic attractions ofHilo.Anancient dem.i-
god,wishing todestroy thishome, threw agreat mass
oflava across thestream below the falls. The rising
water was fast filling thecave.
liina called loudly toherpowerful sonMaui. He
came quickly andfound that alarge andstrong ridge
oflava layacross thestream. Oneendrested against
asmall hill.Maui struck therockontheother side
ofthe hillandthusbroke anewpathway fortheriver.
Thewater swiftly flowed away andthecaveremained
asthehome oftheMaui family.
According totheKing Kalakaua family legend,
translated byQueen Liliuokalani, Maui and his
brothers alsomade this place their home. Here he
aroused theanger oftwouncles, hismother's brothers,
whowere called "Tall Post" and"Short Post," be-
cause theyguarded theentrance toacave inwhich
theMaui family probably had itshome.
"They fought hard with Maui, andwere thrown,
andredwater flowed freely from Maui's forehead.
Thiswas the firstshower byMaui." Perhaps some
family discipline followed thisknocking down ofdoor
posts, for itissaid:
"They fetched thesacred Awa bush,
Then came thesecor^d shower byMaui;
Thethird shower waswhen theelbow ofAwawasbroken;
Thefourth shower came with thesacred bamboo."

Maui's mother, sosays aNew Zealand legend, had
herhom-e intheunder-world aswell aswith herchil-
dren. Maui determined tofind thehidden dwelling
place. Hismother would meet thechildren inthe
evening and liedown tosleep withthem andthen
disappear with the firstappearance ofdawn. Maui
remained awake onenight, andwhen allwere asleep,
arose quietly andstopped upevery crevice bywhich
arayoflight could enter. Themorning came andthe
sunmounted up—farupinthesky.Atlasthismother
leaped upand toreaway thethings which shut out
thelight,
"Oh, dear; oh,dear! Shesaw thesunhigh inthe
heavens ;soshehurried away, crying atthethought
ofhaving been sobadly treated byherown children."
Maui watched herasshepulled upatuft ofgrass
anddisappeared intheearth, pulling thegrass back
toitsplace.
ThusMaui found thepath totheunder-world. Soon
hetransformed himself intoapigeon andflewdown,
through thecave, until hesawaparty ofpeople under
asacred tree, likethose growing intheancient first
Hawaii. Heflew tothetreeandthrew down berries
upon thepeople. They threw back stones. Atlast
hepermitted astone from hisfather tostrike him,
andhefelltotheground. "They rantocatch him,
but lo!thepigeon hadturned into aman."
Then hisfather "took him tothewater tobebap-


tized" (possibly amodern addition tothelegend).
Prayers were oflfered andceremonies passed through.
But theprayers were incomplete andMaui's father
knew thatthegodswould beangry andcause Maui's
death, and allbecause inthehurried baptism apart
oftheprayers hadbeen leftunsaid. Then Maui re-
turned totheupper world and lived again with his
brothers.
Maui commenced hismischievous life early, for
Hervey Islanders saythatonedaythechildren were
playing agame dearly loved byPolynesians —hide-
and-seek. Here asister enters into thegame and
hides littleMaui under apile ofdry sticks. His
brothers could notfindhim,andthesister toldthem
where tolook. The sticks were carefully handled, but
thechild could notbefound. Hehadshrunk himself
sosmall thathewas likeaninsect under some sticks
and leaves. Thus early hebegan touseenchant-
ments.
Maui's home, atthebest,wasonly asorry affair.
Gods anddemigods lived incaves andsmall grass
houses. The thatch rapidly rotted andrequired con-
tinual renewal. Inavery short time theheavy rains
beatthrough thedecaying roof. Thehome waswith-
outwindows ordoors, save aslowopenings inthe
ends orsides allowed entrance tothose willing to
crawl through. Offonone sidewould betherude
shelter, intheshadow ofwhich Hina pounded the
10


bark ofcertain trees intowood pulpandthen into
strips ofthin, softwood-paper, which bore thename
of"Tapa cloth." This cloth Hina prepared forthe
clothing ofMaui and hisbrothers, Tapa cloth was
often treated toacoat ofcocoa-nut, orcandle-nut oil,
rmaking itsomewhat waterproof and alsomore dur-
able.
HereMaui lived onedible roots and fruits andraw
fish,knowing little about cooked food, fortheartof
firemaking wasnotyetknown. Inlater years Maui
wassupposed toliveontheeastern endoftheisland
Maui, and also inanother home onthelarge island
Hawaii, onwhich hediscovered how tomake fire
byrubbing drysticks together. MauiwasthePoly-
nesian Mercury. Asalittle fellow hewasendowed
with peculiar powers, permitting him tobecome in-
visible ortochange hishuman form into that ofan
animal. Hewasready totakeanything fromanyone
bycraft orforce. Nevertheless, like the thefts of
Mercury, hispranks usually benefited mankind.
Itisalittle curious thataround thedifferent homes
ofMaui, there issolittle record oftemples andpriests
and altars. Helived toofarback forpriestly customs.
Hisstory istherude, mythical survival ofthedays
when ofchurch and civilgovernment therewasnone
andworship ofthegods was practically unknown,
buteverymanwas alawunto himself, and also to
theother man, andquick retaliation followed any in-
jury received.

sharp angle. Thiswas usually aconsecrated bitof
bone ormother ofpearl, andwassupposed tohave
peculiar power tohold fastany fishwhich hadtaken
thebait.
These bones were usually taken from thebody of
some onewhowhile living hadbeen noted forgreat
power orhigh rank. This sharp piece was tightly
tied tothelarger bone orshell, which formed the
shank ofthehook. The sacred barb ofMaui's hook
wasapart ofthemagic bone hehadsecured from his
ancestors intheunder-world —thebone with which
hestruck thesunwhile lassooing himandcompelling
him tomove more slowly through theheavens.
"Earth-twisted" —fibres ofvines—twisted while
growing, was thecord usedbyMaui intying the
parts ofhismagic hook together..
Long andstrong were thefishlinesmade from the
olona fibre, holding thegreat fishcaught from the
depths oftheocean. The fibres oftheolona vinewere
among thelongest andstrongest threads found inthe
Hawaiian Islands.
Such ahook could easily becastloosebythestrug-
gling fish, iftheleast opportunity were given. There-
fore itwasabsolutely necessary tokeep theline taut,
and pullstrongly and steadily, toland thefish inthe
canoe.
Maui didnotusehismagic hook foralong time.
Heseemed tounderstand that itwould notanswer
15


ordinary needs. Possibly theidea ofmaking the
supernatural hook didnotoccur tohim until hehad
exhausted hislower witandmagic upon hisbrothers.
Itissaid thatMaui wasnotaverygood fisherman.
Sometimes hisendofthecanoe contained fishwhich
hisbrothers hadthought w^ere ontheir hooks until
theywere landed inthecanoe.
Many times theylaughed athim forhispoor suc-
cess,andheretaliated with hismischievous tricks.
"E!"hewould cry,when oneofhisbrothers began
topull in,while theother brothers swiftly paddled
thecanoe forward. "E!"Seeweboth have caught
great fishatthesamemoment. Becareful now.Your
line isloose. Look out !Look out!"
Allthetimehewould bepulling hisown line inas
rapidly aspossible. Onward rushed thecanoe. Each
fisherman shouting toencourage theothers. Soon the
lines bythetricky manipulation ofMaui would be
crossed. Then asthegreat fishwasbrought near the
side oftheboatMaui the little, themischievous one,
would slip hishook toward thehead ofthe fishand
flip itover into thecanoe—causing hisbrother's line
toslacken foramoment. Then hismournful cry
rang out:"Oh,mybrother, your fish isgone.Why
didyounotpullmore steadily? Itwas afine fish,
andnow itisdown deep inthewaters." Then Maui
helduphissplendid catch (from hisbrother's hook)
and received somewhat suspicious congratulations.
16


Butwhat could they do,Maui was thesmart oneof
thefamily.
Their father andmother were bothmembers ofthe
household ofthegods. The father was "the sup-
porter oftheheavens" and themother was "the
guardian oftheway totheinvisible world," but piti-
fully small andveryfewwere thegiftsbestowed upon
their children. Maui's brothers knew nothing beyond
theaverage home lifeoftheordinary Hawaiian, and
Maui alone wasendowed with thepower towork
miracles. Nevertheless thestudent ofPolynesian
legends learns thatMaui ismore widely known than
almost allthedemi-gods ofallnations asadiscoverer
ofbenefits forhisfellows, andthese physical rather
than spiritual. Aftermany fishing excursions Maui's
brothers seemed tohave witenough tounderstand
histricks, andthenceforth they refused totakehim
intheir canoe when theypaddled outtothedeep-sea
fishing grounds. Then thosewho depended upon
Maui tosupply their daily needs murmured against
hispoor success. Hismother scolded himand his
brothers ridiculed him.
Insome ofthePolynesian legends itissaidthat his
wives andchildren complained because ofhislaziness
and atlastgoaded him intoanew effort.
Theex-Queen Liliuokalani, inatranslation ofwhat
iscalled "the family chant," says thatMaui's mother
senthim tohisfather forahook withwhich tosup-
plyherneed.
17


"Go hence toyour father,
'Tisthere you find lineandhook.
This isthehook—'Made fast totheheavens—'
'Manaia-ka-lani'—'tis called.
When thehook catches land
Itbrings theoldseas together.
Bring hither thelarge Alae,
Thebird ofHina."
When Maui hadobtained hishook, hetried togo
fishing with hisbrothers. Heleaped ontheend of
their canoe astheypushed outintodeep water. They
were angry andcried out :"This boat istoosmall for
another Maui." Sotheythrew him offandmade him
swim back tothebeach. When they returned from
their day's work, they brought back only ashark.
Maui toldthcm^ ifhehadbeen withthem better fish
would have beenupon their hooks—theUlua, forin-
stance, or,possibly, thePimoe—theking offish.At
lastthey lethimgofaroutoutside theharbor of
Kipahula toaplace opposite KaIwioPele, "The
bone ofTele." apeculiar piece oflava lying near the
beach atHana ontheeastern side oftheisland Maui.
There they fished, butonly sharks were caught. The
brothers ridiculed Maui, saying: "Where arcthe
Ulua, andwhere isPimoe?"
Then Maui threw hismagic hook intothesea.baited
withoneoftheAlae birds, sacred tohismother Hina.
Heused theincantation. "When Iletgomyhook
with divine power, then Igetthegreat Ulua."

'Thebottom oftheseabegan tomove. Great waves
arose, trying tocarry thecanoe away. The fish
pulled thecanoe two days, drawing the line toits
fullest extent. \\''hen theslack began tocome inthe
line, because ofthetired fish,Maui called forthe
brothers topullhard against thecoming fish. Soon
land roseoutofthewater. Maui toldthem nottolook
back orthefishwould belost.Onebrother didlook
back—the line slacked, snapped, andbroke, andthe
land laybehind them inislands.
One oftheHawaiian legends also says that while
thebrothers were paddling infullstrength, Mauisaw
acalabash floating inthewater. Helifted itintothe
canoe, andbehold !hisbeautiful sister Hina ofthe
sea.The brothers looked, andtheseparated islands
laybehind them, freefrom thehook, while Cocoanut
Island—thedainty spot ofbeauty inHilo harbor—
wasdrawn up—alittle ledge oflava—inlater years
thehome ofacocoanut grove.
The better, themore complete, legend comes from
New Zealand, which makes Maui somischievous that
hisbrothers refuse hiscompanionship —andtherefore,
thrown onhisown resources, hestudies how tomake
ahookwhich shall catch something worth while. In
thislegend Maui isrepresented asmaking hisown
hook andthen pleading with hisbrothers tolethim
gowiththem once m.ore. Buttheyhardened their
hearts against him,andrefused again andagain.

Alaui possessed thepower ofchanging himself into
different forms. Atonetime while playing with his
brothers hehadconcealed himself forthem tofind.
They heard hisvoice inacorner ofthehouse—but
could notfindhim.Then under thematsonthe floor,
butagain theycould notfindhim. There wasonlyan
insect creeping onthefloor. Suddenly theysaw their
little brother where theinsect hadbeen. Then they
knew hehadbeen tricky with them. Sointhese
fishing days heresolved togoback tohisoldways
andcheat hisbrothers intocarrying himwiththem
tothegreat fishing grounds.
SirGeorge Gray says that theXew Zealand Maui
went out tothecanoe andconcealed himself asan
insect inthebottom oftheboat sothatwhen the
early morning light crept over thewaters and his
brothers pushed thecanoe into thesurfthey could
notseehim.They rejoiced thatMaui didnotappear,
andpaddled away over thewaters.
They fished alldayand allnight andonthemorn-
ingofthenext day, outfromamong the fish inthe
bottom oftheboatcame their troublesome brother.
They hadcaught many fine fishandwere satisfied,
sothought topaddle homeward ;but their younger
brother jdcad with them togoout, farout. tothe
deeper seasandpermit him tocast hishook. Hesaid
hewanted larger andbetter fishthananytheyhad
captured.

Sotheypaddled totheir outermost fishing grounds—but this didnotsatisfy Maui—
"Farther outonthewaters,
O!mybrothers,
Iseek thegreat fish ofthesea."
Itwas evidently easier towork forhimthan to
argue withhim—therefore farout intheseathey
went. Thehome land disappeared from view ;they
could seeonly theoutstretching waste ofwaters.
Maui urged them out still farther. Then hedrew his
magic hook from under hismalo orloin-cloth. The
brothers wondered what hewould doforbait. The
New Zealand legend says thathestruck hisnose a
mighty blow until theblood gushed forth.When this
blood becam.ie clotted, hefastened itupon hishook
and let itdown into thedeep sea.
Down itwent totheverybottom andcaught the
under world. Itwas amighty fish—butthebrothers
paddled with alltheir might andmain andMaui
pulled inthe line. Itwashard rowing against the
power which held thehookdown intheseadepths—
butthebrothers became enthusiastic over Maui's
large fish,andwere generous intheir strenuous en-
deavors. Every muscle was strained andevery pad-
dleheld strongly against theseathat notaninch
should belost. There wasnosudden leaping and
darting toand fro,no"give" totheline ;no"tremble"
21


aswhen agreat fishwould shake itself inimpotent
wrath when held captive byahook. Itwassimply a
struggle oftense muscle against animmensely heavy
dead weight. Tothebrothers therecame slowly the
feeling thatMaui was inone ofhisstrange moods
andthatsomething beyond their former experiences
with their tricky brother wascoming topass.
Atlastoneofthebrothers glanced backward. With
ascream ofintense terror hedropped hispaddle.
Theothers alsolooked. Then eachcaught hispaddle
andwith frantic exertion tried toforce their canoe
onward. Deepdown intheheavy waters theypushed
their paddles. Out ofthegreat seas theblack, ragged
head ofalarge island wasrising likeafish—itseemed
tobechasing themi through theboiling surf. Ina
little while thewater became shallow around them,
and their canoe finally rested onablack beach.
Maui forsome reason left hisbrothers, charging
them nottoattempt tocutupthisgreat fish. But
theunwise brothers thought theywould fillthecanoe
with part ofthisstrange thing which theyhadcaught.
They began tocutuptheback andputhuge slices
into their canoe. But thegreat fish—theisland—
shook under theblows andwithmighty earthquake
shocks tossed theboat ofthebrothers, and their
canoe wasdestroyed. Astheywere struggling inthe
waters, thegreat fishdevoured them. The island
came upmore andmore from thewaters—butthe
22


deep gashes made byMaui's brothers didnotheal—
theybecame themountains and valleys stretching
from seatosea.
White ofNew Zealand says thatMaui wentdown
intotheunderworld tom^eet hisgreat ancestress, who
wasonesidedeadandoneside alive. From thedead
sidehetook thejawbone, made amagic hook, and
went fishing. When heletthehookdown into the
sea,hecalled:
"Take mybait. ODepths!
Confused you are.ODepths!
Andcoming upward."
Thus hepulled upAo-tea-roa—one ofthe large
islands ofNew Zealand. On itwere houses, with
people around themi. Fires were burning. Maui
walked over theisland, sawwithwonder thestrange
menandthemysterious fire.Hetook fireinhishands
andwasburned. Heleaped intothesea,dived deep,
came upwith theother large island onhisshoulders.
This island hesetonfireand left italways burning.
Itissaidthatthename forNewZealand given toCap-
tainCook wasTeikaoMaui, "The fish ofMaui."
SomeNew Zealand natives saythathefished upthe
island onwhich dwelt "Great Hina oftheNight," who
finally destroyed Maui while hewasseeking immor-
tality.
One legend says thatMaui fished upapparently
23


fromXewZealand thelarge island oftheTongas. He
used thischant:
"OTonga-nui!
Why artThou
Sulkily biting, biting below?
Beneath theearth
Thepower isfelt,
Thefoam isseen,
Coming.
Othou loved grandchild
OfTangaroa-meha."
This isanexcellent poetical description ofthegreat
fishdelaying thequick hard bite. Then theisland
comes tothesurface andMaui, thebeloved grandchild
ofthePolynesian godKanaloa, ispraised.
Itwaspart ofoneofthelegends thatMaui changed
himself into abirdandfrom theheavens letdown a
linewithwhich hedrew upland, butthelinebroke,
leaving islands rather than amainland. About two
hundred lesser godswent tothenew islands inalarge
canoe. The greater gods punished them bymaking
them mortal.
Turner, inhisbook onSamoa, says there were three
Mauis, allbrothers. They went out fishing from
Rarotonga. One ofthebrothers begged the"goddess
ofthedeep rocks" tolethishooks catch land. Then
theisland Manahiki wasdrawn up.Agreat wave
washed two oftheMauis away. The other Maui
24


found agreat house inwhich eight hundred gods
lived. Here hemade hishome until achief from
Rarotonga drove himaway. He fled into thesky,
butasheleaped heseparated theland intotwo
islands.
Other legends ofSamoa say thatTangaroa, the
great god, rolled stones from heaven. Onebecame the
island Savaii, theother became Upolu. Agod is
sometimes represented aspassing over theocean with
abag ofsand. Wherever hedropped alittle sand
islands sprang up.
Payton, theearnest andhonored missionary ofthe
New Hebrides Islands, evidently didnotknow the
name Mauitikitiki, sohespells thename ofthefisher-
man Ma-tshi-ktshi-ki, andgives themyth ofthefish-
ingupofthevarious islands. The natives said that
Maui leftfootprints onthecoral reefs ofeach island
where hestood straining and lifting inhisendeavors
topullupeach other island. Hethrew hislinearound
alarge island intending todraw itupandunite it
with theoneonwhich hestood, buthislinebroke.
Then hebecame angry anddivided intotwo parts
theisland onwhich hestood. ThissameMaui isre-
corded byMr.Payton asbeing inafloodwhich put
outonevolcano—Maui seized another, sailed across
toaneighboring island and piled itupon thetopof
thevolcano there, sothe firewasplaced outofreach
oftheflood.
25


IntheHervey Group oftheTahitian orSociety
Islands thesame story prevails andthenatives point
outtheplace where thehook caught andaprintwas
made bythefoot inthecoral reef. Buttheyaddsom^e
very mythical details. Maui's magic fishhook is
thrown into theskies, where itcontinuously hangs,
thecurved tail ofthe constellation which we call
Scorpio. Then one ofthegodsbecoming angry with
Maui seized himandthrew himalsoamong thestars.
There hestays looking down upon hispeople. He
hasbecome afixed part ofthescorpion itself.
TheHawaiian myths sometimes represent Maui as
trying todraw theislands together while fishing them
outofthesea. \\'hen theyhadpulled u\)theisland
ofKauai they looked backandwere frightened. They
evidently tried torushaway from thenewmonster
andthusbroke the line. Maui tore asideoutofthe
small crater Kaula when trying todraw ittooneof
theother islands. Three aumakuas, three fishes sup-
posed tobespirit-gods, guarded Kaula anddefeated
hispurpose. AtHawaii Cocoanut Island broke off
because Maui pulled toohard. Another ])lacc near
Hilo onthelarge island ofHawaii where thehook
was said tohave caught isintheWailuku riverbelow
Rainbow Falls.
Maui went outfrom hishome atKauiki, fishing
with hisbrothers. After theyhadcaught some fine
fishthebrothers desired toreturn, butMaui persuaded
26


themi togooutfarther. Thenwhen theybecame tired
anddetermined togoback, hemade theseas stretch
outandtheshores recede until theycould seenoland.
Then drawing themagic hook, hebaited itwith the
Alae orsacred mudhenbelonging tohisMother Hina.
Queen Liliuokalani's family chant hasthefollowing
reference tothismyth:
"Maui longed for fishforHina-akeahi (Hina oftlie fire, his
mother),
Gohence toyour father,
There you will find lineandhook.
iManaiakalani isthehook.
Where theislands arecaught.
Theancient seas areconnected.
Thegreat birdAlae istaken,
The sister bird,
Ofthatoneofthehidderv fireofMaui."
Maui evidently hadnoscruples against using any-
thing which would helphimcarry out hisschemes.
Heindiscriminately robbed hisfriends andthegods
alike.
Down inthedeep seasank thehook with itsstrug-
gling bait, until itwas seized by"the landunder the
water."
ButHina themother sawthestruggle ofhersacred
birdandhastened totherescue. Shecaught awing
ofthe bird, butcould not pull thex\lae from the
sacred hook. Thewingwastorn ofif.Then the fish
27


gathered around thebaitandtore itinpieces. Ifthe
baitcould have been kept entire, then thelandwould
havecome upinacontinent rather than asanisland.
Then theHawaiian group would have been unbroken.
But thebaitbroke—and theislands came asfrag-
ments from theunder world.
Maui's hookandcanoe arefrequently mentioned in
thelegends. TheHawaiians have along rock in
theWailuku river atHilo which they callMaui's
canoe. Different names were given toMaui's canoe
bytheMaoris ofNew Zealand. "Vine ofHeaven,"
"Prepare fortheNorth," "Land oftheReceding Sea."
His fishhook bore thename "Plume ofBeauty."
Onthesouthern endofHawke's Bay,New Zealand,
there isacurved ledge ofrocks extending out fronii
thecoast. This isstill called bytheMaoris "Maui's
fish-hook," as ifthemagic hook hadbeen sofirmly
caught inthejaws oftheisland thatMaui could not
disentangle it,buthadbeen compelled tocut itoff
from liisline.
There isalarge stone ontheseacoast ofNorth
Kohala ontheisland ofHawaii which theHawaiians
point outasthe place where Maui's magic hook
caught theisland andpulled itthrough thesea.
IntheTonga Islands, aplaceknown asHounga is
pointed outbythe natives asthe spot wliere the
magic hook caught intherocks. Thehook itselfwas

formany generations.
Another group ofHawaiian legends, very incom-
plete, probably referring toMaui, butascribed to
other names, relates that afisherman caught alarge
block ofcoral. Hetook ittohispriest. After sacri-
ficing, andconsulting thegods, thepriest advised the
fisherman tothrow thecoral back into theseawith
incantations. While sodoing thisblock became Ha-
waii-loa. The fishing continued andblocks ofcoral
were caught andthrown back intotheseauntil allthe
islands appeared. Hints ofthislegend cling toother
island groups aswell astotheHawaiian Islands.
Fornander credits afisherman from foreign lands as
thus bringing forth theHawaiian Islands from the
deep seas. The reference occurs inpart ofachant
known asthat ofafriend ofPaao—thepriestwho is
supposed tohavecome fromiSamoa toHawaii inthe
eleventh century. This priest calls for hiscom-
panions :
"Here arethecanoes. Getaboard.
Come along, anddwell onHawaii with thegreen back.
Alandwhich wasfound intheocean,
Alandthrown upfrom thesea—
From thevery depths ofKanaloa,
Thewhite coral, inthewatery caves.
Thatwascaught onthehook ofthefisherman."
ThegodKanaloa issometimes known asaruler of
theunder-world, whose landwascaught byMaui's
29


hook andbrought upinislands. Thus inthelegends
thethought hasbeen perpetuated thatsome one of
theancestors ofthePolynesians made voyages and
discovered islands.
Inthetime ofUmi, King ofHawaii, there isthe
following record ofanimmense bone fish-hook, which
was called the"fish-hook ofMaui:"
"Inthenight ofMuku (the lastnight ofthemonth),
apriest and hisservants took aman, killed him,and
fastened hisbody tothehook, which bore thename
Manai-a-ka-lani, anddragged ittotheheiau (temple)
asa'fish,' andplaced itonthealtar."
Thishookwaskept until thetime ofKameham^cha
I.From time totime hetried tobreak it,andpulled
until heperspired.
Peapea, abrother ofKaahumanu, took thehook
andbroke it.Hewasafraid thatKamehameha would
killhim. Kaahumanu, however, soothed theKing,
andhepassed thematter over. Thebroken bonewas
probably thrown away.

III.
MAUI LIFTING THE SKY.
^1^+4-AUrS home was foralong timeenveloped by
*fdarkness. Theheavens had fallen down, or,^^^ rather, hadnotbeen separated from theearth.
According tosome legends, theskies pressed soclosely
andsoheavily upon theearth thatwhen theplants
began togrow, alltheleaves were necessarily flat.
According toother legends, theplants hadtopushup
theclouds alittle, and thus caused theleaves to
flatten outintolarger surface, sothatthey could bet-
terdrive theskiesbackandholdthem inplace. Thus
theleaves became flatatfirst,andhave soremained
through allthedays ofmankind. Theplants lifted the
skyinchbyinch untilmenwere able tocrawl about
between theheavens and theearth, andthus pass
from place toplace and visitoneanother.
After along time, according totheHawaiian
legends, aman,supposed tobeMaui, came toawoman
andsaid :"Give m.eadrink from your gourd cala-
31


bash, and Iwillpush theheavens higher." The
woman handed thegourd tohim.When hehadtaken
adeep draught, hebraced himself against theclouds
and lifted them totheheight ofthetrees. Again he
hoisted theskyandcarried ittothetops ofthemoun-
tains ;then with great exertion hethrust itupwards
once more, andpressed ittotheplace itnow occu-
pies. Nevertheless dark clouds many times hang low
along theeastern slope ofMaui's great mountain—
Haleakala—anddescend inheavy rains upon the hill
Kauwiki ;butthey dare notstay, lestMaui thestrong
come and hurlthem sofaraway that they cannot
come back again.
Amanwhohadbeenwatching theprocess oflift-
ingtheskyridiculed Maui forattempting such adiffi-
cult task.When theclouds rested onthetops ofthe
mountains, Maui turned topunish his critic. The
manhadikd totheother side oftheisland. Maui
rapidly pursued and finally caught himonthesea
coast, notmany miles north ofthetownnowknown
asLahaina. After abrief struggle themanwas
changed, according tothestory, into agreat black
rock, which canbeseenbyanytraveler who desires
tolocalize thelegends ofHawaii.
InSamoa Tiitii. thelatter part ofthe fullname of
Mauikiikii, isused asthename oftheonewhobraced
hisfeetagainst therocks andpushed theskyup.The
32


foot-prints, some sixfeet long, aresaid tobeshown
bythenatives.
Another Samoan story isalmost liketheHawaiian
legend. Theheavens had fallen, people crawled, but
theleaves pushed upalittle ;buttheskywasuneven.
Men tried towalk, buthittheir heads, and inthiscon-
fined space itwasvery hot.Awoman rewarded a
manwho lifted theskytoitsproper place bygiving
him adrink ofwater from hercocoanut shell.
Anumber ofsmall groups ofislands inthePacific
have legends oftheir skies being lifted, butthey at-
tribute thelabor tothegreat eelsandserpents of
thesea.
One oftheEllice group, Niu Island, says that as
theserpent began tolifttheskythepeople clapped
their hands and shouted "Lift up!" "High!"
"Higher!" Butthebody oftheserpent finally broke
into pieces which became islands, and theblood
sprinkled itsdrops ontheskyandbecame stars.
One oftheSamoan legends says thataplant called
daiga, which hadonelarge umibrella-like leaf,pushed
uptheskyandgave ititsshape.
TheVatupu, orTracey Islanders, said atonetime
theskyandrocks were united. Then steam orclouds
ofsmoke rosefrom therocks, and,pouring out in
volumes, forced theskyaway from theearth. Man
appeared inthese clouds ofsteam orsmoke. Perspira-
tionburst forth asthisman forced hiswaythrough
33


theheated atmosphere. From thisperspiration woman
was formed. Then were born three sons, two of
whom pushed upthesky. One, inthenorth, pushed
asfarashisarmswould reach. Theone inthesouth
wasshort andclimbed ahill,pushing ashewent up,
until theskywas initsproper place.
The Gilbert Islanders saytheskywaspushed up
bymenwith long poles.
The ancient New Zealanders understood incanta-
tionsbywhich they could draw upordiscover. They
found alandwhere theskyandtheearth were united.
They prayed over their stone axeandcuttheskyand
land apart. "Hau-hau-tu" wasthename ofthegreat
stone axebywhich thesinews ofthegreat heaven
above were severed, andLangi (sky) wasseparated
from'Papa (earth).
TheNew Zealand Maoris were accustomed tosay
that atfirst theskyrested close upon theearth and
therefore there was utter darkness forages. Then
thesixsons ofheaven and earth, born during this
period ofdarkness, felttheneed oflightanddiscussed
thenecessity ofseparating their parents—theskyfrom
theearth—anddecided toattempt thework.
Kongo (Hawaiian godLono) the"father offood
plants," attempted toliftthesky,butcould nottear
itfrom the earth. Then Tangaroa (Kanaloa), the
"father offishand reptiles," failed. Ilaumia Tiki-tiki
(Maui Kiikii), the"father ofwild food plants," could
34


notraise theclouds. ThenTu(Hawaiian Ku), the
"father offierce men," strug-gled invain. ButTane
(Hawaiian Kane), the"father ofgiant forests,"
pushed andHfted until hethrust theskyfarupabove
him. Then they discovered their descendants —the
multitude ofhuman beings whohadbeen living on
theearth concealed andcrushed bytheclouds. After-
wards the lastson,Tawhiri (father ofstorms), was
angry andwaged waragainst hisbrothers. Hehid
inthesheltered hollows ofthegreat skies. There he
begot hisvastbrood ofwinds andstorms withwhich
hefinally drove allhisbrothers andtheir descendants
intohiding places onlandand sea.TheNew Zea-
landers mention thenames ofthecanoes inwhich
their ancestors fledfrom theoldhome Hawaiki.
Tu(father offierce men) andhisdescendants, how-
ever, conquered wind andstorm andhave ever since
heldsupremacy.
TheNew Zealand legends alsosaythatheaven and
earth have never losttheir love foreach other. "The
warm sighs ofearth ever ascend from thewooded
mountains andvalleys, andmen callthem mists. The
skyalso lets fallfrequent tearswhich men termidew
drops."
TheManihiki islanders saythatMaui desired to
separate theskyfrom theearth. Hisfather, Ru,was
thesupporter oftheheavens. Maui persuaded him to
assist inlifting theburden. Maui went tothenorth
35


andcrept into aplace, where, lying prostrate under
thesky,hecould brace himself against itandpush
with great power. InthesamewayRuwent tothe
south andbraced himself against thesouthern skies.
Then theymade thesignal, andboth pressed "with
their backs against thesolid bluemass." Itgaveway
before thegreat strength ofthefather andson.Then
they lifted again, bracing themselves withhands and
knees against theearth. They crowded itandbent it
upward. They were able tostand with theskyresting
ontheir shoulders. They heaved against thebending
mass, and itreceded rapidly. They quickly putthe
palms oftheir hands under it ;then thetips oftheir
fingers, and itretreated farther and farther. Atlast,
"drawing themselves outtogigantic proportions, they
pushed theentire heavens uptothevery lofty position
which theyhave ever since occupied."
ButMaui andRuhad notworked perfectly to-
gether; therefore theskywastwisted and itssurface
wasvery irregular. They determined tosmooth the
skybefore they finished their task, sothey took large
stone adzes and chijjped offtherough protuberances
andridges, untilbyandbythegreat archwascutout
andsmoothed off.They then took finer tools and
chipped andpolished until theskybecame thebeau-
tifully finished bluedome which nowbends around
theearth.
TheIlervcy Island myth, asrelated byW.W. Gill,
36


states thatRu,thefather ofMaui, came frorm Avaiki
(Hawa-iki), theunderworld orabode ofthe spirits
ofthedead. Hefound mencrowded down bythe
sky,which wasamass ofsolid blue stone. Hewas
very sorrywhen hesawthecondition oftheinhabi-
tants oftheearth, andplanned toraise theskyalittle.
Soheplanted stakes ofdifferent kinds oftrees. These
were strong enough tohold theskysofarabove the
earth "thatmen could stand erect andwalk about
without inconvenience." Thiswascelebrated inone
oftheHervey Island songs:
"Force uptheheavens,
O,Eu!
And letthespace beclear."
For this helpful deedRureceived thename "The
supporter oftheheavens." Hewasrather proud of
hisachievement andwas gratified because ofthe
praise received. Sohecame sometimes andlooked at
thestakes andthebeautiful blueskyresting onthem,
Maui, theson,came along andridiculed hisfather for
thinking somuch ofhisw'ork. Maui isnotrepre-
sented, inthelegends, aspossessing agreat deal of
loveandreverence forhisrelatives provided hisaf-
fection interfered with hismischief; soitwasnotat
allstrange thathelaughed athisfather. Rubecame
angry andsaid toMaui :"Who toldyoungsters to
talk? Take care ofyourself, orIwill hurlyouout
ofexistence."
37


Maui dared him totry it.Ruquickly seized him
and"threw him toagreat height." But^lauichanged
himself toabirdandsank back toearth unharmed.
Then hechanged him«elf back into theform ofa
man, and,making himself very large, ranandthrust
hisheadbetween theoldman's legs.Hepried and
lifted untilRuandtheskyaround himbegan togive.
Another liftandhehurled them both tosuch aheight
that theskycould notcome back.
Ruhimself wasentangled among the stars. His
headandshoulders stuck fast,andhecould notfree
himself. How hestruggled, until theskies shook,
while Maui went away. Maui wasproud ofhis
achievement inhaving moved theskysofaraway.
Inthis self-rejoicing hequickly forgot hisfather.
Rudied after atime. "Hisbody rotted away and
hisbones, ofvast proportions, came tumbling down
from time totime,andwere shivered ontheearth into
countless fragments. These shattered bones ofRu
arescattered over every hillandvalley ofoneofthe
islands, totheveryedge ofthesea."
Thus thenatives oftheHervey Islands account for
themany pieces ofporous lavaandthesmall pieces
ofpumice stone found occasionally intheir islands.
The"bones" were very light andgreatly resembled
fragments ofrealbone. Ifthefragments were large
enough theyweresometimes taken andworshiped as
gods. One ofthese pieces, ofextraordinary size,was
38


given toMr. Gillwhen thenatives were bringing in
alarge collection ofidols. "This onewasknown as
'The Light Stone,' andwasworshiped asthegod of
thewind andthewaves. Upon occasions ofahurri-
cane, incantations and offerings offoodwould be
made toit."
Thus, according todifferent Polynesian legends,
Maui raised theskyandmade theearth inhabitable
forhisfellow-men.

IV.
MAUI SNARING THESUN.
"Maui became restless andfought thesun
With anoose that helaid.
And winter won thesun,
Andsummer waswonbyMaui."—Queen Liliuokalani's family chant.
AVERYunique legend isfound among the
widely-scattered Polynesians. The story of
Maui's "Snaring theSun" was toldamong
theMaoris ofNew Zealand, theKanakas oftheHer-
veyandSociety Islands, and theancient natives of
Hawaii. TheSamoans tellthesame story without
mentioning thename ofMaui. They saythat the
snare was castbyachild ofthesun itself.
ThePolynesian stories oftheorigin ofthesunare
worthy ofnote before thelegend ofthechange from
short tolong days isgiven.
TheTongan Islanders, according toW.W. Gill,
tellthestory oftheorigin ofthesunandmoon. They
40


saythatVatea (Wakea) and their ancestor Tongaiti
quarreled concerning achild—each claiming itashis
own. Inthestruggle thechildwascutintwo. Vatea
squeezed and rolled theparthesecured into aball
andthrew itaway, farupintotheheavens, where it
became thesun. Itshone brightly asitrolled along
theheavens, andsankdown toAvaiki (Hawaii), the
nether world. Buttheballcamie back again andonce
more rolled across thesky. Tonga-iti had lethishalf
ofthechild fallontheground and liethere, until
made envious bythebeautiful ballVatea made.
Atlasthetook thefleshwhich layontheground
andmade itintoaball.Asthesunsank hethrew
hisballupinto thedarkness, and itrolled along the
heavens, buttheblood haddrained outoftheflesh
while itlayupon theground, therefore itcould not
become soredandburning asthesun,andhadnot
lifetomove soswiftly. Itwas aswhite asadead
body, because itsblood was allgone ;and itcould not
make thedarkness fleeaway asthesunhaddone.
Thus dayandnight andthesunandmoon always
remain with theearth.
Thelegends oftheSociety Islands saythatademon
inthewestbecame angry with thesunand inhis
rage ate itup,causing night. Inthesameway a
demon from theeastwould devour themoon, butfor
some reason these angry ones could notdestroy their
captives andwere compelled toopen their mouths
41


and letthebright ballscome forth once more. In
some places asacrifice ofsome oneofdistinction was
needed toplacate thewrath ofthedevourers andfree
theballs oflight intimes ofeclipse.
Themoon, paleanddead inappearance, moved
slowly ;while thesun, fulloflifeandstrength, moved
quickly. Thus dayswere very short andnights were
very long. Mankind suffered from thefierceness of
theheat ofthesunandalsofrom itsprolonged ab-
sence. Dayandnight were alike aburden tomen.
Thedarkness was sogreat and lasted solong that
fruits would notripen.
After Maui hadsucceeded inthrowing theheavens
into their place, andfastening them sothattheycould
not fall,helearned thathehadopened away forthe
sun-god tocome upfrom thelower world andrapidly
runacross theblue vault. Thismade two troubles
formen—theheat ofthesunwasvery great andthe
journey tooquickly over. Maui planned tocapture
thesunandpunish him forthinking solittle about
thewelfare ofmankind.
AsRev. A.O.Forbes, amissionary among theHa-
waiians, relates, Maui's mother was troubled very
much bytheheedless haste ofthesun. Shehadmany
kapa-cloths tomake, forthiswas theonly kind of
clothing known inHawaii, except sometimes awoven
matoralong grass fringe worn asaskirt. This na-
tiveclothwasmade bypounding thefine liark ofcer-

tain trees withwooden mallets until thefibres were
beaten andground into awood pulp. Then she
pounded thepulp into thin sheets from which the
best sleeping mats and clothes could befashioned.
These kapa cloths had tobethoroughly dried, but
thedays were soshort thatbythetime shehad
spread outthekapa thesunhadheedlessly rushed
across theskyandgonedown into theunder-world,
and allthecloth had tobegathered upagain and
cared foruntil another dayshould come. There were
other troubles. "The food could notbeprepared and
cooked inoneday. Even anincantation tothegods
could notbechanted through eretheywere overtaken
bydarkness."
Thiswasvery discouraging andcaused great suf-
fering, aswell asmuch unnecessary trouble andlabor.
Many complaints weremade against thethoughtless
sun.
Maui pitied hismother anddetermined tomake the
sungoslower thatthedaysmight belongenough to
satisfy theneeds ofmen. Therefore, hewent over to
thenorthwest oftheisland onwhich helived. This
wasMt.lao,anextinct volcano, inwhich liesoneof
themost beautiful and picturesque valleys ofthe
Hawaiian Islands. Heclimbed theridges until he
could seethecourse ofthesunasitpassed over the
island. Hesaw that thesuncame uptheeastern
side ofMt.Haleakala. Hecrossed over theplain be-
43


tween thetwomountains andclimbed tothetopof
Mt.Haleakala. There hewatched theburning sun
as itcame upfrom Koolau andpassed directly over
thetopofthemountain. Thesummit ofHaleakala
isagreat extinct crater twenty miles incircumfer-
ence, andnearly twent^y-five hundred feet indepth.
There aretwotremendous gaps orchasms inthe
side ofthecrater wall, through which indaysgone
bythemassive bowl poured forth itsflowing lava.
One ofthesewastheKoolau, oreastern gap. inwhich
Maui probably planned tocatch thesun.
Mt.Hale-a-ka-la oftheHawaiian Islands means
House-of-the-sun. "La," or"Ra," isthename ofthe
sunthroughout parts ofPolynesia. Rawas thesun-
god ofancient Egypt. Thus theantiquities ofPoly-
nesia andEgypt touch each other, andtoday noman
knows the fullreason thereof.
TheHawaiian legend saysMaui wastaunted bya
manwho ridiculed theidea that hecould snare the
sun, saying, "You willnever catch thesun.You are
onlyanidlenobody."
Maui replied, "When Iconquer myenemy andmy
desire isattained, Iwillbeyour death."
After studying thepath ofthesun,Maui returned
tohismother and toldherthathewould goandcut
offthelegs ofthesunsothathecould notrunso
fast.
Hismother said: "Areyoustrong enough forthis
44


work?" Hesaid, "Yes." Then shegavehim fifteen
strands ofwell-twisted fiberandtoldhimtogotohis
grandmother, who lived inthegreat crater ofHale-
akala, fortherest ofthethings inhisconflict with
thesun. She said :"You must climb themountain
totheplace where alarge wiliwili tree isstanding.
There you will findtheplace where thesunstops to
eatcooked bananas prepared byyour grandmother.
Stay there until arooster crows three times ;then
watch your grandmother goouttomake afireand
putonfood. Youhad better take herbananas. She
willlook forthem and findyouandaskwhoyou are.
Tell heryoubelong toHina."
When shehadtaught him allthese things, hewent
upthemountain toKaupo totheplace Hina had di-
rected. There was alarge wiliwili tree. Here he
waited fortherooster tocrow. Thename ofthat
rooster wasKalauhele-moa. When therooster had
crowed three times, thegrandmother came outwith
abunch ofbananas tocook forthesun. Shetook off
theupper part ofthebunch and laid itdown. Maui
immediately snatched itaway. Inamoment she
turned topick itup,butcould notfind it.Shewas
angry andcried out:"Where arethebananas ofthe
sun?" Then shetook ofifanother part ofthebunch,
andMaui stole that. Thus hediduntil allthebunch
hadbeen taken away. Shewasalmost blind and
could notdetect himbysight, soshesniflfed allaround
45


heruntil shedetected thesmell ofaman. Sheasked:
"Who areyou? Towhom doyoubelong?" Maui
replied: "Ibelong toHina." "Why haveyoucome?"
Maui told her, "Ihavecome tokillthesun.Hegoes
sofastthathenever dries thetapaHina hasbeaten
out."
The oldwoman gave amagic stone forabattle axe
andonemore rope. Shetaught himhow tocatch the
sun,saying: "Make aplace tohideherebythislarge
wiliwili tree.When the firstlegofthesuncomes up,
catch itwithyour first rope, andsoonuntilyouhave
used allyour ropes. Fasten them tothe tree, then
take thestone axetostrike thebody ofthesun."
Maui dug aholeamong theroots ofthetreeand
concealed him'self. Soon the first rayoflight—the
first legofthesun—came upalong themountain side.
Maui threw hisropeandcaught it.Onebyonethe
legs ofthesuncame over theedge ofthecrater's rim
andwere caught. Only onelong legwas stillhang-
ingdown theside ofthemountain. Itwashard for
thesuntomove that leg. Itshook andtrembled and
tried hard tocome up.Atlast itcrept over theedge
andwascaught byMaui with therope given byhis
grandmother.
When thesunsaw that hissixteen long legswere
held fast intheropes, hebegan togobackdown the
mountain side intothesea.Then Maui tiedtheropes
fast tothetreeandpulled until thebody ofthesun
46


came upagain. Brave ^laui caught hismagic stone
club oraxe,andbegan tostrike andwound thesun,
until hecried: "Givememy life,"Maui said: "Ifyou
live,youmaybeatraitor. Perhaps Ihadbetter killyou."
Butthesunbegged for life. After theyhadconversed
awhile, they agreed that there should bearegular
motion inthejourney ofthesun. There should be
longer days, andyet half thetime hemight go
quickly asinthewinter time, buttheother halfhe
mustmove slowly asinsum^mer. Thusmendwelling
ontheearth should beblessed.
Another legend says that hemade alasso and
climbed tothesummit ofMt.Haleakala. Hemade
ready hislasso, sothatwhen thesuncame upthe
mountain sideandroseabove himhecould cast the
noose andcatch thesun,butheonly snared oneof
thesun's larger raysandbroke itoff.Again and
again hethrew thelasso until hehadbroken oflf all
thestrong rays ofthesun.
Then heshouted exultantly, "Thou artmycaptive;
Iwill killthee forgoing soswiftly."
Then thesun said,"Letmeliveandthou shalt see
megomore slowly hereafter. Behold, hastthou not
broken ofif allmystrong legsand leftmeonly the
weak ones?"
Sotheagreement wasmade, andMaui permitted
thesuntopursue hiscourse, andfrom thatdayhe
wentmore slowly.
47


Maui returned from, hisconflict with thesunand
sought for]\Ioemoe, themanwho liadriiHculed him.
Maui chased thismanaround theisland from one
side totheother until theyhadpassed through La-
haina (one ofthe first mission stations in1828).
There ontheseashore near thelarge black rock ofthe
legend ofMaui lifting theskyhefound Moemoe.
Then they lefttheseashore andthecontest raged up
hillanddown untilMaui slew themanand"changed
thebody into along rock,which isthere tothisday,
bytheside oftheroadgoing pastBlack Rock."
Before thebattle w'ith thesunoccurred Maui went
down intotheunderworld, according totheNew Zea-
land tradition, andremained alongtimewith hisrela-
tives. Insomewayhelearned that therewasanen-
chanted jawbone inthepossession ofsome oneofhis
ancestors, sohewaited andwaited, hoping that at
lasthemight discover it.
After atime henoticed thatpresents offoodwere
being sentaway tosome personwhom hehadnotmet.
Onedayheasked them^essengers, "Who isityou
aretaking thatpresent offood to?"
The people answered, "It isforMuri, your an-
cestress."
Then heasked forthefood, saying, "Iwillcarry
ittohermyself."
Buthetook thefoodaway andhid it."And this
48


hedidformany days," and thepresents failed to
reach theoldwoman.
Byandbyshesuspected mischief, for itdidnot
seem asifherfriends would neglect hersolong a
time, soshethought shewould catch thetricky one
andeathim. Shedepended upon hersense ofsmell
todetect theonewhohadtroubled her.AsSirGeorge
Grey tells thestory: "When Maui came along the
path carrying thepresent offood, theoldchiefess
sniffed and sniffed until shewassure thatshesmelt
some onecoming. Shewasverymuch exasperated,
andherstomach began todistend itself that she
might beready todevour thisonewhen hecame near.
Then sheturned toward thesouth andsniffed and
notascent ofanything reached her.Then sheturned
tothenorth, andtotheeast,butcould notdetect the
odor ofahuman being. Shemade onemore trialand
turned toward thewest.Ah !then camie thescent of
aman toherplainly andshecalled out, 'Iknow, from
thesmell wafted tomebythebreeze, thatsomebody
isclose tome.'"
Mauimadeknown hispresence andtheoldwoman
knew thathewas adescendant ofhers,andherstom-
achbegan immediately toshrink andcontract itself
again.
Then sheasked, "Art thouMaui?"
Heanswered, "Even so,"and told herthat he


wanted "thejaw-bone bywhich great enchantments
could bewrought."
Then Muri, theoldchiefess, gave him themagic
bone andhereturned tohisbrothers, whowere still
living ontheearth.
Then Maui said: "Let usnow catch thesun ina
noose thatwemaycompel him tomove more slowly
inorder thatmankind mayhave longdays tolabor in
andprocure subsistence forthemselves."
They replied, "Xomancanapproach itonaccount
ofthefierceness oftheheat."
According totheSociety Island legend, hismother
advised him tohave nothing todowith thesun,who
was adivine living creature, "inform like aman,
possessed offearful energy," shaking hisgolden locks
bothmorning andevening intheeyes ofmen.Many
persons had tried toregulate themovements ofthe
sun,buthad failed completely.
ButMaui encouraged hismother and hisbrothers
byasking them toremember hispower toprotect
himself bytheuseofenchantments.
TheHawaiian legend says thatMaui himself gath-
ered cocoanut fibre ingreat quantity andmanufac-
tured itintostrong ropes. Butthelegends ofother
islands saythat hehadtheaidofhisbrothers, and
while working learned many useful lessons. While
winding andtwisting they discovered how tomake
square ropes and flatropes aswell astheordinary
50


round rope. IntheSociety Islands, itissaid,Maui
and hisbrothers made sixstrong ropes ofgreat
length. These hecalled aeiariki (royal nooses).
TheNew Zealand legend says thatwhen Maui and
hisbrothers had finished making alltheropes re-
quired they took provisions andother things needed
andjourneyed toward theeast tofindtheplacewhere
thesunshould rise.Maui carried withhimthemagic
jaw-bone which hehadsecured from Muri, hisan-
cestress, intheunder-world.
They traveled allnight andconcealed themselves by
daysothatthesunshould notseethem andbecome
toosuspicious andwatchful. Inthisway they jour-
neyed, until "atlength theyhadgone very fartothe
eastward andhadcome totheveryedge oftheplace
outofwhich thesun rises. There they settowork
and builtoneach side along, high wall ofclay,with
huts ofboughs oftrees ateach end tohidethem-
selves in."
Here they laidalarge noose made from their ropes
andMaui concealed himself ononeside ofthisplace
along which thesunmust come, while hisbrothers
hidontheother side.
Maui seized hismagic enchanted jaw-bone asthe
weapon withwhich tofight thesun,andordered his
brothers topullhard onthenoose andnot tobe
frightened ormoved tosetthesun free.
"At lastthesuncame rising upoutofhisplace like
51


afirespreading farandwide over themountains and
forests.
Herises up.
Hishead passes through thenoose.
Theropes arepulled tight.
Then themonster began tostruggle and rollhim-
selfabout, while thesnare jerked backwards and for-
wards ashestruggled. Ah!wasnotheheld fast in
theropes ofhisenemies.
Then forth rushed that bold heroMaui with his
enchanted weapon. The sunscreamed aloud and
roared. Maui struck him fiercely withmany blows.
They heldhim foralong time. Atlastthey lethim
go,andthenweak fromwounds thesuncrept very
slowly andfeebly along hiscourse."
Inthisway thedaysweremade longer sothatmen
could perform their daily tasks and fruits andfood
plants could have time togrow.
The legend oftheHervey group ofislands says
thatMauimade sixsnares andplaced them atinter-
valsalong thepath overwhich thesunmust pass.
Thesun intheform ofamanclimbed upfromAva-
iki(Hawaiki). Maui pulled the first noose, but it
slipped down therising sun until itcaught andwas
pulled tight around hisfeet.
Maui ranquickly topull theropes ofthesecond
snare, butthat also slipped down, down, until itwas
tightened around theknees. Then Maui hastened to

thethird snare, while thesunwas trying torush
along onhisjourney. The third snare caught around
thehips. The fourth snare fastened itself around the
waist. The fifth slipped under thearms, andyetthe
sunsped along as ifbut little inconvenienced by
Maui's efforts.
Then Maui caught the lastnoose andthrew it
around theneck ofthesun,andfastened therope to
aspur ofrock. The sun struggled until nearly
strangled todeath andthengave up,promising Maui
thathewould goasslowly aswas desired. Maui left
thesnares fastened tothesun tokeephim incon-
stant fear.
"These ropesmay stillbeseenhanging from the
sun atdawn andstretching into theskieswhen he
descends into theocean atnight. Bytheassistance
ofthese ropes heisgently letdown intoAva-iki in
theevening, and also raised upoutofshadow-land in
themorning."
Another legend from theSociety Islands isrelated
byMr. Gill:
Maui triedmany snares before hecould catch the
sun.Thesunwas theHercules, ortheSamson, of
theheavens. Hebroke thestrong cords ofcocoanut
fibrewhich Mauimade andplaced around theopening
bywhich thesunclimbed outfrom theunder-world,
Maui made stronger ropes, but still thesunbroke
them every one.
53


Then Maui thought ofhissister's hair, thesister
Inaika, whom hecruelly treated inlater years. Her
hairwaslongand beautiful. Hecut offsome ofit
andmade astrong rope. With thishelassoed or
rather snared thesun,andcaught himaround the
throat. Thesunquickly promised tobemore thought-
fuloftheneeds ofmenandgoatamore reasonable
pace across thesky.
Astory from theAmerican Indians istold inHa-
waii's Young People, which isvery similar tothe
Polynesian legends.
AnIndian boybecame veryangry with thesunfor
getting sowarm andmaking hisclothes shrink with
theheat. Hetold hissister tomake asnare. The
girltooksinews from alarge deer, butthey shriveled
under theheat. Shetookherownlong hairandmade
snares, buttheywere burned inamoment. Then
shetried thefibres ofvarious plants andwassuccess-
ful.Her brother took the fibre cord anddrew it
through his lips. Itstretched andbecame astrong
redcord. Hepulled and itbecame very long. He
went totheplace ofsunrise, fixed hissnare, and
caught thesun.When thesunhadbeen sufficiently
punished, theanimals oftheearth studied theproblem
ofsetting thesun free. Atlastamouse aslarge asa
mountain ranandgnawed theredcord. Itbroke and
thesunmoved on,butthepoormouse hadbeen
54


burned and shriveled into thesmall mouse ofthe
present day.
ASamoan legend says that awoman living fora
time with thesunbore achildwhohadthename
"Child oftheSun." Shewanted gifts forthechild's
marriage, soshetook along vine,climbed atree,made
thevine into anoose, lassoed thesun,andmade him
giveherabasket ofblessings.
InFiji, thenatives tiethegrasses growing ona
hilltop overwhich they arepassing, when traveling
from place toplace. They dothistomake asnare to
catch thesun ifheshould trytogodown before they
reach theendoftheir day's journey.
This legend isamistymemory ofsome timewhen
thePolynesian people were incontact with theshort
days oftheextreme north orsouth. Itisavery re-
markable exposition ofafact ofnature perpetuated
many centuries inlands absolutely freefrom such
natural phenomena.

V.
MAUI FINDING FIRE.
"Grant, ohgrant methyhidden fire,
OBanj-an Tree.
Perform anincantation.
Utter aprayer
TotheBanyan Tree,
Kindle afire inthedust
OftheBanyan Tree."
—Translation ofancient Polynesian chant.
AMONGStudents ofmythology certain charac-
ters inthelegends ofthevarious nations are
known as"culture heroes." Mankind has
from time totime learned exceedingly useful lessons
andhasalso usually ascribed thenewknowledge to
some noted person inthenational mythology. These
mythical benefactors whohave brought these prac-
tical benefits tomen areplaced among the"hero-
gods." They have been teachers or"culture heroes"
tomankind.
56


Probably the firefinders ofthedifferent nations are
among thebestremembered ofallthese benefactors.
Thiswould naturally bethecase, fornogreater good
hastouched man's physical lifethan thediscovery of
methods ofmaking fire.
Prometheus, theclassical firefinder, ismost widely
known inliterature. But ofallthehelpful gods of
mythology, Maui, themischievous Polynesian, isbe-
yond question thehero ofthelargest numbers ofna-
tions scattered over thewidest extent ofterritory.
Prometheus belonged toRome, butMaui belonged to
thelength andbreadth ofthePacific Ocean. Theft
ortrickery, theuseofdeceit ofsome kind, isalmost
inseparably connected with firefinding allover the
world. Prometheus stole firefromi Jupiter andgave
ittomen together with thegenius tomake useofit
intheartsandsciences. Hefound therolling chariot
ofthesun, secretly filled hishollow staff with fire,
carried ittoearth, putapart inthebreast ofman to
create enthusiasm oranimation, andsaved the re-
mainder forthecomfort ofmankind tobeused with
theartist skill ofMinerva andVulcan. InBrittany
thegolden orfire-crested wren steals fireand isred-
marked while sodoing. Theanimals oftheNorth
American Indians arerepresented asstealing fire
sometimes from thecuttle fishandsometimes from
oneanother. Some swiftly-flying bird orfleet-footed
57


coyote would carry thestolen firetothehorn.e ofthe
tribe.
The possession offiremeant totheancients all
thatwealth means tothefamily oftoday. Itmeant
thei)ossession ofcomfort. Thegodswere naturally
determined tokeep thiswealth intheirown hands.
Foranyone tomake asharp dealandcheat agod
offireoutofapart ofthisvaluable property orto
make acourageous raid uj^on the fireguardian and
steal thetreasure, was easily sufficient tomake that
onea"culture hero." Asamatter offact aprehis-
toric family without firewould gotoanylength in
order toget it.The firefinders would naturally be
thehero-gods and stealing firewould beanexploit
rather than acrime.
Itisworth noting that inmany myths notonlywas
fire stolen, butbirds marked byredorblack spots
among their feathers were associated with the theft.
Itwould naturally besupposed that theHawaiians
living inavolcanic country with ever-flowing foun-
tains oflava,would connect their firemyths withsome
volcano when relating thestory oftheorigin offire.
But liketherest ofthePolynesians, they found fire
intrees rather than inrivers ofmelted rock. They
must have brought their firelegends and firecustoms
withthemwhen theycame totheislands ofactive
volcanoes.
Flint rocks asfireproducers arenotfound inthe
58


Hawaiian myths, nor inthestories from theisland
groups related totheHawaiians. Indians might see
thefleeing buffalo strike firefrom thestones under
hishard hoofs. The Tartars might have agod to
teach them "the secret ofthestone's edgeandthe
iron's hardness." The Peruvians could very easily
form alegend oftheir mythical father Guamansuri
finding away tomake fireafter hehadseen thesling
stones, thrown athisenemies, bring forth sparks of
firefrom therocks against which they struck. The
thunder and thelightning oflater years were the
sparks andthecrash ofstones hurled among thecloud
mountains bythemighty gods.
InAustralia thestory istold ofanoldmanandhis
daughter who lived ingreat darkness. After atime
thefather found thedoorway oflight through which
thesunpassed onhisjourney. Heopened thedoor
and aflood ofsunshine covered the earth. His
daughter looked around herhom^e andsawnumbers
ofserpents. She seized astaff andbegan tokill
them. Shewielded itsovigorously that itbecame hot
inherhands. Atlast itbroke, butthepieces rubbed
against each other andflashed intosparks andflames.
Thus itwaslearned that firewasburied inwood.
Flints wereknown inEurope andAsiaandAmer-
ica,butthePolynesian looked tothebanyan andkin-
dred trees forthehidden sparks offire.The natives
ofDePeyster's Island saythat their ancestors learned
59


how tomake firebyseeing smoke risefrom crossed
branches rubbing together while trees were shaken
byfierce winds.
Instudying theMaui myths ofthePacific itis
necessary toremember thatPolynesians use"t"and
"k"without distinguishing them apart, and also as
intheHawaiian Islands anapostrophe (') isoften
used inplace of"t"or"k". Therefore theMaui
Ki-i-k-i'i ofHawaii becomes thedemi-god Tiki-tiki of
theGilbert Islands—orthe Ti'i-ti'i ofSamoa orthe
Tiki ofNew Zealand—orother islands ofthegreat
ocean.Wemust alsoremember that intheHawaiian
legends Kalana isMaui's father. This inother groups
becomes Talanga orKalanga orKaranga. Kanaloa,
thegreat godofmost ofthedifferent Polynesians, is
alsosom^etimes called theFather ofMaui. Itisnot
strange thatsome oftheexploits usually ascribed to
Maui should beinsome places transferred tohis
father under onename ortheother. Ononeortwo
groups Mafuia, anancestress ofMaui, ismentioned
asfinding the fire.Theusual legend makes Maui the
onewho takes fireaway from Mafuia. The story of
firefinding inPolynesia sifts itself toMaui under one
ofhiswidely-accepted names, ortohisfather orto
hisancestress—with butvery fewexceptions. This
fact isimportant asshowing inaverymarked man-
nertherace relationship ofavastnumber ofthe
islanders ofthePacific world. From theMarshall
60


Islands, inthewest, totheSociety Islands ofthe
east; from theHawaiian Islands inthenorth tothe
New Zealand group inthesouth, thefootsteps of
Maui the firefinder canbetraced.
TheHawaiian story offirefinding isone ofthe
least marvelous ofallthelegends. Hina, Maui's
mother, wanted fish.Onemorning early Maui saw
thatthegreat storm waves oftheseahaddieddown
andthefishing grounds could beeasily reached. He
awakened hisbrothers andwiththem hastened tothe
beach. Thiswas atKaupo ontheisland ofMaui.
Out intothegrayshadows ofthedawn they paddled.
When theywere farfrom shore theybegan tofish.
ButMaui, looking landward, sawafireonthemoun-
tain side.
"Behold," hecried. "There isafireburning. Whose
can this firebe?"
"Whose, indeed?" hisbrothers replied.
"Let ushasten totheshore andcook ourfood,"
said one.
They decided thattheyhadbetter catch some fishto
cook before they returned. Thus, inthemorning, be-
forethehotsundrove thefishdeepdown tothedark
recesses ofthesea,they fished until abountiful sup-
plylayinthebottom ofthecanoe.
When theycame toland,Maui leaped outandran
upthemountain sidetogetthe fire.Foralong, long
time theyhadbeen without fire.The great volcano
61


Haleakala above them hadbecome extinct—andthey
had lostthecoals theyhad tried tokeep alive. They
hadeaten fruits anduncooked roots andtheshell fish
broken from thereef—andsometimes thegreat raw
fishfrom thefar-out ocean. Butnow theyhoped to
gain living fireandcooked food.
Butwhen Maui rushed uptoward thecloudy pillar
ofsmoke hesawafamily ofbirds scratching the fire
out. Their work was finished andthey flewaway
just ashereached theplace.
Maui and hisbrothers watched for fireday after
day—butthebirds, thecurly-tailed Alae (orthemud-
hens) made nofire. Finally thebrothers went fishing
oncemore—butwhen they looked toward themoun-
tain, again theysawflames andsmoke. Thus ithap-
pened tothem again andagain.
Maui proposed tohisbrothers thattheygofishing
leaving him towatch thebirds. ButtheAlaecounted
thefishermen andrefused tobuild afireforthehidden
onewhowaswatching them. They saidamong them-
selves, "Three areintheboatandweknow notwhere
theother one is,wewillmake nofiretoday."
Sotheexperiment failed again andagain. Ifone
ortworemained or ifallwaited ontheland there
would benofire—butthedawn which saw thefour
brothers intheboat,saw also the fireontheland.
Finally Maui rolled some kapa cloth together and
stuck itupinoneendofthecanoe sothat itwould
62


look likeaman.Hethen concealed himself near the
haunt ofthemud-hens, while hisbrothers went out
fishing. The birds counted thefigures intheboat
andthen started tobuild aheap ofwood forthe fire.
Maui wasimpatient—andjust astheoldAlae be-
gan toselect sticks withwhich tomake theflames
heleaped swiftly outandcaught herandheld her
prisoner. Heforgot foramoment thathewanted
thesecret offiremaking. Inhisanger against the
wise bird hisfirstimpulse wastotaunt herandthen
killherforhiding thesecret offire.
ButtheAlae cried out: "Ifyouarethedeath of
me—mysecret willperish also—andyoucannot have
fire."
Maui thenpromised tospare her life ifshewould
tellhimwhat todo.
Then came thecontest ofwits. The bird toldthe
demi-god torubthestalks ofwater plants together.
Heguarded thebirdand tried theplants. Water in-
stead offireranoutofthetwisted stems. Then she
toldhim torubreeds together—butthey bentand
broke andcould make nofire.Hetwisted herneck
until shewas halfdead—then shecried out: "Ihave
hidden the fireinagreen stick."
]\Iauiworked hard, butnotaspark offireappeared.
Again hecaught hisprisoner bytheheadandwrung
herneck, andshenamed akind ofdrywood. Maui
rubbed the sticks together, butthey onlybecame
63


warm. The neck twisting process wasresumed—
andrepeated again andagain, until themud-hen was
almost dead—andMaui had tried tree after tree. At
lastMaui found fire.Then astheflames rosehesaid:
"There isonemore thing torub." Hetook afire
stick andrubbed thetopofthehead ofhisprisoner
until thefeathers felloffandtheraw flesh appeared.
Thus theHawaiian mud-hen and herdescendants
have ever since hadbald heads, andtheHawaiians
havehadthesecret offiremaking.
Another Hawaiian legend places thescene of
Maui's contest with themud-hens alittle inland of
thetown ofHiloontheIsland ofHawaii. There are
three small extinct craters very neareach otherknown
asTheHalae Hills. One, thesouthern orPuna side
ofthe hills, isaplace called Pohaku-nui. Here dwelt
two brother birds oftheAlae family. They were
gods. Onehadthepower offiremaking. Here at
Pohaku-nui theywereaccustomed tokindle afireand
bake their dearly loved food—baked bananas. Here
Maui planned tolearn thesecret offire.The birds
hadkindled the fireand thebananas were almost
done, when theelder Alae called totheyounger:
"Be quick, herecomes theswift sonofHina."
Thebirds scratched outthe fire,caught thebananas
and fled.Maui told hismother hewould follow them
until helearned thesecret offire. Hismother en-
couraged himbecause hewasvery strong andvery


swift. Sohefollowed thebirds from place toplace
asthey fledfrom him, finding new spots onwhich
tomake their fires. Atlasttheycame toWaianae on
theisland Oahu. There hesaw agreat fireand a
multitude ofbirds gathered around it,chattering
loudly andtrying tohasten thebaking ofthebananas.
Their incantation was this: "Let uscook quick."
"Let uscook quick." "The swift child ofHina wall
come."
Maui's mother Hina hadtaught himhow toknow
thefire-maker. "Ifyougouptothe fire,you will
findmany birds. Only one istheguardian. This is
thesmall, young Alae. Hisname isAlae-iki: Only
thisoneknows how tomake fire." Sowhenever
Maui came near tothefire-makers healways sought
forthe little Alae. Sometim-es hemade mistakes and
sometimes almost captured theonehedesired. At
Waianae heleaped suddenly among thebirds. They
scattered the fire, and theyounger bird tried
tosnatch hisbanana from the coals and flee,
butMaui seized him andbegan totwist his
neck. The bird cried out,warning Maui not to
killhimorhewould losethesecret offirealtogether.
Maui was told that the firewasmade from abanana
stump. Hesaw thebananas roasting andthought
thiswas reasonable. So,according todirections, he
began torubtogether pieces ofthebanana. The bird
hoped foranunguarded moment when hemight es-
65


cape, butMaui wasvery watchful andwas alsovery
angry when hefound thatrubbing only resulted in
squeezing outjuice. Then hetwisted theneck ofthe
birdandwas told torubthestem ofthetaro plant.
This alsowassogreen that itonlyproduced water.
Then hewassoangry thathenearly rubbed thehead
ofthebird off—andthebird, fearing for its life, told
thetruth andtaught Mauihow tofind thewood in
which firedwelt.
They learned todraw outthesparks secreted in
different kinds oftrees. Thesweet sandalwood was
oneofthese firetrees. ItsHawaiian name is"Hiahi"—the "ili" (bark) and"ahi" (fire), thebark inwhich
fire isconcealed.
Alegend oftheSociety Islands issomewhat similar.
Ina(Hina) promised toaidMaui infinding firefor
theislanders. Shesenthim into theunder-world to
findTangaroa (Kanaloa). This godTangaroa held
fire inhispossession—Maui was toknow himbyhis
tattooed face. Down thedark path through thelong
caves Maui trod swiftly until hefound thegod.Maui
asked him for firetotakeuptomen. Thegodgave
him alighted stick andsenthimaway. ButMaui
putthe fireoutandwent back again after fire. This
hedidseveral times, until thewearied giver decided
toteach theintruder theartoffiremaking. Hecalled
awhite duck toaidhim. Then, taking two sticks of
drywood, hegave theunder one tothebirdand
66


rapidly moved theupper stick across theunder until
firecame. Maui seized theupper stick, after ithad
been charred intheflame, andburned thehead ofthe
birdback ofeach eye.Thus weremade theblack
spots which mark thehead ofthewhite duck. Then
arose aquarrel between Tangaroa andMaui—but
Maui struck down thegod, and,thinking hehadkilled
him, carried away theartofmaking fire. Hisfather
andmother made inquiries about their relative—Maui
hastened back tothe fire fountain andmade the
spirit return tothebody—then, coming back toIna,
hebade hergood byeand carried the firesticks to
theupper-world. TheHawaiians, andprobably others
among thePolynesians, feltthatany state ofuncon-
sciousness was aform ofdeath inwhich the spirit
leftthebody, butwas called backbyprayers and in-
cantations. Therefore, when Maui restored thegod
toconsciousness, hewassupposed tohavemade the
spirit released bydeath return into thebody and
bring itback tolife.
IntheSamoan legends asrelated byG.Turner,
thename Ti'iti'i isused. This isthesame asthe
second name found inMaui Ki'i-ki'i. TheSamoan
legend ofTi'iti'i isalmost identical with theNew
Zealand firemyth ofMaui, and isvery similar tothe
story coming from theHervey Islands from Savage
Island and alsofrom theTokelau andother island
groups. TheSamoan story says that thehome of
67


Mafuie theearthquake godwas intheland ofper-
petual fire. Maui's orTi'iti'i's father Talanga (Ka-
lana) was also aresident oftheunder-world and a
great friend oftheearthquake god.
Ti'iti'i watched hisfather ashelefthishome inthe
upper-world. Talanga approached aperpendicular
wall ofrock, saidsome prayer orincantation —and
passed through adoorwhich immediately closed after
him. (This isavery near approach tothe"open
sesame" oftheArabian Nights stories.)
Ti'iti'i went totherock, butcould notfindtheway
through. Hedetermined toconceal himself thenext
time sonear thathecould hear hisfather's words.
After some days hewasable tocatch allthewords
uttered byhisfather asheknocked onthestone
door—
"Orock! divide.
IamTalanga,
Icome towork
Onmyland
Given byMafuie."
Ti'iti'i went totheperpendicular wallandimitating
hisfather's voice called forarock toopen. Down
through acave hej^assed until hefound hisfather
working intheunder-world.
Theastonished father, learning how hissoncame,
badehimkeep very cpiict andwork lesthearouse the
68


anger ofMafuie. Soforatime theboy labored
obediently byhisfather's side.
Inalittle while theboysawsmoke andasked what
itwas. The father toldhim that itwas thesmoke
from the fire ofMafuie, and explained what lire
would do.
Theboydetermined togetsome fire—hewent to
theplace fromwhich thesmoke arose andthere found
thegod,andasked him for fire.Mafuie gavehim fire
tocarry tohisfather. Theboyquickly hadanoven
prepared andthe fireplaced inittocooksome ofthe
taro theyhadbeen cultivating. Just aseverything
wasready anearthquake godcame upandblew the
fireoutandscattered thestones oftheoven.
Then Ti'iti'i wasangry andbegan totalk toMa-
fuie.Thegodattacked theboy, intending topunish
himseverely fordaring torebel against thedestruc-
tion ofthe fire.
What abattle there was foratime intheunder-
world !Atlast Ti'iti'i seized oneofthearms ofMa-
fuieandbroke itoff.Hecaught theother armand
began totwist andbend it.
Mafuie begged theboy tospare him. Hisrightarm
wasgone.How could hegovern theearthquakes if
his leftarmwere torn offalso? Itwas hisduty to
holdSamoa level andnotpermit toomany earth-
quakes. Itwould behard todothatevenwithone
69


arm—but itwould beimpossible ifbotharms were
gone.
Ti'iti'i listened tothepleaanddemanded areward
ifheshould spare theleftarm. Mafuie offered Ti'iti'i
onehundred wives. Theboydidnotwant them.
Then thegodoffered toteach himthesecret offire
finding totake totheupper-world.
Theboyagreed toaccept the firesecret, andthus
learned that thegods inmaking theearth hadcon-
cealed fire invarious trees formen todiscover in
theirown good time, and that this firecould be
brought outbyrubbing pieces ofwood together.
The people ofSamoa have nothadmuch faith in
Mafuie's plea thatheneeded hisleftarm inorder to
keepSamoa level. They saythatMafuie hasalong
stick orhandle totheworld under theislands—and
when heisangry orwishes tofrighten them hemoves
thishandle and easily shakes theislands. When an
earthquake comes, they give thanks toTi'iti'i for
breaking offonearm—because ifthegodhadtwo
arms they believe hewould shake them unmercifully.
Onelegend oftheIlervey Islands says thatMaui
and hisbrothers hadbeen living onuncooked food—
butlearned that theirmother sometim^es haddelicious
foodwhich hadbeen cooked. They learned also that
firewasneeded inorder tocook their food. Then
Maui wanted fireandwatched hismother.
Maui's mother was theguardian oftheway tothe
70


invisible world. When shedesired topassfrom her
home totheother world, shewould open ablack rock
andpass inside. Thus shewent toHawaiki, the
under-world. Maui planned tofollow her,but first
studied theforms ofbirds thathemight assume the
body ofthestrongest andmost enduring. After a
time hetook theshape ofapigeon and, flying tothe
black rock, passed through thedoorandflewdown
thelongdark passage-way.
After atime hefound thegod offireliving ina
bunch ofbanyan sticks. Hechanged himself intothe
form ofamananddemanded thesecret offire.
The firegodagreed togiveMaui fire ifhewould
permit himself tobetossed intotheskybythegod's
strong arms.
Maui agreed oncondition thatheshould have the
right totoss the firegodafterwards.
The fire-god feltcertain that there would beonly
oneexercise ofstrength—hefeltthathehadevery-
thing inhisownhands—soreadily agreed tothetoss-
ingcontest. Itwas hisintention tothrow hisoppo-
nent sohigh thatwhen he fell, ifheever did fall,
there would benoantagonist uncrushed.
Heseized Maui inhisstrong arm-s and,swinging
himbackand forth, flung himupward—butthemo-
mentMaui lefthishands hechanged himself into a
feather andfloated softly totheground.
Then theboyranswiftly tothegodandseized him
71


bythelegsand lifted him up.Then hebegan toin-
crease insizeandstrength until hehad lifted the fire
godvery high. Suddenly hetossed thegodupward
andcaught him ashefell—again andagain—until
thebruised anddizzy godcried enough, andagreed to
give thevictor whatever hedemanded.
Maui asked forthesecret offireproducing. The
godtaught himhow torubthedrysticks ofcertain
kinds oftrees together, and,byfriction, produce fire,
andespecially how firecould beproduced byrubbing
firesticks inthefinedust ofthebanyan tree.
ASociety Island legend saysMaui borrowed asa-
cred redpigeon, belonging toone ofthegods, and,
changing himself into adragon fly,rode thispigeon
through ablack rock intoAvaiki (Hawaiki), the fire-
land oftheunder-world. Hefound thegod offire,
Mau-ika, living inahouse built from abanyan tree.
Mau-ika taught Maui thekinds ofwood intowhich
when firewent outontheearth afiregoddess had
thrown sparks inorder topreserve fire.Among these
were the"au" (Hawaiian hau), or"thelemon hibis-
cus"—the"argenta," the"fig" andthe"banyan." She
taught him alsohow tomake firebyswift motion
when rubbing thesticks ofthese trees. Shealsogave
himcoals forhispresent need.
ButMaui was viciously mischievous and setthe
banyan house on fire,thenmounted hispigeon and
fledtoward theupper-world. Buttheflames hastened


afterhimandburst outthrough therock doors into
thesunlit landabove—asifitwere avolcanic erup-
tion.
TheTokelau Islanders saythatTalanga (Kalana)
known inother groups ofislands asthefather of
Maui, desired fire inorder tosecure warmth and
cooked food. Hewent down, down, very fardown
inthecaves oftheearth. Inthelower world hefound
Mafuika—anoldblindwoman, whowastheguardian
offire.Hetoldherhewanted firetotakeback to
men. Sherefused either togive fireortoteachhow to
make it.Talanga threatened tokillher,and finally
persuaded hertoteachhow tomake fireinanyplace
hemight dwell—andtheproper trees touse,the fire-
yielding trees. Shealsotaught himhow tocook food—and also thekind offishheshould cook, andthe
kinds which should beeaten raw. Thus mankind
learned about food aswell asfire.
TheSavage Island legend adds theelement ofdan-
gertoMaui's mischievous theft offire.The lad fol-
lowed hisfather onedayandsawhim pullupabunch
ofreeds andgodown intothefire-land beneath. Maui
hastened down toseewhat hisfather was doing.
Soon hesav/ hisoportunity tosteal thesecret offire.
Then hecaught some fireandstarted fortheupper-
world.
Hisfather caught aglimpse oftheyoung thiefand
tried tostophim.
n


Maui ranupthepassage through theblack cave—
bushes and trees bordered hisroad.
The father hastened after hissonandwasahnost
ready tolayhands upon him,when Maui set fireto
thebushes. The flames spread rapidly, catching the
underbrush andthetreesonallsidesandburst outin
theface ofthepursuer. Destruction threatened the
under-world, butMaui spedalong hisway. Then he
saw that the firewaschasing hirm. Bush after bush
leaped intoflame andhurled sparks andsmoke and
burning airafter him.Choked andsmoke-surrounded,
hebroke through thedoor ofthecavern andfound
thefresh airoftheworld. But theflames followed
himandswept out ingreat power upon theupper-
world amighty volcanic eruption.
TheNew Zealand legends jiicture Maui asputting
out, inone night, allthe fires ofhispeople. This
wasserious mischief, andMaui's mother decided that
heshould gototheunder-world andseehisancestress,
JMahuika, theguardian offire,andgetnew firetore-
pair theinjury hehadwrought. Shewarned him
against attempting toplay tricks upon theinhabitants
ofthelower regions.
Maui gladly hastened down thecave-path tothe
house r)fMahuika, andasked for firefortheupper-
world. Insomewayhepleased hersothatshepulled
offafinger nail inwhich firewasburning andgave
ittohim. Assoon ashehadgone back toaplace

where there was water, heputthe fireoutand re-
turned toMahuika, asking another gift,which hede-
stroyed. This hedidforboth hands and feet until
only one nailremained. Maui wanted this.Then
Mahuika became angry andthrew thelastfinger nail
ontheground. Firepoured outand laidhold of
everything. Maui ranupthepath totheupper-world,
butthe firewas swifter-footed. Then Maui changed
himself intoaneagle andflewhighupinto the air,
butthe fireandsmoke stillfollowed him.Then he
sawwater anddashed into it,but itwas toohot.
Around himtheforests were blazing, theearth burn-
ingandtheseaboiling. Maui, about toperish, called
onthegods forrain. Then floods ofwater felland
the firewaschecked. Thegreat rain fellonMahuika
findshe fled,almost drowned. Her stores offirewere
destroyed, quenched bythestorm. But inorder to
save firefortheuseofmen, asshe fledshethrew
sparks into different kinds oftrees where therain
could notreach them', sothatwhen firewasneeded
itmight bebrought intotheworld again byrubbing
together the fire sticks.
TheChatham Islanders give thefollowing incanta-
tion,which they saidwasusedbyMaui against the
fierce flood offirewhich waspursuing him:
75


"To theroaring thunder;
Tothegreat rain—thelong rain;
Tothedrizzling rain—thesmall rain;
Totherain pattering ontheleaves.
These arcthestorms—thestorms
Cause them tofall;
Topour intorrents."
The legend ofSavage Island places Maui inthe
role offire-maker. Hehasstolen fire intheunder-
world. Hisfather tries tocatch him, butMaui sets
firetothebushes bythepath until agreat conflagra-
tion israging which pursues him totheupper-world.
Some legends make Maui thefirc-tcacher aswell
asthefire-finder. Heteaches menhow tousehard-
wood sticks inthefinedrydustonthebark ofcer-
tain trees, orhow tousethe fine fibre ofthepalm
tree tocatch sparks.
InTahiti the firegodlived inthe"Hale-a-o-a," or
House oftheBanyan. Sometimes human sacrifices
were placed upon thesacred branches ofthis tree of
the firegod.
IntheBowditch orFakaofa Islands thegoddess of
firewhen conquered taught notonly themethod of
making firebyfriction butalsowhat fishwere tobe
cooked andwhat were tobeeaten raw.

VI.
MAUITHESKILLFUL.
ACCORDINGtotheNew Zealand legends there
were six^lauis—theHawaiians counted four.
They were aband ofbrothers. Theolder five
wereknown as"the forgetful Mauis." The tricky
andquick-witted youngest member ofthefamily was
called Maui teatamai—"Alaui theskillful."
Hewascuriously accounted forintheNewZealand
under-world. When hewentdown through thelong
cave tohisancestor's home tofind fire,hew^assoon
talked about. "Perhaps this isthemanaboutwhom
somuch issaid intheupper-world." Hisancestress
fromwhom heobtained firerecognized him asthe
man called "the deceitful Maui." Even hisparents
toldhimonce,"Weknow you arcatricky fellow—
more sothananyother man." One oftheNew Zea-
land firelegends while recording his flight tothe
under-world and hisappearance asabird, says:"The
men tried tosjicar him,and tocatch him innets. At
78


lastthey cried out,'Maybe you arethemanwhose
fame isgreat intheupper-world.' Atonce heleaped
totheground andappeared intheform ofaman."
Hewasnotfamous forinventions, buthewas al-
ways ready toimprove upon anything which was al-
ready inexistence. Hecould take thesun inhand
andmake itdobetter work. Hecould tiethemoon
sothat ithadtoswim backaround theisland tothe
place intheocean fromwhich itmight riseagain, and
goslowly through thenight.
Hisbrothers invented aslender, straight andsmooth
spear withwhich tokillbirds. Hesawthefluttering,
struggling birds twist themselves ofifthesmooth point
andescape. Hemade agood light bird spear andput
notches initandkeptmost ofthebirds stuck. His
brothers finally examined hisspear andlearned the
reason for itssuperiority. Inthesameway they
learned how tospear fish.They could strike and
wound andsom^etimes kill—butthey could notwith
theirsmooth spears draw thefishfrom thewaters of
thecoral caves. ButMaui theyoungest made barbs,
sothat the fishcould not easily shake themselves
loose. The others soonmade their spears like his.
Thebrothers were said tohave invented baskets in
which totrap eels,butmany eelsescaped. Maui im-
proved thebasket bysecretly making aninside parti-
tion aswell asacover, andtheeelswere securely
trapped. Ittook thebrothers along time tolearn
79


therealdilYercnce between their baskets and his.One
ofthefamily made abasket likehisandcaught many-
eels.Then Maui became angry andchanted acurse
overhimandbewildered him, thenchanged him into
adog.
TheManahiki Islanders have thelegend thatAlaui
made themoon, butcould notgetgood lightfrom it.
Hetried experiments andfound that thesunwas quite
animprovement. The sun's example stimulated the
moon toshine brighter.
OnceMauibecame interested intattooing and tried
tomake adog look better byplacing dark lines
around themouth. Thelegends saythatoneofthe
sacred birdssawthepattern andthenmarked thesky
with theredlinessometimes seen atsunrise andsun-
set.AnHawaiian legend says thatMaui tattooed his
armwith asacred name andthus thatarmwasstrong
enough tohold thesunwhen helassoed it.There is
aNew Zealand legend inwhich Maui ismade oneof
three godswho firstcreated manandthenwoman from
oneoftheman's ribs.
TheHawaiians dwelling inIlilohavemany stories
ofMaui. They saythat hishome wasonthenorth-
ernbank oftheWailuku River. Hehad astrong
staffmade from- anohia tree (the native apple tree).
With thishepunched holes through thelava,making
natural bridges andboiling pools, andnewchannels
foritssometimes obstructed waters, sothatthej)eo[)le
80


could goupordown therivermore easily. Near one
ofthenatural bridges isafigure ofthemoon carved
intherocks, referred bysome ofthenatives toMaui.
Maui issaid tohave taught hisbrothers thediffer-
entkinds offishnetsandtheuseofthestrong fibre
oftheolona, which wasmuch better than cocoanut
threads.
TheNew Zealand stories relate thespear-throwing
contests ofMaui and hisbrothers. Aschildren, how-
ever, theywere notallowed theuseofwooden spears.
They took thestems oflong, heavy reeds andthrew
them ateach other, butMaui's reeds were charmed
intostronger andharder fibre sothathebroke his
mother's house andmade herrecognize him asone
ofherchildren. Hehadbeen taken away assoon
ashewasbornbythegods towhom hewas related.
When hefound hiswaybackhome hismother paid
noattention tohim.Thusbyaspear thrust hewon a
hom^e.
The brothers allmade fishhooks, butMaui the
youngest made two kinds ofhooks—one like his
brothers' andonewith asharp barb. Hisbrothers'
hooks were smooth sothat itwas difficult tokeep
thefishfrom floundering andshaking themselves ofif,
butthey noticed that the fishwere heldbyMaui's
hook better thanbytheirs. Mauiwasnotinclined to
devote himself tohardwork, andlivedonhisbrothers
asmuch aspossible—butwhen driven outbyhis
81


wife orhismotlier hewould catch more fishthan the
other fishermen. They tried loexamine hishooks,
buthealways changed hishooks sothatthey could
notseeany difference between hisand theirs. At
such times they called him themischievous oneand
tried toleave himbehind while theywent fishing.
They were, however, always ready togivehim credit
forhisimprovements. They dealt generously with
himwhen they learned what hehad really accom<-
plished. When theycaught himwith hisbarbed hook
they forgot thepastandcalled him"kcatamai"—the
skillful.
The idea that fishhooks made from thejawbones
ofhuman beings were better than others, seemed to
have arisen atfirstfrom theangle formed inthelower
jaw-bone. Later thesehuman fishhooks were con-
sidered sacred and therefore possessed ofmagic
powers. The greater sanctity andpower belonged to
thebones which boremore especial relation tothe
owner. Therefore Maui's "magic hook." w^ithwhich
hefished upislands, wasmade from thejawbone of
hisancestress Mahuika. Itisalso said that inorder
tohave powerful hooks forevery-day fishing hekilled
two ofhischildren. Their right eyes hethrew up
intotheskytobecome stars. Onebecame themorn-
ingandtheother theevening star.
The idea that the death ofanymembers of
thefamily must notstand intheway ofobtaining
82


magical power, hasprevailed throughout Polynesia.
From thisangle inthejawbone Maui must have
conceived theidea ofmaking ahook with apiece of
bone orshellwhich should befastened tothelarge
bone atavery sharp angle, thusmaking akind of
barb. Hooks likethishavebeenmade foragesamong
thePolynesians.
Maui and hisbrothers went fishing foreelswith
baitstrung ontheflexible ribofacocoanut leaf.The
stupid brothers didnotfasten theends ofthestring.
Therefore theeels easily slipped thebait offand es-
caped. ButMauimade theends ofhisstring fast,
andcaptured many eels.
The little things which others didnotthink about
were thefoundation ofMaui's fame. Upon these little
things hebuilt hiscourage tosnare thesunandseek
fireformankind.
InaNew Zealand legend, quoted byEdward Tre-
gear, Maui iscalled Maui-maka-walu, or"Maui with
eyes eight." This eight-eyed Maui would beallied to
theHindoo deities whowith their eight eyes facethe
four quarters ofthev/orld—thus possessing both in-
sight into theaffairs ofmenand foresight into the
future.
Fornander, theHawaiian ethnologist, says :'Tn
Hawaiian mythology, Kamapuaa, thedemigod oppo-
nent ofthegoddess Pele, isdescribed ashaving eight
eyesandeight feet ;and inthelegends Maka-walu,
83


'eight-eyed,' isafrequent epithet ofgodsand chiefs."
Henotes thiscoincidence with theappearance ofsome
oftheprincipal Hindoo deities ashaving som^e bear-
ingupon theorigin ofthePolynesians. Itmay be
that acomj^arative study ofthelegends ofother
islands ofthePacific bysome student willopen up
othernewandimportant facts.
InTahiti, ontheisland Raiatea, ahigh priest or
prophet lived inthelong, long ago.Hewasknown
asMaui theprophet ofTahiti. Hewasprobably not
Maui thedemigod. Nevertheless hewasrepresented
aspossessing very strange prophetical powers.
According tothehistorian Ellis,who previous to
1830 spent eight years intheSociety andHawaiian
Islands, this prophet Maui clearly prophesied the
coming ofanoutriggerless canoe fromsome foreign
land. Anoutrigger isalogwhich sobalances a
canoe that itcanride safely through thetreacherous
surf.
The chiefs andprophets charged himwith stating
theimpossible.
Hetook hiswooden calabash and ])lace(l itina
pool ofwater asanillustration ofthewaysuch a
boatshould float.
Then with thefloating bowl before himheuttered
thesecond prophecy, thatboats without linetotiethe
sails tothemasts, orthemasts totheships, should
alsocome toTahiti.

When English ships under Captain Wallis andCap-
tainCook, inthelatter part oftheeighteenth century,
visited these islands, thenatives cried out,"Othe
canoes ofMaui—theoutriggerless canoes."
Passenger steamships, andthemen-of-war from the
great nations, have taught theTahitians that boats
without sailsandmasts cancross thegreat ocean,
andagain they have recurred tothewords ofthe
prophet Maui, andhave exclaimed, "Otheboats with-
outsailsandmasts." This rather remarkable prophecy
could easily have occurred toMaui ashesaw a
w^ooden calabash floating overrough waters.
Maui's improvement upon nature's plan inregard
tocertain birds isalsogiven inthelegends asaproof
ofhissupernatural powers.
White relates thestory asfollows: "Alaui re-
quested some birds togoandfetch water forhim.The
firstonewould notobey, sohethrew itintothewater.
Herequested another bird togo—and itrefused, so
hethrew itintothe fire,and itsfeathers were burnt.
But thenext bird obeyed, butcould notcarry the
water, andherewarded itbymaking thefeathers of
thefore part ofitshead white. Then heasked an-
other bird togo,and itfilled itsearswithwater and
brought ittoMaui, who drank, andthen pulled the
bird's legsandmade them long inpayment for its
actofkindness."
Dififenbach says: "Maui, theAdam ofNew Zea-
85


land, leftthe cat's cradle totheNew Zealanders as
aninheritance." Thename"Whai" wasgiven tothe
game. Itexhibited thevarious steps ofcreation ac-
cording toMaori mythology. Every change inthe
cradle shows some actincreation. Itsvarious stages
were called "houses." Diffenbach says again: "In
thisgame ofMaui they aregreat proficients. Itis
agame likethat called cat's cradle inEurope. Itis
intimately connected with their ancient traditions and
inthedifferent figures which thecord ismade toas-
sume whilst heldonboth hands, theoutline oftheir
different varieties ofhouses, canoes orfigures ofmen
andwomen areimagined toberepresented." One
writer connects thisgame with witchcraft, andsays
itwasbrought from^ theunder-world. Some parts of
thepuzzle show theadventures ofMaui, especially
hisattempt towinimmortality formen.
InXewZealand itwassaidMaui found alarge, fine-
grained stone block, broke itinpieces, andfrom the
fragments learned how tofashion stone implements.
White also tells theXew Zealand legend ofMaui
andthewinds.
"Maui caught andheld allthewinds save thewest
wind. Heputeachwind into acave, sothat itmight
notblow. Hesought invain forthewest wind, but
could notfindfromwhence itcame. Ifhehadfound
thecave inwhich itstayed hewould have closed the
entrance tothatcave with rocks. When thewest
86


wind blows lightly itisbecause Maui hasgotnear to
it,andhasnearly caught it,and ithasgone into its
home, thecave, toescape him.When thewinds of
thesouth, east,andnorth blow furiously itisbecause
therocks have been removed bythestupid people
who could notlearn thelessons taught byMaui. At
other times Maui allows these winds toblow inhur-
ricanes topunish that people, and also thathemay
rideonthese furious winds insearch ofthewest
wind."
IntheHawaiian legends Maui isrepresented as
greatly interested inmaking and flying kites. His
favorite place forthesportwasbytheboiling pools
oftheWailuku river near Hilo. Hehadthewinds
under hiscontrol andwould callforthem topush his
kites inthedirection hewished. His incantation
calling upthewinds isgiven inthisMaui proverb—
"Strong win,d come,
Softwind come."
White inhis"Ancient History oftheMaoris," re-
lates some ofMaui's experiences with thepeople
whom hefound ontheislands brought upfrom the
under-world. Ononeisland hefound asand house
with eight hundred gods living in it.Apparently
Maui discovered islands with inhabitants, andwas
reported tohave fished them upoutofthedepths of
87


theocean. Fishing was sailing over theocean until
distant lands weredrawn near or"fished up."
Maui walked over theislands andfoundmen living
onthem and firesburning near their homes. Heevi-
dently didnotknowmuch about fire, forhetook itin
hishands. Hewasbadly burned andrushed intothe
sea.Down hedived under thecooling waters and
came upwithoneoftheNew Zealand islands onhis
shoulders. But hishands were still burning, so
wherever heheld theisland itwas setonfire.
These fires are stillburning inthesecret recesses
ofthevolcanoes, andsometimes burst out inflowing
lava. Then Maui paid attention tothepeople whom
hehad fished up.Hetried toteach them, butthey
didnotlearn ashethouglit they should. Hequickly
became angry and said, "It isawaste oflight forthe
suntoshine onsuch stupid people." Sohetried to
hold hishands between them and thesun,butthe
rays ofthesunwere toomany andtoostrong; there-
fore, hecould notshutthem out.Then hetried the
moon andmanaged tomake itdark aj^art ofthetime
eachmonth. Inthiswayhemade alittle trouble for
thestupid people.
There areother hints inthelegends concerning
Maui's desire toberevenged upon anyonewho in-
curred hisdispleasure. Itwas said thatMaui fora
time lived intheheavens above theearth. Here he
88


hadafoster brother Maru. Thetwowere cultivating
the fields. Maru sent asnowstorm overMaui's field.
(Itwould seem asifthismight beaPolynesian mem-
ory ofacold landwhere their ancestors knew the
cold winter, oralesson learned from thesnow-caps
ofhigh mountains.) Atany rate, thesnow blighted
Maui's crops. Maui retaliated bypraying forrain
todestroy Maru's fields. ButMaru managed tosave
apart ofhiscrops. Other legends make Maui the
aggressor. Atthe last,however, Maui became very
angry. The foster parents tried tosoothe thetwomen
bysaying, "Live inpeace with each other anddonot
destroy each other's food." ButMauiwasimplacable
andlayinwait forhisfoster brother, whowas inthe
habit ofcarrying fruit andgrass asanofifering to
thegods ofatemple situated onthesummit ofahill.
HereMaui killed Maru andthenwentaway tothe
earth.
This legend istoldbythree orfour dififerent tribes
ofNew Zealand and isvery similar totheHebrew
story ofCainandAbel. Atthis lateday itisdifficult
tosay definitel}'- whether ornot itowes itsorigin to
theearly touch ofChristianity uponNew Zealand
when whitemen firstbegan tolivewith thenatives.
Itissomewhat similar tostories found intheTonga
Islands andalso intheHawaiian group, where ason
ofthe first gods, orrather ofthe firstmen, kills a
brother. Ineach case there istheshadow oftheBib-
89


lical idea. Itseems safe toinfer thatsuchlegends are
notentirely drawn from contact with Christian civili-
zation. The natives claim that these stories arevery-
ancient, andthat their fathers knew them before the
white men sailed onthePacific.

MVII.
MAUIANDTUNA.
'HEN Maui returned from thevoyages inwhich
hediscovered or"fished up"from theocean
depths new islands, hegave deep thought to
thethings hehadfound. Astheislands appeared to
come outofthewater hesawtheywere inhabited.
There were houses andstages fordrying andpreserv-
ingfood. Hewasgreeted bybarking dogs. Fires
were burning, foodcooking andpeople working. He
evidently hadgone sofaraway fromhome that a
strange people wasfound. Thelegend which speaks
ofthedeath ofhisbrothers, "eaten" bythegreat
fishdrawn upfrom the floor ofthe sea,may very
easily mean that thenew people killed and atethe
brothers.
Maui apparently learned som^enew lessons, foron
hisreturn hequickly established ahome ofhisown,
anddetermined toliveafter thefashion ofthefamilies
inthenew islands.
Maui sought Hina-a-te-lepo, "daughter ofthe
91


swamp," andsecured herashiswife. TheNew Zea-
land tribes telllegends which vary indifferent locali-
tiesabout thiswoman Ilina. Shesometimes bore the
name Rau-kura—"The redplume."
Shecared forhisthatched house asanyother Poly-
nesian woman was inthehabit ofdoing. She at-
tempted thehurried task ofcooking hisfood before
hesnared thesunandgave her sufficient daylight for
herlabors.
They lived near thebank ofariver from which
Hinawas inthehabit ofbringing water forthehouse-
hold needs.
Onedayshewentdown tothestream with hercala-
bash. Shewasentwined with wreaths ofleaves and
flowers, aswasthecustom among Polynesian women.
While shewasstanding onthebank, Tuna-roa, "the
long eel,"saw her.Heswam uptothebank and
suddenly struck herandknocked herinto thewater
andcovered herwith slime from theblow given by
his tail.
Hina escaped andreturned toher horn^c, saying
nothing toMaui about thetrouble. Butthenext day,
while getting water, shewasagain overthrown and
befouled bytheslime ofTuna-roa.
Then Plinabecame angry andreported thetrouble
toMaui.
Maui decided topunish thelong eelandstarted out
tofind hishiding place. Some oftheNew Zealand
92


legends ascollected byWhite, state thatTuna-roa
wasaverysmooth skinned chief,who livedontheoppo-
sitebank ofthestream, and, seeing Hina, had in-
sulted her.
When Mauisaw this chief, hecaught twopieces of
wood over which hewasaccustomed toslide his
canoe into thesea. These hecarried tothestream
and laidthem from bank tobank asabridge over
which hemight entice Tuna-roa tocross.
Maui took hisstone axe, Ma-Tori-Tori, "the
severer," andconcealed himself near thebank ofthe
river.
When "the long eel"hadcrossed thestream, Maui
rushed outand killed himwith amighty blow ofthe
stone axe,cutting theheadfrom thebody.
Other legends saythatMaui found Tuna-roa living
asaneelinadeepwater hole, inaswamp onthesea-
coast ofTata-a, part oftheisland Ao-tea-roa. Other
stories located Tuna-roa inthe river near Maui's
home.
Mauisawthathecould notgetathisenemy with-
outletting ofifthewater which protected him.
Therefore intotheforest went Maui, andwith sa-
cred ceremonies, selected trees from thewood of
which heprepared tools andweapons.
Meanwhile, inaddition totheinsult given toHina,
Tuna-roa hadcaught anddevoured two ofMaui's
93


children, which made Maui more determined tokill
him.
Mauimade thenarrow spade (named bytheMaoris
ofNew Zealand the"ko," andbytheHawaiians
"o-o") and thesharp spears, with which topierce
either theearth orhisenemy. These spears and
spades were consecrated tothework ofpreparinp^ a
ditch bywhich todraw offthewater protectmg "the
long eel."
Thework oftrench-making wasaccomplished with
many incantations andprayers. The ditchwasnamed
"The sacred digging," andwastabooed toallother
purposes except that ofcatching Tuna-roa.
Across thisditchMaui stretched astrong net,and
thenbegan anew series ofchants andceremonies to
bring down anabundance ofrain. Soon theflood
came and theoverflowing waters rushed down the
sacred ditch. The walls ofthedeep poolgaveway
and "the long eel"was carried down thetrench
into thewaiting net.Then there wascommotion.
Tuna-roa wasstruggling forfreedom.
Mauisawhimandhastened tograsp hisstone axe,
"the severer." Hurrying tothenet,hestruck Tuna-
roaaterrible blow, andcutofTthehead. With afew
more blows, hecutthebody inpieces. Thehead and
tailwere carried outinto thesea.Theheadbecame
fishandthe tailbecame thegreat conger-eel. Other
parts ofthebody became seamonsters. Butsome
94


parts which fellinfresh water became thecommon
eels.From thehairs oftheheadcame certain vines
andcreepers among theplants.
After thedeath ofTuna-roa theoflfspring of]\Iaui
were innodanger ofbeing killed andsoon multiplied
into alarge family.
Another NewZealand legend related byWhite says
thatMaui built asliding place oflogs, overwhich
Tuna-roa must passwhen coming from theriver,
Alaui alsomade ascreen behind which hecould se-
crete himself while watching forTuna-roa.
Hecommanded Hina tocomedown totheriverand
waitonthebank toattract Tuna-roa. Soon thelong
eelwasseen inthewater swimming near toHina.
Hina Avent toaplace back ofthelogswhich Alaui
had laiddown.
Tuna-roa came towards her,andbegan toslide
down theskids.
Maui sprang outfrom hishiding place and killed
Tuna-roa with hisaxe,andcuthim inpieces.
The tailbecame theconger-eel. Parts ofhisbody
became fresh-water eels.Some oftheblood fellupon
birds andalways aftermarked them with redspots.
Some oftheblood wasthrown into certain trees,
making thiswood always red.Themuscles became
vines and creepers.
From thistime thechildren ofMaui caught andate
theeels ofboth saltandfresh water. Eeltraps were
95


made, andMaui taught thepeople theproper chants
orincantations tousewhen catching eels.
This legend ofMaui andthelong eelwasfound by
White inanumber offormsamong thedifferent tribes
ofXew Zealand, butdoes notseem tohavehadcur-
rency inmany other island groups.
InTurner's "Samoa" alegend isrelated which was
probably derived from theMaui stories andyetdiffers
initsromantic results. TheSamoans saythatamong
their ancient ones dwelt awoman named Sina. Sina
among thePolynesians isthesame asIlina—the"h"
issoftened into "s". Shecaptured asmall eeland
kept itasapet. Itgrew large andstrong and finally
attacked andbither.She fled,buttheeelfollowed her
everywhere. Her father came toherassistance and
raised highmountains between the eeland herself.
Buttheeelpassed over thebarrier andpursued her.
Hermother raised anew series ofmountains. But
again theeelsurmounted thedifficulties andattempt-
edtoseize Sina. Shebroke away fromhimandran
onandon.Finally shewearily passed through avil-
lage. The people asked her tostayand eatwith
them, butshesaidthey could only help herbydeliv-
ering herfrom thepursuing eel.The inhabitants of
that village were afraid oftheeelandrefused tofight

chief offered her adrink ofwater andpromised to

herhome. This shedid,and intime aplantnew to
theislands sprang up. Itbecame atree,and finally
produced acocoanut, whose twoeyes could continu-
allylook intotheface ofSina.
Tuna, inthelegends ofFiji,wasademon ofthe
sea.Helived inadeep seacave, intowhich hesome-
times shut himself behind closed doors ofcoral.When
hewashungry, heswam through theocean shadows,
always watching therestless surface. When acanoe
passed above him, hewould throw himself swiftly
through thewaters, upset thecanoe, and seizesome
oftheboatmen anddevour them. Hewas greatly
feared byallthefishermen oftheFijian coasts.
Roko—amo-o ordragon god—inhisjourney among
theislands, stopped atavillage b}''theseaandasked
foracanoe andboatmen. The people said:"We
have nothing butavery oldcanoe outthere bythe
water." Hewent toitandfound itinaverybadcon-
dition. Heput itinthewater, anddecided thathe
could use it.Then heasked twomen togowithhim
andpaddle, butthey refused because offear,andex-
plained this fearbytelling thestory ofthewater
demon, who continually sought thedestruction ofthis
97


canoe, and also theirown death. Roko encouraged
them totakehim towage battle withTuna, telling
them hewould destroy themonster. They paddled
until theywere directly overTuna's cave. Roko told
them togoofftoonesideandwaitandwatch, saying:
"Iamgoing down toseethisTuna. Ifyouseered
blood boilupthrough thewater, youmaybesure that
Tuna hasbeen killed. Iftheblood isblack, thenyou
willknow thathehasthevictory and Iamdead."
Roko leaped into thewater andwentdown—down
tothedoor ofthecave. The coral doors were closed.
Hegrasped them inhisstrong hands and torethem
open, breaking them inpieces. Inside hefound cave
after cave ofcoral, andbroke hiswaythrough until
atlastheawoke Tuna. Theangry demon cried:
"Who isthat?" Roko answered: "It isI,Roko,
alone.Who areyou?"
Tuna aroused himself anddemanded Roko's busi-
nessandwhoguided him tothat place. Roko replied:
"Noonehasguided m^e. Igofrom place toplace,
thinking that there isnoone else intheworld."
Tuna shook himself angrily. "Doyouthink Iam
nothing? This day isyour last."
Roko replied: "Perhaps so. Ifthesky falls, I
shall die."
Tuna leaped uponRoko and bithim. Then came
themighty battle ofthecoral caves. Roko broke
Tuna into several pieces—and theredblood poured
98


inboiling bubbles upward through theclear ocean
waters, andtheboatmen cried :"The blood isred—
theblood isred—Tuna isdeadbythehand ofRoko."
Roko lived foratime inFiji,where hisdescendants
still findtheirhome. Thepeople usethischant toaid
them indifficulties:
"My load isaredone.
Itpoints infront toKawa (Roko's home).
Behind, itpoints toDolomo—(avillage onanother island)."
IntheHawaiian legends, HinawasMaui's mother
rather than hiswife, andKuna (Tuna) wasamo-o, a
dragon orgigantic lizard possessing miraculous
powers.
Hina's home was inthelarge caveunder thebeau-
tifulRainbow Falls near thecity ofHilo. Above the
falls thebedoftheriver isalong thechannel ofan
ancient lava flow. Sometimes thewater pours ina
torrent over therugged lava, sometimes itpasses
through underground passages aswell asalong the
black river bed,andsometimes itthrusts itself into
boiling pools.
Maui lived onthenorthern side oftheriver, buta
chiefnamed Kuna-moo—adragon—lived intheboil-
ingpools. Heattacked Hina andthrew adam across
theriver below Rainbow Falls, intending todrown
Hina inhercave. The great ledge ofrock filled the
river bedhighupthebank ontheHilo side ofthe
99


river. Hina called onMaui foraid. Maui came
quickly andwithmighty blows cutoutanewchannel
fortheriver—thepath itfollows tothis day.The
waters sank andHina remained unharmed inher
cave.
The place where Kuna dwelt was called Wai-kuna—theKuna water. The river inwhich Hina and
Kuna dwelt bears thename Wailuku—"the destruc-
tive water." Maui went above Kuna's home and
poured hotwater into the river. This part ofthe
myth could easily have arisen from alavaoutburst on
thesideofthevolcano above theriver. Thehotwater
swept inaflood over Kuna's home. Kuna jumped
from theboiling pools over aseries ofsmall fallsnear
hishome into theriver below. Here thehotwater
again scalded himand inpain heleaped from the
river tothebank, where Maui killed himbybeating
himwith aclub. Hisbody waswashed down the
river over the fallsunder which Hina dwelt, intothe
ocean.
The story ofKuna orTuna isalegend with a
foundation intheenmity between two chiefs ofthe
long ago,andalso inadesire toexplain theorigin of
thefamily ofeelsandtheinvention ofnetsand traps.

VIII.
MAUIANDHISBROTHER-IN-LAW.
^^ipHE "Stories ofMaui's Brother-in-Law," andof
ill "Maui seeking Immortality," arenotfound in^^ Hawaiian mythology. Wedepend upon Sir
George Grey andJohnWhite fortheNew Zealand
myths inwhich both ofthese legends occur.
Maui's sister Hina-uri married Ira-waru, whowas
willing towork with hisskillful brother-in-law. They
hunted intheforests andspeared birds. They fished
andfarmed together. They passed through many ex-
periences simiilar tothose Maui's own brothers had
suffered before thebrother-in-law took their place as
Maui's companion. They made spears together—but
Maui made notched barbs forhisspear ends—and
slipped them offwhen Ira-waru came near. Sofora
long time theproceeds ofbirdhunting felltoMaui.
But after atime thebrother-in-law learned thesecret
asthebrothers hadbefore, andMauiwaslooked upto
byhisfellow hunter asthe skillful one. Sometimes
101


Ira-waru was able tosee atonce Maui's planand
adopt it.Hediscovered Maui's method ofmaking the
punga oreelbaskets forcatching eels.
Thetwohunters went totheforest tofind acer-
tain creeping vine with which toweave their eel
snares. Ira-waru made abasket with ahole,bywhich
theeelscould enter, butthey could turnaround and
gooutthesame way. Soheveryseldom caught an
eel.ButMauimade hisbasket with along funnel-
shaped door, bywhich theeelscould easily slide into
thesnare butcould scarcely escai)e. Hemade adoor
inthesidewhich hefastened tight until hewished to
pour theeels out.
Ira-waru immediately made abasket likeMaui.
Then Maui became angry and uttered incantations
over Ira-waru. Themandropped ontheground and
became adog. Maui returned home andmet his
sister, whocharged himwith sorcery concerning her
husband.
Maui didnotdeny theexercise ofhispower, but
taught hissister achant andsentherouttothelevel
country. There sheuttered herchant andastrange
dogwith long haircame toher,barking andleaping
around her.Then sheknew what Maui haddone.
"Thus Ira-waru became the first ofthelong-haired
dogswhose flesh hasbeen tabooed towomen."
TheTahu andHau tribes ofNew Zealand tella
different story. They say thatMaui went tovisit
102


Ira-waru. Together they setoutonajourney. After
atimethey rested bythewayside andbecame sleepy.
Maui asked Ira-waru tocleanse hishead. Thisgave
him the restful, soothing touch which aided sleep.
ThenMaui proposed thatIra-waru sleep. Taking the
head inhishands, Maui put hisbrother-in-law to
sleep. Then byincantations hemade thesleep very
deep andprolonged. Meanwhile hepulled theears
andarms andlimbs until theywere properly length-
ened. Hedrew outtheunder jaw until ithadthe
form ofadog's mouth. Hestretched theendofthe
backbone into atail,andthenwakened Ira-waru and
drove himbackwhen hetried tofollow thepath to
thesettlement.
Hina-uri went outand called herhusband. He
came toher,leaping andbarking. Shedecided that this
washerhusband, and inheragony reproached Maui
andwandered away.
TheRua-nui story-tellers ofNew Zealand saythat
Maui's anger wasaroused against Ira-waru because
heate allthebaitwhen theywent fishing, andthey
could catch nofishafter paddling outtothefashing
grounds. When they cam-e toland,Maui told Ira-
waru toliedown inthesand asaroller overwhich
todrag thecanoe upthebeach. When hewaslying
helpless under thecanoe, Maui changed him into a
dog.
TheArawa legends make thecause ofMaui's anger
103


thesuccess ofIra-waru while fishing. Ira-waru had
many fishwhile Maui hadcaptured butfew.The
story istoldthus: "Ira-waru hooked afishand in
pulling itinhislinebecame entangled with that of
Maui. Maui feltthejerking andbegan topull inhis
line. Soon they pulled their lines close uptothe
canoe, onetothebow, theother tothestern, where
eachwas sitting. Maui said: 'Letmepullthelines
tome,asthefish isonmyhook.' Hisbrother-in-law
said: 'Not so;thefish isonmine.' ButMaui said:
'Letmepullmyline in.'Ira-waru didsoandsaw
that thefishwasonhishook. Then hesaid: 'Untwist
your linesand letmine go,that Imay pullthefish in.'
Maui said: 'Iwilldoso,but letmehave time.' He
took the fish offIra-waru's hook andsaw that there
was abarb onthehook. Hesaid toIra-waru: 'Per-
hapsweought toreturn toland.' When theywere
dragging thecanoe onshore, Maui said toIra-waru:
'Getbetween thecanoe andoutrigger and drag.' Ira-
waru didsoandMaui leaped ontheoutrigger and
weighed itheavily down andcrushed Ira-waru pros-
trateonthebeach. Maui trodonhimandpulled his
backbone long likeatailandchanged himinto adog."
Maui issaid tohave tattooed themuzzle ofthedog
with abeautiful pattern which thebirds (kahui-zara,
aflock oftern) used inmarking thesky.From this
alsocame theredglow which sometimes flushes the
face ofman.
104


Another Arawa version ofthelegend wasthatMaui
andIra-waru were journeying together. Ira-waru was
gluttonous andatethebest food. AtlastMaui deter-
mined topunish hiscompanion. Byincantation he
lengthened theway until Ira-waru became faintand
weary. Maui hadprovided himself with alittle food
andtherefore wasenabled toendure thelongway.
While Ira-waru sleptMaui trodonhisbackbone and
lengthened itandchanged thearms andlimbs into
thelegsofadog.When Hina-uri sawthestate ofher
husband shewent into thethatched house bywhich
Ira-waru hadsooften stood watching thehollow log
inwhich shedried the fishandpreserved thebirds
speared inthemountains. Shebound hergirdle and
hala-leaf apron around herandwentdown tothesea
todrown herself, thatherbodymight beeaten bythe
monsters ofthesea.When shecame tothe shell-
covered beach, shesatdown andsang herdeath song—
"Iweep, Icalltothesteep billows ofthesea
And tohim, thegreat, theocean god;
Tomonsters, allnow hidden,
Tocome andbury me,
"Whonowamwrapped inmourning.
Letthewaves wear their mourning, too,
And sleep assleeps thedead."
—Ancient Maui Chant ofNew Zealand.
Then Hina-uri threw herself intotheseaandwas
borne onthewaves many moons, atlast drifting to
105


shore, tobefound bytwofishermen. They carried
thebody offtothe fireandwarmed itback tohfe.
They brushed offtheseamoss andseaweeds and
rubbed heruntil sheawoke.
Soon they told their chief, Tini-rau, what abeauti-
fulwoman theyhadfound inthesea.Hecame and
took heraway tomake heroneofhiswives. Butthe
other wives were jealous anddrove Hina-uri away
fromj thechief's houses.
Another New Zealand legend says thatHinacame
totheseaand called foralittle fish toaidher in
going away from theisland. Ittried tocarry her,but
wastooweak. Hina struck itwith heropen hand.
Ithadstriped sides forever after. She tried alarger
fish,but felloffbefore theyhadgone farfrom shore. Her
blow gave this fish itsbeautiful blue spots. Another
received black spots. Another shestamped herfoot
upon, making itflat.Atlastashark carried herfar
away. Shewasvery thirsty, andbroke acocoanut
ontheshark's head, making abump, which hasbeen
handed down forgenerations. Theshark carried her
tothehome ofthetwowhorescued herandgave her
new strength.
Meanwhile Rupe orMaui-mua, abrother ofHina-
uriandMaui, grieved forhissister. Hesought for
herthroughout thelandandthen launched hiscanoe
upon theblue waters surrounding Ao-tea-roa (The
Great White Land ;theancient nativeNew Zealand)

andsearched thecoasts. Heonly learned that his
sister had, asthenatives said, "leaped intothewaters
andbeen carried away intotheheavens."
Rupe's heart filled with thedesire tofindandpro-
tect thefrenzied sister whohadprobably taken a
canoe andfloated away, outofthehorizon, seenfrom
New Zealand coasts, intonew horizons. During the
Viking age ofthe Pacific, whenmany chiefs sailed
long distances, visiting themost remote islands of
Polynesia, they frequently spoke ofbreaking through
from thehome land intonewheavens—orofclimbing
upthepath ofthesunonthewaters into anew
heaven. Thiswas their poetical way ofpassing from
horizon tohorizon. The horizon around their par-
ticular island surrounded their complete world. Out-
side,somewhere, were other worlds andother heavens.
Rupe's voyage wasanidyll ofthePacific. Itwasone
more story tobeadded totheprose poems ofconse-
crated travel. Itwasabrother feeling through the
mysteries ofunknown lands forasister, asdear to
him asanEvangeline hasbeen toother men.
From them^ist-land ofthePolynesian racecomes
thisstory ofthetrickery ofMaui thelearned, andthe
faithfulness ofhisolder brother Maui-mua orRupe—
oneofthe"five forgetful Mauis." Rupe hoisted mat-
sails over hiscanoe andthusmade thewinds serve
him.Hepaddled thecanoe onward through thehoins
when calms rested onglassy waves.
107


Thus hepassed outofsight ofAo-tea-roa, away
from hisbrothers, andoutofthereach ofalltricks
andincantations ofMaui, themischievous. Hesailed
until anew island roseoutoftheseatogreet him.
Here ina"new heaven" hefound friends tocare for
himandprepare him forhislonger journey. His
restless anxiety forhissister urged himonward until
days lengthened intomonths andmonths into years.
Hepassed from thehorizons ofnewly-discovered
islands, into thehorizons ofcircling skies around
islands ofwhich hehadnever heard before. Some-
times hefound relatives, butmore frequently hiswel-
come cam-e from thosewho could trace nohistorical
touch intheir genealogies.
Here and there, apparently, hefound traces ofa
woman whose description answered that ofhissister
Hina-uri. Atlasthelooked through theheavens upon
anewworld, andsaw hissister ingreat trouble.
According tosome legends thejealous wives ofthe
great chief, Tini-rau, attack Hina,whowasknown
among them asHina-te-ngaru-moana, "Hina, the
daughter oftheocean." Tini-rau andHina lived
away from thevillage ofthechief until their littleboy
was born.When they needed food, thechief said,
"Let usgotomysettlement andweshall have food
provided."
ButHina chanted:
108


"Let itdown, let itdown,
Descend, ob!descend—"
and sufficient food fellbefore them. After atime
their frailclothing wore out,andthecold chilled them,
thenHina again uttered theincantation andclothing
wasprovided fortheir need.
Butthejealous wives, two innumber, finally heard
where Hina andthechiefwere living, andstarted to
seethem,
Tini-rau said toHina, "Here comemyother wives—
becareful howyouactbefore them."
She replied, "Iftheycome inanger itwillbeevil,"
Shearmed herself with anobsidian orvolcanic-
glass knife, andwaited their comang.
They tried tothrow enchantments around herto
killher.Then oneofthemmade ablow atherwith
aweapon, butsheturned itaside and killed her
enemy with theobsidian knife.
Then theother wifemade anattack, andagain the
obsidian knife brought death. Sheripped open the
stomachs ofthejealous ones andshowed thechief
fish linesandsinkers andother property which they
hadeaten inthepastandwhich Tini-rau hadnever
been able totrace.
Another legend says that thetwowomen came to
killHinawhen they heard ofthebirth ofherboy.
Foratime shewasgreatly terrified. Then shesaw
109


thattheywerecoming from different directions. She
attacked thenearest onewith astone and killed her.
Thebody burst open, andwasseen tobefullofgreen
stone. Then she killed thesecond wife inthesame
way,andfound more green stones. "Thus, according
tothelegends, originated thegreenstone" fromwhich
thechoicest andmost valuable stone tools have since
been made. Foratime thechiefandHina lived hap-
pily together. Then hebegan toneglect herand
abuse her, until shecried aloud forherbrother—
"ORupe! come down.
Takemeandmychild."
Rupe assumed theform ofabirdandflewdown to
thisworld inwhich hehadfound his sister. He
chanted ashecam-edown—
"It isRupe, yesRupe,
The elder brother;
And Iamhere."
Hefolded themother andherboyunder hiswings
andflewaway with them. SirGeorge Gray relates
alegend inwhich Maui-mua orRupe isrecorded as
having carried hissister andherchild toone ofthe
new lands, found inhislong voyage, where dwelt an
aged relative, ofchief rank, with hisretainers.
Some legends saythatTini-rau tried tocatch Rupe,
110


whowascompelled todrop thechild inorder toes-
capewith themother. Tini-rau caught thechildand
carefully cared forhim until hegrew tobeastrong
young lad.
Then hewanted tofind hismother andbring her
back tohisfather. How thiswas done,howRupe
took hissister back totheold chief, andhow civil
wars arose arenot allthese told inthelegends ofthe
Maoris. Thus the tricks ofMaui themischievous
brought trouble foratime, butwere finally over-
shadowed byhappy homes inneighboring lands for
hissuflfering sister andherdescendants.

MAUrS KITE FLYING.
AUI thedemi-god wassometimes theHercules
ofPolynesia. His exploits were fully as
marvelous asthose ofthehero ofclassic
mythology. Hesnared thesun.Hepulled upislands
from theocean depths. He lifted theskyinto its
present position andsmoothed itsarched surface with
hisstone adze. These stories belong toallPolynesia.
There arenumerous less im^portant local myths,
some ofthem peculiar toNew Zealand, some tothe
Society Islands andsome totheHawaiian group.
One oftheoldnative Hawaiians says that inthe
long, longagothebirds were flying around thehomes
oftheancient people. The flutter oftheir wings
could beheard andtheleaves andbranches moved
when themotion ofthewings ceased andthewan-
derers through the airfound resting places. Then
came sweet music from thetrees andthepeople mar-
velled. Only oneofallmankind could seethewinged
112


warblers. Maui, thedemi-god, hadclear vision. The
swift-flying wings covered with redorgold hesaw.
Thethroats tinted many colors andreflecting thesun-
light withdiamond sparks ofvaried hueshewatched
while they trembled with themelody ofsweet bird
songs. Allothers heard butdidnotsee.They were
blind andyethadopen vision.
Sometimes theiiwi (asmall redbird) fluttered in
theairanduttered itsshrill, happy song, andMaui
sawandheard. Butthebird atthattimewaswithout
color intheeyes oftheancient people andonly the
clear voice was heard, while nospeck ofbird life
flecked theclear skyoverhead.
Atone timie agodfrom one oftheother islands
came tovisitMaui. Each boasted ofanddescribed the
beauties andmerits ofhisisland. While theywere
conversing, Maui called forhisfriends thebirds.They
gathered around thehouse and fluttered among the
leaves ofthesurrounding trees. Soon their sweet
voices filled theaironallsides. Allthepeople won-
dered andworshiped, thinking theyheard thefairy or
mcnehune people. Itwas said thatMaui hadpainted
thebodies ofhisinvisible songsters and foralong
timehadkept thedelight oftheir flashing colors to
himself. Butwhen thevisitor hadrejoiced inthemys-
terious harmonies, Maui decided totakeaway what-
ever veilshut outthesight ofthese things beautiful,
that hisbird friends might beknown andhonored
113


ever after. Sohemade thebirds reveal themselves
perched inthetrees orflying inthe air.The clear
eyes ofthegod firstrecognized thenew revelation,
then allthepeople became dumb before thesweet
singers adorned inalltheir brilliant tropical plumage.
The beautiful redbirds, iiwiandakakani, andthe
birds ofglorious yellow feathers, theooandthemamo,
were ajoytoboth eyeandearandfound high places
inHawaiian legend andstory, and allgave theirmost
beautiful feathers forthecloaks andhelmets ofthe
chiefs.
TheMaoris ofNewZealand saythatMaui could at
willchange himself intoabirdandwith hisfeathered
friends find ahome inleafy shelters. Inbirdform he
visited thegods oftheunder-world. Hiscapricious
soulwas sensitive tothetouch ofallthatmysterious
lifeofnature.
With thebirds ascompanions andthewinds ashis
servants Maui must soon have turned hisinventive
mind tokitemaking.
TheHawaiian myths areperhaps theonly ones of
thePacific Ocean which give toany ofthegods the
pleasure andexcitement ofkite flying. Maui, after
repeated experiments, made alarge kite forhimself.
Itwasmuch larger thananyhouse ofhistime or
generation. Hetwisted along linefrom thestrong
fibers ofthenative plantknown astheolona. He
endowed both kiteandstring withmarvelous powers

andlaunched thekiteuptoward theclouds. Itrose
very slowly. Thewinds were not lifting itinto the
sky.
Mauiremembered thatanoldpriest lived inWaipio
valley, thelargest and finest valley ofthelarge island,
Hawaii, onwhich hemade hishome.
This priest hadacovered calabash inwhich hecom-
pelled thewinds tohidewhen hedidnotwishthem
toplayonlandand sea.The priest's name wasKa-
leiioku, and hiscalabash wasknown asipu-makani-
akamaumau. "the calabash oftheperpetual winds."
Maui called forthe priest whohadcharge ofthe
winds toopen hiscalabash and letthem come upto
Hiloandblow along theWailuku river. Thenatives say
that theplace where Maui stood wasmarked bythe
pressure ofhisfeet inthelavarocks oftheriverbank
ashebraced himself tohold thekiteagainst thein-
creasing force ofthewinds which pushed ittowards
thesky.Then theenthusiasm ofkite flying filled his
youthful soulandhecried aloud, screaming hischal-
lenge along thecoast oftheseatoward Waipio—
"Owinds, winds of"Waipio,
Inthecalabash ofKaleiioku.
Come from theipu-makani,
wind, thewind ofHilo,
Come quickly, come withpower."
115


Then thepriest lifted thecover ofthecalabash of
thewinds and letthestrong winds ofHilo escape.
Along theseacoast theyrushed until asthey entered
HiloBaythey heard thevoice ofMaui calling—
"Owinds, vs-inds ofHilo,
Hasten andcome tome."
With atumultuous rush thestrong winds turned
toward themountains. They forced theirwayalong
thegorges andpalisades oftheWailuku river. They
leaped intotheheavens, making afierce attack upon
themonster which IMaui hadsent into thesky.The
kitestruggled asitwaspushed upward bythehands
ofthefierce winds, butMaui rejoiced. Hisheart was
uplifted bythejoyoftheconflict inwhich hisstrength
toholdwas pitted against thepower ofthewinds to
tearaway. And again heshouted toward thesea—
"Owinds, thewinds ofHilo,
Come tothemountains, come."
Thewinds which hadbeen stirring upstorms on
theface ofthewaters came inland. They dashed
against Maui. They climbed theheights oftheskies
until they fellwith fullviolence against theirmighty
foehanging intheheavens.
The kitehadbeenmade ofthe strongest kapa
(paper cloth) which Maui's mother could prepare.
116


Itwasnottorn, although itwasbentbackward toits
utmost limit. Then thestrain came onthestrong
cord ofolona fibre. The linewas stretched and
strained asthekitewaspushed back. Then Maui
called again andagain forstronger winds tocome.
Thecordwasdrawn outuntil thekitewas farabove
themountains. Atlast itbroke and the kitewas
tossed over thecraters ofthevolcanoes totheland
ofthedistrict ofKa-u ontheother side oftheisland.
Then Mauiwasangry andhastily leaped over the
mountains, which arenearly fourteen thousand feet
inaltitude. Inahalfdozen strides hehadcrossed the
fifty orsixty miles from hishome totheplace where
thekite lay.Hecould pass overmany miles with a
single step. Hisnam^e wasMaui-Mama, "Maui the
Swift." When Maui returned with hiskitehewas
more careful incalling thewinds toaidhim inhis
sport.
Thepeople watched their wise neighbor andsoon
learned thatthekitecould beagreat blessing tothem.
When itwassoaring intheskytherewasalways dry
andpleasant weather. Itwas adayforgreat rejoic-
ing.They could spread outtheirkapa cloth todryas
long asthekitewas inthesky.They could carry
out their necessary work without fear ofthe rain.
Therefore when anyonesaw thekitebeginning to
float along themountain sidehewould calloutjoy-
fully, ''E!Maui's kite isintheheavens." Maui would
117


send hiskite into theblueskyandthen tietheline
tothegreat black stones inthebed oftheWailuku
river.
Maui soon learned thepower ofhis kitewhen
blown upon byafierce wind. With hisaccustomed
skill heplanned tomake useofhisstrong servant,
andtherefore took thekitewithhimonhisjourneys
totheother islands, using ittoaidinmaking swift
voyages. With thewind intheright direction, the
kitecould pull hisdouble canoe very easily andquickly
toitsdestination.
Time passed, andeven thedemi-god died.The fish
hook withwhich hedrew theHawaiian Islands up
from thedepths oftheseawasallowed tolieonthe

thestone. Thedouble canoe was carried farinland
andthen permitted topetrify bytheriver side.The
two stones which represent thedouble canoe now

THEOAHU LEGENDS OFMAUI.
EVERAL Maui legends have been located onthe
island ofOahu. They were given byMr.Kaaia
toMr.T.G.Thrum, thepublisher ofwhat iswell
known intheHawaiian Islands as"Thrum's Annual."
Hehaskindly furnished them foradded interest tothe
present volume. The legends have adistinctly local
flavor confined entirely toOahu. Ithasseemed bestto
reserve them forachapter bythemselves although they
arechiefly variations ofstories already told.
MAUIANDTHETWOGODS.
This history ofMaui andhisgrandmother Hina begins
with their arrival from foreign lands. They dwelt in
Kane-ana (Kane's cave), Waianae, Oahu. This isan
"ana," orcave, atPuu-o-hulu. Hina hadwonderful
skill inmaking allkinds oftapaaccording tothecustom
ofthewomen ofancient Hawaii.
Maui went totheKoolau sideandrested atKaha-luu,
119


adiving place inKoolaupoko. Inthat place there isa
noted hillcalled ^la-eli-eli. This isthestory ofthat hill.
Maui threw upapileofdirtandconcealed rubbish under
it.Thetwogods, Kane andKanaloa, came along and
asked Mauiwhat hewasdoing. Hesaid,"What you se«*.
Youtwodigonthat side tothefootofthepali, (preci-
pice) and Iwillgodown atKaha-luu. Ifyoutwo
digthrough first,youmay killme. IfIgetthrough
first Iwill killyou." They agreed, andbegan todig
andthrown upthe dirt.Then Maui dugthree times
andtossed upsome ofthe hills ofthat place. Kane
andKanaloa sawthatMauiwasdigging very fast, so
they putforth very great strength andthrew thedirt
into ahill. Meanwdiile Maui ranaway totheother
side oftheisland. Thus bytheaidofthegods the hill
Ma-eli-eli wasthrown upandreceived itsname "eli,"
meaning "dig." "Ma-eli-eli" meant "the place ofdig-
ging-"
HOWTHEYFOUND FIRE.
Itwassaid thatMaui andHina hadnofire.They
were often coldandhadnocooked food. Maui saw
flames rising inadistant place andran toseehow
theywere made. W'hen hecame tothat place the
firewasoutandsome birds flewaway. One ofthem
wasKa-Alae-huapi. "the stingy Alae"—asmall duck,
theHawaiian mud hen.Maui watched again andsaw

fire.When hewent upthebirdssawhimcoming and
scattered the fire,carrying theashes into thewater;
butheleaped andcaught the little Alae. "Ah!" he
said, "Iwill killyou,because youdonot letmehave
fire." The bird replied, "Ifyou killmeyoucannot
find fire." Maui said,"Where isfire?" TheAlae said,
"Gouponthehigh landwhere beautiful plants with
large leaves arestanding; rubtheir branches." Maui
setthebird freeandwent inland fromHalawa and
found dryland taro.Hebegan torubthestalks, but
only juicecame out likewater. Hehadnored fire.
Hewasveryangry and said, "Ifthat lying Alae is
caught again bymie Iwillbeitsdeath."
After awhile hesaw the fireburning andran
swiftly. The birdssawhimand cried, "The cooking
isover. Here comes theswift grandchild ofHina."
They scattered the fire; threw theashes away and
flew intothewater. Butagain Maui caught theAlae
andbegan tokill it,saying: "You gavemeaplant
fullofwater fromwhich toget fire." The bird said,
"If Idieyoucannever find fire. Iwillgiveyouthe
secret offire.Take abranch ofthatdrytreeandrub."
Maui held thebird fast inonehand while herubbed
with theother untilsmoke and firecame out.Then
hetook the firestickandrubbed thehead ofthebird,
making aplace where redandwhite feathers have
grown ever since.
121


Hereturned toHina andtaught herhow tomake
fire,using thetwo firesticks andhow totwist coco-
nutfibre tocatch the firewhen ithadbeen kindled in
wood. ButtheAlaewasnotforgotten. Itwas called
huapi, "sting}%" because itselfishly kept theknowledge
offiremaking toitself.
MAUICATCHING THESUN.
Maui watched Hina making tapa. Thewettapa
wasspread onalong tapa board, andHina began at
oneend topound itintoshape; pounding from one
endtoanother. Henoticed thatsunset came bythe
time shehadpounded tothemiddle oftheboard.
Thesunhurried sofastthatshecould onlybegin her
work before thedaywas past.
Hewent tothe hill Hele-a-ka-la, which means
"journey ofthesun." Hethought hewould catch the
sunandmake itmove slowly. Hewent upthe hill
andwaited. When thesunbegan torise,Mauimade
himself long, stretching uptoward thesky.Soon the
shining legs ofthesuncame upthehillside. Hesaw
Maui andbegan torunswiftly, butMaui reached out
andcaught oneofthelegs, saying: "Osun, Iwill kill
you.You areamischief maker. Youmake trouble
forHina bygoing sofast." Then hebroke theshin-
inglegofthesun.The sufferer said, "Iwillchange
mywayandgoslowly—sixmonths slow and six
122


months faster." Thus arose thesaying, "Long shall
bethedaily journey ofthesunandheshall give light
for allthepeople's toil." Hina learned thatshecould
pound until shewas tired while thefarmers could
plant andtake care oftheir fields. Thus also this
hillreceived itsname Hele-a-ka-la. This isoneofthe
hills ofWaianae near theprecipice ofthe hillPuu-o-
hulu.
UNITING THEISLANDS.
Maui suggested toHina thathehadbetter trytodraw
theislands together, uniting them inoneland. Hina
toldMaui togoandseeAlae-nui-a-Hina, whowould
tellhimwhat todo.TheAlae toldhimtheymust go
toPonaha-ke-one (afishing place outside ofPearl
Harbor) and findKa-uniho-kahi, "theonetoothed,"
who held thelandunder thesea.
Maui went back toHina. She toldhim toaskhis
brothers togofishing with him.They consented and
pushed outinto the sea.SoonMaui saw abailing
dish floating bythecanoe andpicked itup. Itwas
named Hina-a-ke-ka, "Hina who fell off."They pad-
dled toPonaha-ke-one. When theystopped theysaw
abeautiful young woman intheboat. Then they an-
chored andagain looked intheboat, buttheyoung
woman was gone. They saw thebailing dishand
threw itintothesea.
123


Maui-mua threw hishook andcaught alarge fish,
which wasseen tobeashark astheydrew ittothe
surface. Atonce they cutthe line. Soalso Alaui-
hope andMaui-waena. AtlastMaui threw hishook
Manai-i-ka-lani intothesea. Itwentdown, down into
thedepths, Maui cried, "Hina-a-ke-ka hasmyhook
inherhand. Byher itwillbemade fast." Hina
wentdown with thehook until shemetKa-uniho-kahi.
Sheasked him toopen hismouth, then threw the
hook farinside andmade itfast.Then shepulled the
linesothatMaui should know that the fishwas
caught. Maui fastened the line totheoutrigger of
thecanoe andasked hisbrothers topaddle with all
diligence, andnotlook back. Long, long, they pad-
dledandwere very tired. Then Maui took apaddle
anddipped deep inthe sea.The boatmoved more
swiftly through the sea.The brothers looked back
and cried, "There isplenty oflandbehind us."The
charm wasbroken. Thehookcame outof"theone
toothed," andtheraised islands sank back into their
place. The native say,"The islands arenow united
toAmerica. Perhaps Maui hasbeen atwork."
MAUIANDPEA-PEA THEEIGHT-EYED.
Maui hadbeen fishing andhadcaught agreat fish
upon which hewas feasting. Helooked inland and
saw hiswife, Kumu-lama, seized and carried away

byPea-pea-maka-walu, "Pea-pea the eight-eyed."
This isalegend derived from themyths ofmany
islands inwhich Lupe orRupe (pigeon) changed him-
self into abirdandflew after hissister Hinawho
hadbeen carried ontheback ofashark todistant
islands. Sometimes asamanandsometimes asabird
heprosecuted hissearch untilHinawasfound.
Maui pursued Pea-pea, butcould notcatch him.
Hecarried Maui's wife over theseatoafaraway
island. Maui was greatly troubled but hisgrand-
mother senthiminland tofindanoldmanwhowould
tellhimwhat todo.Maui went inland andlooking
down toward Waipahu saw thisman Ku-olo-kele. He
washump-backed. Maui threw alarge stone and hit
the "hillontheback" knocked itoffandmade the
back straight. The oldman lifted upthestone and
threw ittoWaipahu, where itliestothisday.Then
heandMaui talked together. HetoldMaui togo
andcatch birds andgather tileaves and fibers of
the ie-ie vine, and fillhishouse. These things Maui
secured andbrought tohim.HetoldMaui togo
home andreturn after three days.
Ku-olo-kele took the tileaves andthe ie-ie threads
andmade thebody ofagreat birdwhich hecovered
with bird feathers. Hefastened alltogether with
the ie-ie. Thiswasdone inthe firstday.Thesecond
dayheplaced food inside and tried hisbirdand it
125


flew allright. "Thus," asthetiawaiians say,"the
first flying shipwasmade inthetime ofMaui." This
isamodern version ofRupe changing himself intoa
bird.
OnthethirddayMauicame andsawthewonderful
birdbody thoroughly prepared forhisjourney. Maui
went inside. Ku-olo-kele said,"When youreach that
land, look foravillage. Ifthepeople arenotthere
look tothebeach. Ifthere aremany people, your
wifeandPea-pea theeight-eyed willbethere. Donot
gonear, but flyoutover the sea.The people will
say, 'O, the strange bird;'butPea-pea will say,
'This ismybird. Itistabu.' You canthencome
tothepeople."
Maui pulled the ie-ie ropes fastened tothewings
andmade them move. Thus heflewaway into the
sky.Two dayswas hisjourney before hecame to
thatstrange island, Moana-liha-i-ka-wao-kele. Itwas
abeautiful land. Heflew inland toavillage, but
there were nopeople; according totheancient chant:
"The houses ofLima-loa stand,
Butthere arenopeople;
They areatMana."
Thepeople werebythesea.Maui flewoverthem.
Hesaw hiswife, buthepassed onflying outover the
sea,skimming likeaseabirddown tothewater and
126


rising gracefully uptothesky. Pea-pea called out,
"This ismybird. Itistabu." Maui heard andcame
tothebeach. Hewascaught andplaced inatabu
box.Theservants carried him^uptothevillage and
puthim inthechief's sleeping house, when Pea-pea
and hispeople returned totheir homes.
Inthenight Pea-pea andMaui's wife laydown to
sleep. Maui watched Pea-pea, hoping thathewould
soon sleep. Then hewould killhim. Maui waited.
One eyewas closed, seven eyeswere opened. Then
foureyes closed, leaving three. Thenightwasalmost
pastanddawn was near. Then Maui called toHina
with hisspirit voice,"OHina, keep itdark." Hina
made thegraydawn dark inthethree eyesandtwo
closed insleep. The lasteyewasweary, and italso
slept. Then Maui went outofthebirdbody andcut
offthehead ofPea-pea andput itinside thebird.He
broke theroof ofthehouse until alarge opening was
made. Hetook hiswife,Kumu-lama, andflewaway
totheisland ofOahu. Thewinds blew hard against
theflying bird. Rain fellintorrents around it,but
those inside hadnotrouble.
"Thus Maui returned with hiswife tohishome in
Oahu. The story ispau (finished)."

MAUI SEEKING IMMORTALITY.
Climb up,climb up.
Tothehighest surface ofheaven,
Toallthesides ofheaven.
Climb then tothyancestor,
The sacred bird inthesky,
Tothyancestor Rehua
Intheheavens.—New Zealand kite incantation.
^^rHE story ofMaui seeking immortality forthe
/|l human race isone ofthe finest myths inthe^^ world. Forpure imagination andpathos itis
difficult tofindany talefrom Grecian orLatin liter-
ature tocompare with it.InGreek andRoman fables
gods suffered forother gods, andyetnonewere sur-
rounded with such absolutely mythical experiences as
those through which thedemi-god Maui ofthePa-
cificOcean passed when heentered thegates ofdeath
with thehope ofwinning immortality formankind.
The really remarkable group oflegends which cluster
128


around Maui iswell concluded bythestory ofhis
unselfish andheroic battle with death.
The different islands ofthePacific have theirHades,
orabode ofdead. Itis,with very few exceptions,
down intheinterior ofthe earth. Sometimes the
tunnels leftbycurrents ofmelted lava arethepas-
sages into thehome ofdeparted spirits. InSamoa
there aretwo circular holesamong therocks atthe
west end oftheisland Savaii. These aretheen-
trances totheunder-world forchiefs andpeople. The
spirits ofthose wdio dieontheother islands leap into
theseaandswim around theland from island to
island until they reach Savaii. Then they plunge
down into their heaven ortheir hades.
TheTongans hadaspirit island forthehome of
thedead. They saidthatsome natives once sailed far
away inacanoe andfound this island. Itw^ascov-
eredwith allmanner ofbeautiful fruits, among which
rare birds sported. They landed, butthetreeswere
shadov/s. They grasped butcould nothold them.
The fruits andthebirdswere shadows. Themen ate,
butswallowed nothing substantial. Itwasshadow-
land. They walked through allthedelights their
eyeslooked upon, butfound nosubstance. They re-
turned home, buteverseemed tolisten tospirits
calling them back totheisland. Inashort time all
thevoyagers were dead.
There isnoescape from death. Thenatives ofNew
129


Zealand say: '"Man mayhave descendants, butthe
daughters ofthenight strangle hisoffspring"; and
again :"Men make heroes, butdeath carries them
away."
There areveryfewlegends among thePolynesians
concerning thedeath ofjMaui. And these areusually
fragmentary, except among theMaoris ofNew Zea-
land.
TheHawaiian legend ofthedeath ofMaui isto
theeffect thatheoffended some ofthegreater gods
living inWaipio valley ontheIsland ofHawaii. Ka-
naloa, oneofthefour greatest gods ofHawaii, seized
himanddashed him against therocks. Hisblood
burst fromi thebody andcolored theearth red inthe
upper part ofthevalley. TheHawaiians inanother
legend saythatMaui waschasing aboyand girl in
Honolii gulch, Hawaii. The girlclimbed abread-
fruit tree. Maui changed himself intoaneeland
stretched himself along theside ofthetrunk ofthe
tree.The treestretched itselfupward andMaui failed
toreach the girl.Apriest came along andstruck the
eeland killed it,andsoMaui died. This isevidently
achanged form ofthelegend ofMaui andthelong
eel.Another Hawaiian fragment approaches very near
tothebeautiful New Zealand myth. TheHawaiians
said thatMaui attempted totear amountain apart.
Hewrenched agreat hole intheside.Then theelc-
paio birdsangandthecharm wasbroken. The cleft
130


inthemountain could notbeenlarged. Ifthestory
could becompleted itwould notbestrange ifthe
death ofMaui came with this failure toopen the
paththrough themountain.
TheHervey Islands saythat afterMaui fished up
theislands hishookwasthrown intotheheavens and
became thecurved tailoftheconstellation ofstars
which weknow as"The Scorpion." Then thepeople
became angry withMaui andthrew himupinto the
skyand hisbody isstillthought tobehanging among
thestars ofthescorpion.
TheSamoans, according toTurner, saythatMaui
went fishing and tried tocatch thelandunder the
seasandpull ittothesurface. Finally anisland ap-
peared, butthepeople living on itwere angry with
Maui anddrove himiaway intotheheavens.
Asheleaped from theisland itseparated intotwo
parts. Thus theSamoans account fortheorigin of
two oftheir islands andalso forthepassing away of
Maui from theearth.
The natives ofNew Zealand havemany myths
concerning thedeath ofMaui. Each tribe tells the
story withsuch variations aswould beexpected when
thefact isnoted thatthese tribes have preserved their
individuality through many generations. The sub-
stance ofthemyth, however, isthesame.
InMaui's lastdays helonged forthevictory over
death. Hisinnate love oflifeledhim toface the
131


possibility ofescaping andovercoming- therelentless
enemy ofmankind andthusbestow theboon ofdeatli-
lessness upon hisfellow-men. Hehadbeen success-
fuloverandoveragain inhiscontests with bothgods
andmen.When manwas created, hestood erect,
but,according toanHawaiian myth, had jointless
armsandlimbs.Aweb ofskinconnected andfastened
tightly thearms tothebody and thelegs toeach
other. "Maui wasangry atthismotionless statue and
tookhimandbroke hislegs atankle, kneeandhip
andthen, tearing them andthearms from thebody,
destroyed theweb. Then hebroke thearms atthe
elbow and shoulder. Then man could move from
place toplace, buthehad neither fingers ortoes."
Herecomes themost ancient Polynesian statement of
thetheory ofevolution: "Hunger impelled man to
seek hisfood inthemountains, where histoeswere
cutoutbythebrambles inclimbing, and hisfingers
were alsoformed bythesharp splinters ofthebamboo
while searching with hisarms forfood intheground."
Itwasnotstrange thatMaui should feel self-con-
fident when considering thestruggle forimmortality
asagifttobebestowed upon mankind. And yethis
father warned him that histime offailure would
surely come.
White, who hascollected many ofthemyths and
legends ofNew Zealand, states that afterMaui had
ill-treated Mahu-ika, hisgrandmother, thegoddess
132


andguardian offire intheunder-world, hisfather
andmother tried toteach him tododifferently. But
herefused tolisten. Then thefather said:
"You heard our instructions, butplease yourself
andpersist for lifeordeath."
Maui replied: "What doIcare?Doyouthink I
shall cease? Rather Iwill persist forever andever."
Then hisfather said :"There isonesopowerful
thatnotricks canbeofany avail."
Maui asked: "Bywhat shall Ibeovercome?" The
answer was thatoneofhisancestors, Hine-nui-te-po
(Great Hine ofthenight), theguardian oflife,would
overcome him.
When IMaui fished islands outofthedeep seas, it
wassaidthatHinemade herhome ontheouter edge
ofoneoftheoutermost islands. There theglow of
thesetting sunlighted thethatch ofherhouse and
covered itwith glorious colors. There Great Hine
herself stood flashing andsparkling ontheedge of
thehorizon.
Maui, inthese lastdays ofhis life,looked toward
thewest and said: "Let usinvestigate thismatter
andlearn whether lifeordeath shall follow."
The father replied: "There isevilhanging over
you.When Ichanted theinvocation ofyour child-
hood, when youweremade sacred andguarded by
charms, Iforgot apart oftheceremony. And for
thisyou aretodie."
133


Then Maui said, "^^'ill thisbebyHine-nui-te-po?
What isslielike?"
The father said that theflashing eyes they could
seeinthedistance were dark asgreenstone, theteeth
were assharp asvolcanic glass, hermouth waslarge
likeafish,andherhairwas floating inthe airlike
sea-weed.
One ofthelegends ofNew Zealand says that ]\Iaui
and hisbrothers went toward thewest, totheedge
ofthehorizon, where theysaw thegoddess ofthe
night. Light wasflashing from herbody. Here they
found agreat pit—thehome ofnight. Maui entered
thepit—telling hisbrothers nottolaugh. Hepassed
through andturning about started toreturn. The
brothers laughed and thewalls ofnight closed in
around himandheldhim tillhedied.
Thelonger legend tellshowMaui after hisconver-
sation with hisfather, remembered hisconflict with
themoon. Hehad tiedhersothatshecould notes-
cape, butwascompelled tobathe inthewaters oflife
andreturn night after night lestmen should bein
darkness when evening came.
Maui said tothegoddess ofthemoon: "Let death
beshort. Asthemoon diesandreturns withnew
strength, soletmen dieandrevive again."
Butshereplied: "Let death bevery long, thatman
may sighandsorrow. When man dies, lethimgo
134


intodarkness, become likeearth, thatthose heleaves
behind mayweep andwailandmourn."
Maui didnotlayaside hispurpose, but,according
totheNew Zealand story, "did notwishmen todie,
but tolive forever. Death appeared degrading and
aninsult tothedignity ofman.Man ought todie
likethemoon, which dips inthelife-giving waters of
Kane and isrenewed again, orlikethesun,which
daily sinks into the pitofnight andwith renewed
strength rises inthemorning."
Maui sought thehome ofHine-nui-te-po —the
guardian oflife.Heheard herorder herattendants
towatch foranyoneapproaching andcapture all
whocame walking upright asaman. Hecrept past
theattendants onhands and feet,found theplace of
life, stolesome ofthefood ofthegoddess and re-
turned home. Heshowed thefood tohisbrothers
andpersuaded them togowithhim intothedarkness
ofthenight ofdeath. Onthewayhechanged them
into theform ofbirds. Intheevening theycame to
thehouse ofthegoddess ontheisland long before
fished upfrom theseas.
Maui warned thebirds torefrain frommaking any
noise while hemade thesupreme effort ofhis life.
Hewasabout toenter upon hisstruggle forimmor-
tality. Hesaid tothebirds :"IfIgointothestom-
ach ofthiswoman, donotlaugh until Ihave gone
135


through her,andcome outagain athermoutli ;then
youcanlaugh atme."
His friends said: "You willbekilled." Maui re-
plied: "Ifyoulaugh atmewhen Ihave only en-
tered herstomach Ishall bekilled, but ifIhave passed
through herandcome outofhermouth Ishall escape
andHine-nui-te-po will die."
Hisfriends called outtohim :"Go then. The de-
cision iswith you."
Hine was sleeping soundly. The flashes oflight-
ninghad allceased. The sunlight hadalmost passed
away andthehouse layinquiet gloom. ]\Iaui came
near tothesleeping goddess. Her large, fish-like
mouth wasopen wide. Heput offhisclothing and
prepared topassthrough theordeal ofgoing tothe
hidden source oflife, totear itoutofthebody ofits

Maui entered thegates ofdeath, butwasunable to

HINAOFHILO.
^V^INA isnotanuncommon name inHawaiian
Ww^genealogies. Itisusually accompanied by
^^ some adjective which explains oridentifies the
person towhom thename isgiven. InHawaii the
name Hina isfeminine. This isalso truethroughout
allPolynesia except inafew cases where Hina is
reckoned asamanwith supernatural attributes. Even
inthese cases itisapparent that thelegend hasbeen
changed from itsoriginal form asithasbeen carried
tosmall islands bycomparatively ignorant people
when moving away from their former homes.
Hina isaPolynesian goddess whose story isvery
interesting—oneworthy ofstudy when comparing
thelegends oftheisland groups ofthePacific. The
Hina ofHilo isthesame asthegoddess ofthatname
most widely known throughout Polynesia—andyet
herlegends arelocated bytheancient Hawaiians in
Hilo, as ifthat place were heronly home. The
139


legends aresooldthat theHawaiians have forgotten
their origin inother lands. The stories were brought
with theimmigrants who settled ontheHilo coast.
Thus thestories found their final location with the
families who brought them. There arethree Ha-
waiian Hinas practically distinct from each other, al-
though asupernatural element isconnected with each
one. Hinawhowas stolen from Hawaii byachief
oftheIsland ofMolokai wasanhistorical character,
although surrounded bymythical stories. Another
Hina,whowas thewife ofKuula, the fishgod,was
pre-eminently alocal deity, having norealconnection
with thelegends oftheother islands ofthePacific, al-
though sometimes the stories toldconcerning her
have notbeen kept entirely distinct from thelegends
oftheHina ofHilo.
The HiloHina was thetruelegendary character
closely connected with allPolynesia. The stories
about herareofvalue notsimply aslegends, butas
Traditions closely uniting theHawaiian Islands with
theisland groups thousands ofmiles distant. The
Wailuku river, which flows through thetown ofHilo,
has itsown peculiar andweird beauty. Formales it
isaseries ofwaterfalls and rapids. Itfollows the
course ofanancient lava flow,sometimes forcing its
wayunder bridges oflava, thus forming what are
called boiling pots, andsometimes pouring inmas-
sive sheets over theedges ofi)recipices which never
140


disintegrate. Bytheside ofthis river Hina's son
Maui had hislands. Intheverybedoftheriver, in
acaveunder oneofthelargest falls,Hinamade her
ownhome, concealed from thew^orld bythe silver
veil offalling water and lulled tosleep bythecon-
tinual roar oftheflood falling into thedeep pool be-
low.Bytheside ofthis river, thelegends say,she
pounded hertapaandprepared herfood. Here were
thesmall, graceful mamake and thecoarser wauke
trees, from which thebarkwasstripped withwhich
shemade tapa cloth. Branches were cutorbroken
from these andother treeswhose barkwas fitforthe
purpose. These branches were wellsoaked until the
barkwasremoved easily. Then theouter barkwas
scraped ofif,leaving only thepliable inner bark. The
dayswere very short andtherewasnotime forrest
while making tapa cloth. Therefore, assoon asthe
morning light reddened theclouds, Hina would take
hercalabash filled withwater topourupon thebark,
andher little bundle ofround clubs (thehohoa) and
herfour-sided mallets (the i-e-kuku) andhasten to
thesacred spotwhere, with chants andincantations,
thetapawasmade.
Thebarkwaswellsoaked inthewater allthedays
oftheprocess oftapamaking. Hina took small bun-
dles ofthewetinner barkand laidthem onthekua
orheavy tapa board, pounding them together into a
pulpy mass with herround clubs. Then using the
141


four-sided mallets, shebeat thispulp into thin sheets.
Beautiful tapa, softassilk,wasmade byadding pulpy
mass topulpy massandbeating itdayafterday until
thefibres were lostand asheet ofclose-woven bark
clothwasformed. Although Hinawas agoddess and
had afamily possessing miraculous power, itnever
entered themind oftheHawaiian legend tellers to
endow herwith ease inproducing wonderful results.
The legends oftheSouthern Pacific Islands show
more imagination. They saythat Ina(Hina) was
such awonderful artist inmaking beautiful tapas that
shewasplaced intheskies, where shebeat out glist-
ening finetapas, thewhite andglorious clouds. When
shestretches these clouds sheets out todry, she
places stones along theedges, sothat thefierce winds
oftheheavens shall notblowthem away. When she
throws these stones aside, theskies reverberate with
thunder. When she rolls hercloud sheets oftajia to-
gether, thefolds glisten with flashes oflightandlight-
ning leaps from sheet tosheet.
TheHina ofHilowas grieved asshe toiled be-
cause after shehadpounded thesheets outsothin
thattheywere ready tobedried, shefound italmost
impossible tosecure thenecessary aidofthesun in
thedrying process. Shewould riseassoon asshe
could seeandhasten tospread outthetapamade the
daybefore. Butthesunalways hurried sofastthat
thesheets could notdry.Heleaped from theocean
142


waters intheearth, rushed across theheavens and
plunged intothedarkwaters again ontheother side
oftheisland before shecould even turn hertapas so
that they might dryevenly. This legend ofvery
short days isstrange because ofitsplace notonly
among themyths ofHawaii butalsobecause itbe-
longs topractically allthetropical islands ofthe
Pacific Ocean. InTahiti thelegends said that the
sunrushed across theskyvery rapidly. Thedays
were tooshort forfruits toripen orforwork tobe
finished. InSamoa the"mats" made bySinahadno
time todry.Theancestors ofthePolynesians some-
timesomewhere must havebeen intheregion ofshort
daysandlong nights. Hina found thatherincanta-
tions hadnoinfluence with thesun. Shecould not
prevail uponhim togoslower andgivehermore time
forthecompletion ofhertask. Then shecalled on
herpowerful son, Maui-ki-i-ki-i, foraid.
Some ofthelegends oftheIsland Maui saythat
Hina dwelt bytheseacoast ofthat island near the
high hillKauwiki atthefoot ofthegreat mountain
Haleakala, House oftheSun,andthat there, facing
thesouthern skies under themost favorable condi-
tions formaking tapa, shefound thedays tooshort
forthetapa todry.Atthepresent time theHawaiians
point outalong, narrow stone notfarfrom thesurf
andalmost below thecaves inwhich thegreat queen
Kaahumanu spent theearliest days ofherchildhood.
143


This stone issaid tobethekuaortapa board on
Avhicli Hina pounded thebark forher cloth. Other
legends ofthatsame island locate Hina's home on
thenortheast coast near Pohakuloa.
TheHilo legends, however, donotdeem itneces-
sary thatHina andMaui should have theirhome
across thewide channel which divides theIsland Ha-
waiifrom theIsland Maui inorder towage war suc-
cessfully with theinconsiderate sun. Hina remained
inherhome bytheW'ailuku river, sometimes resting
inhercaveunder Rainbow Falls, andsometimes work-
ingontheriver bank, trusting herpowerful sonMaui
tomake the swiftly-passing lord ofdaygomore
slowly.
Maui possessed many supernatural j^owers. He
could assume theform ofbirds orinsects. Hecould
callonthewinds todohiswill, orhecould, ifhe
wished, traverse miles with asingle stride. Itisin-
teresting tonote that theHilolegends differ astothe
way inwdiich Ma-ui theman passed over toMau-i
theisland. Onelegend says thathecrossed thechan-
nel,miles wide, with asingle step. Another saysthat
helaunched hiscanoe andwith abreath thegod of
thewinds placed himontheopposite coast, while
another story says thatMaui assumed theform ofa
white chicken, which flewover thewaters toHale-
akala. Here hetook ropes made from the fibre of
trees andvines andlassoed thesunwhile itclimbed
144


theside ofthemountain andentered thegreat crater
which hollows outthesummit. Thesuncame through
alarge gap intheeastern side ofthecrater, rushing
along asrapidly aspossible. Then Maui threw his
lassoes one after theother over thesun's legs (the
rays oflight), holding him fast»ndbreaking offsome
ofthem. With amagic clubMaui struck theface of
thesunagain andagain. Atlast,wounded andweary,
andalsolimping onitsbroken legs, thesunpromised
Maui togoslowly forevermore.
"La"among thePolynesians, liketheword "Ra"
among theEgyptians, means "sun" or"day" or"sun-
god"—andthemountain where thesonofHinawon
hisvictory over themonster oftheheavens haslong
borne thename Hale-a-ka-la, orHouse oftheSun.
Hina ofHilo soon realized thewonderful deed
which Maui haddone. Shespread outherfinetapas
with songs ofjoyand cheerily performed thetask
which filled thehours oftheday.Thecomfort ofsun-
shine andcooling winds came with great power into
Hina's life,bringing toherrenewed joyandbeauty.

XIII.
HINAANDTHEWAILUKU RIVER.
^^rHERE aretwo rivers ofrushing, tumbling rapids
ill and waterfalls intheHawaiian Islands, both^^ bearing thename ofWailuku. One isonthe
Island ofMaui, flowing outofadeep gorge inthe
side oftheextinct volcano lao. Yosemite-like preci-
pices surround this majestically-walled crater. The
name laomeans "asking forclouds." Thehead of
thecrater-valley isalmost always covered with great
masses ofheavy rain clouds. Out ofthecrater the
massed waters rush inaswift-flowing stream< ofonly
fourorfivemiles, emptying intoKahului harbor. The
other Wailuku river isontheIsland ofHawaii. The
snows meltonthesummits ofthetwogreat moun-
tains,Mauna KeaandMauna Loa. Thewater seeps
through theporous lavafrom theeastern slope of
Mauna Loaand thesouthern slope ofMauna Kea,
meeting where thelava flows ofcenturies from each
mountain have piled upagainst each other. Through

thefragments ofthese volcanic battles thewaters
creepdown themountain sidetoward thesea.
Atoneplace, anumber ofmiles above thecity of
Hilo, thewaters were heard gurgling andsplashing
farbelow thesurface. Water wasneeded forthe
sugar plantations, which modern energy hasestab-
lished allalong theeastern coast ofthelarge island.
Atunnel was cutinto the lava, theunderground
stream wastapped—andanabundant supply ofwater
secured and sluiced down tothelarge plantations
below. Thehead waters oftheWailuku river gath-
eredfrom themelting snow ofthemountains found
these channels, which centered atlast inthebedofa
very ancient andvery interesting lava flow. Some-
times breaking forth inalarge, turbulent flood, the
stream forces itswayoverandaround thehuge blocks
oflavawhich mark thecourse oftheeruption oflong
ago. Sometimes itcourses inatunnel leftbythe
flowing lavaandcomes upfrombelow inaseries of
boiling pools. Then again itfalls inmajestic sheets
over high walls ofworn precipices. Several large
fallsandsome very picturesque smaller cascades in-
terspersed with rapids and natural bridges give to
this river abeauty peculiarly itsown. Themost
weird ofalltherough places through which theWai-
luku river flows isthatknown asthebasin ofRain-
bow Falls near Hilo. Here Hina, themoon goddess
ofthePolynesians, lived inagreat open cave, over
147


which the fallshung their misty, rainbow-tinted veil.
Herson Alaui, themighty demi-god ofPolynesia,
supposed bysome writers tobethesun-god ofthe
Polynesians, hadextensive lands along thenorthern
bank ofthe river. Hereamong hiscultivated fields
hehad hishome, fromwhich hewent forth toaccom-
plish thewonders attributed tohim inthelegends of
theHawaiians.
Below thecave inwhich Ilina dwelt the river
fought itswaythrough anarrow gorge and then, in
aseries ofmany small falls, descended tothe little
bay,where itswaters mingled with thesurf ofthe
salt sea. Farabove thecave, inthebedoftheriver,
dwelt Kuna. The district through which that por-
tion oftheriver runs bears tothisday thename
"Wai-kuna" or"Kuna's river." When thewriter was
talking with thenatives concerning thispart ofthe
oldlegend, they said"Kuna isnotaHawaiian word.
Itmeans something likeasnake oradragon, some-
thingwedonothave inthese islands." This, they
thought, made theconnection with theHina legend
valueless until theywereshown thatTuna (orkuna)
wastheNewZealand name ofareptile which attack-
edHina andstruck herwith his taillikeacrocodile,
forwhich Maui killed him.When thiswasunder-
stood, theHawaiians were greatly interested togive
theremainder ofthislegend andcompare itwith the
New Zealand story. InNew Zealand there aresev-
148


eralstatements concerning Tuna's dwelling place.He
issometimes represented ascombing from apool to
attack Hina andsometimes from adistant stream, and
sometimes from theriverbywhich Hina dwelt. The
Hawaiians told oftheannoyances which Hina en-
dured fromKuna while helived above herhome in
theWailuku. Hewould stopuptheriver and fill
itwith dirt aswhen thefreshets brought down the
debris ofthestorms from themountain sides. He
would throw logsand rolling stones intothestream
thattheymight becarried over the fallsanddrive
Hina from hercave. Hehadsought Hina inmany
ways andhadbeen repulsed again andagain until at
lasthatred took theplace ofallmore kindly feelings
andhedetermined todestroy thedivine chiefess.
Hinawasfrequently leftwith but little protection,
andyetfrom herhome inthecave feared nothing that
Kuna could do.Precipices guarded thecaveoneither
side,andanyapproach ofanenemy through the fall-
ingwater could beeasily thwarted. Soherchants
rang outthrough theriver valley even while floods
swirled around her,andKuna's missiles were falling
over therocky bed ofthestream toward her.Kuna
became very angry and, uttering great curses and
calling upon allhismagic forces toaidhim,caught a
great stone and atnight hurled itinto thegorge of
theriverbelow Hina's home, filling theriverbedfrom
bank tobank. "Ah,Hina !Now isthedanger, for
149


theriver rises. Thewater cannot flowaway. Awake!
Awake!"
Hina isnotaware ofthis evilwhich issonear.The
water rises and rises, higher and higher. "Auwe!
Auwe! Alas, alas,Hina must perish!" Thewater
entered theopening ofthecaveandbegan tocreep
along the floor. Hina cannot fly,except intothevery
arms ofhergreat enemy, who iswaiting todestroy
her.Then Hina called forMaui. Again andagain
hervoice went outfrom thecave. Itpierced through
thestorms andtheclouds which attended Kuna's at-
tackupon her. Itswept along theside ofthegreat
mountain. Itcrossed thechannel between theislands
ofHawaii andMaui. Itsanguish smote theside of
thegreat mountain Haleakala. where Maui hadbeen
throwing hislassoes around thesunandcomi)elling
him.' togomore slowly. When Maui heard Hina's
cry forhelp echoing from cliff to cliff'andthrough
theravines, heleaped atonce torush toherassistance.
Some saythatHina. thegoddess, hadacloud ser-
vant, the"ao-opua," the"warning cloud." which ro.se
swiftly above the falls wdien Hina cried foraidand
then,assuming apeculiar shape, stood highabove the
hills thatMaui might see it.Down themountain he
leaped tohismagic canoe. Pushing itinto thesea
withtwomighty strokes ofhispaddle hecrossed the
seatothemouth oftheWailuku river. Here even to
thepresent day liesalong double rock, surrounded

bythewaters ofthebay,which thenatives callKa
waa oMaui, "The canoe ofMaui." Itrepresents to
Hawaiian thought themagic canoe withwhich Maui
always sailed over theocean more swiftly thanany
winds could carry him. Leaving hiscanoe, Maui
seized themagic clubwithwhich hehadconquered
thesun after lassoing him,andrushed along thedry
bedoftheriver totheplace ofdanger. Swinging the
club swiftly around hishead, hestruck thedam hold-
ingback thewater oftherapidly-rising river.
"Ah !Nothing canwithstand themagic club. The
bank around oneendofthedam gives way.Theim-
prisoned waters leap into thenew channel. Safe is
Hina thegoddess."
Kuna heard thecrash oftheclubagainst thestones
oftheriverbankand fleduptheriver tohishome in
thehidden caves bythepools intheriver bed.Maui
rushed uptheriver topunish Kuna-mo-o forthe
trouble hehadcaused Hina. When hecam^e tothe
placewhere thedragon washidden under deep waters,
hetook hismagic spear andthrust itthrough thedirt
andlavarocks along oneside oftheriver, making a
long hole,through which thewaters rushed, revealing
Kuna-mo-o's hiding place. This place ofthespear
thrust isknown among theHawaiians asKapuka
aMaui, "the doormade byMaui." Itisalsoknown
as"The natural bridge oftheWailuku river."
Kuna-mo-o fled tohisdifferent hiding places, but
151


Maui broke uptheriver bedanddrove thedragon
outfrom every one,following himfrom place toplace
ashefleddown theriver. Apparently this isalegend-
aryaccount ofearthquakes. AtlastKuna-mo-o found
what seemed tobeasafehiding place inaseries of
deep pools, butMaui poured alavaflow intotheriver.
Hethrew red-hot burning stones intothewater until
thepools were boiling and thesteam was rising in
clouds. Kuna uttered incantation after incantation,
butthewater scalded andburned him. Dragon as
hewas, hishard, tough skinwas ofnoavail. The
painwasbecoming unbearable. With cries tohis
gods heleaped from thepools and fleddown theriver.
Thewaters ofthepools arenolonger scalding, but
theyhave never lostthetumbling, tossing, foaming,
boiling swirl which Maui gave tothemwhen he
threw intothem thered-hot stones withwhich he
hoped todestroy Kuna, andthey areknown today as
"The Boiling Pots."
Scrr^e versions ofthelegend saythatMaui poured
boiling water intheriverandsent itinswift pursuit
ofKuna, driving himfrom point topoint andscalding
his lifeoutofhim. Others saythatMaui chased the
dragon, striking himagain andagain with hisconse-
crated weapons, following Kuna down from falls to
falls until hecame totheplace where Hina dwelt.
Then, feeling that there was little useinflight, Kuna
battled with Maui. Hisstruggles were ofnoavail.
152


Hewasforced over the falls into thestream below.
Hina and herwomen encouraged Maui bytheir
chants andstrengthened himbythemost powerful
incantations withwhich theywere acquainted. Great
was their joywhen they beheld Kuna's ponderous
body hurled over the falls. Eagerly theywatched the
dragon astheswift waters swept himagainst thedam
withwhich hehadhoped todestroy Hina; andwhen
thewhirling waves caught himanddashed him
through thenewchannel made byMaui's magic club,
they rejoiced andsang thepraise ofthemdghty war-
riorwhohadsaved them. Maui hadrushed along the
bank oftheriver with tremendous strides overtak-
ingthedragon ashewas rolled overandoveramong
thesmall waterfalls near themouth oftheriver. Here
Maui again attacked Kuna, atlastbeating the lifeout
ofhisbody. "Moo-Kuna" wasthename given bythe
Hawaiians tothedragon. "Moo" means anything in
lizard shape, butKuna was unlike any lizard known
intheHawaiian Islands. MooKuna isthename
sometimes given toalong black stone lying likean
island inthewaters between thesmall falls ofthe
river. Asonewho calls attention tothislegendary
black stone says :"As ifhewere notdeadenough al-
ready, every bigfreshet inthestream beats himand
pounds himanddrowns himover andover ashe
would havedrowned Hina." ANew Zealand legend
relates aconflict ofincantations, somewhat likethe
153


filling inoftheW'ailuku river byKuna, and the
cleaving ofanewchannel byMaui with thedifferent
useofmeans. InNew Zealand theriver isclosed by
theuseofpowerful incantations andcharms and re-
opened bytheuseofthose more powerful.
IntheHervey Islands, Tuna, thegodofeels,loved
Ina(Hina) and finally died forher,giving hishead
tobeburied. Fromi thishead sprang twococoanut
trees, bearing fruitmarked with Tuna's eyes and
mouth.
InSamoa thebattle wasbetween anowland a
serpent. Theowlconquered bycalling intheaidof
afriend.
This story ofHina apparently goes farback inthe
traditions ofPolynesians, even totheir ancient home
inHawaiki, from which itwastaken byonebranch
ofthefamily toNew Zealand andbyanother tothe
Hawaiian Islands and other groups inthe Pacific
Ocean. Thedragon mayeven bearemembrance of
thedayswhen thePolynesians weresupposed todwell
bythebanks oftheRiver Ganges inIndia, when croc-
odiles were dangerous enemies andheroes saved fam-
iliesfrom their destructive depredations.

GHOSTS OFTHEHILO HILLS.
^yrHE legends about Hinaandherfamous sonMaui
ifIandherlesswidely known daughters arecom-^^ nion property among thenatives ofthebeau-
tiful little city ofHilo. One ofthese legends ofmore
than ordinary interest finds itslocation inthethree
small hillsback ofHilotoward themountains.
These hills aresmall craters connected withsome
ancient lava flow ofunusual violence. Theeruption
must have started farupontheslopes ofMauna Loa.
As itspeddown toward thesea itmetsome obstruc-
tionwhich, although overwhelmed, checked theflow
andcaused agreat mass ofcinders andashes tobe
thrown outuntil alarge hillwith ahollow crater was
built up,covering many acres ofground.
Soon thelavafound another ventandthenanother
obstruction andasecond andthen athird hillwere
formed nearer thesea.These hills orextinct craters
bear thenames Halai, Opeapea andPuuHonu. They
155


arenot farfrom theWailuku river, famous for its
picturesque waterfalls andalso forthelegends which
aretoldalong itsbanks. Here Maui had hislands
overlooking thesteep bluflFs. Here inacave under
theRainbow Fallswasthehome ofHina, themother
ofMaui, according totheHawaiian stories. Other
parts ofthePacific sometimes make Hina Maui's wife,
andsometimes agoddess fromwhom hedescended.
IntheSouth Sealegends Hinawasthought tohave
married themoon. Herheme was intheskies, where
shewove beautiful tapa cloths (the clouds), which
were bright and glistening, sothatwhen sherolled
them upflashes oflight (cloud lightning) could be
seenontheearth. She laidheavy stones onthecor-
ners ofthese tapas, butsometimes thestones rolled
ofifandmade thethunder. Hina oftheRainbow Falls
wasafamous tapamaker whose tapawasthecause of
Maui's conflict with thesun.
Hina hadseveral daughters, four ofwhose names
aregiven: HinaKeAhi,HinaKeKai,Hina Ma-
huia, andHina Kuluua. Eachname marked thepe-
culiar "mana" ordivine giftwhich Hina, themother,
hadbestowed upon herdaughters.
HinaKeAhimeant theHinawhohadcontrol of
fire. Thisname issometimes given toHina the
mother. HinaKeKaiwas thedaughter whohad
power over thesea. Shewas said tohave been ina
canoe with herbrother Mauiwhen hefished upCo-
156


coanut Island, hislinebreaking before hecould pull
ituptothemainland andmake itfast. HinaKuluua
wasthemistress over theforces ofrain. Thewinds
andthestorms were supposed toobey herwill. Hina
Mahuia ispeculiarly aname connected with thelegends
oftheother island groups ofthePacific. Mahuia or
Mafuie wasagodorgoddess offire allthrough Poly-
nesia.
Thelegend oftheHilo hills pertains especially to
HinaKeAhiandHina Kuluua. Hina themother
gave the hillHalai toHinaKeAhiandthe hillPuu
Honu toHina Kuluua for their families and de-
pendents.
The hillswere ofrich soilandtherewasmuch rain.
Therefore, foralong time, thetwodaughters had
plenty offood forthemselves andtheir people, butat
lastthedayswere like fireandtheskyhadnorain in
it.The taroplanted onthehillsides died. The ba-
nanas andsugar cane andsweet potatoes withered
andthe fruitonthetreeswas blasted. Thepeople
were faintbecause ofhunger, andtheshadow ofdeath
wasover theland. HinaKeAhi pitied hersuffering
friends anddetermined toprovide food forthem.
Slowly herpeople labored athercommand. Over
theywent tothebanks oftheriver course, which was
only thebed ofanancient lava stream, overwhich
nowater was flowing; thefamished laborers toiled,
gathering andcarrying back whatever wood they
157


could find,thenupthemountain side tothegreat koa
andohia forests, gathering their burdens offuel ac-
cording tothewishes oftheir chiefess.
Their sorcerers planted charms along thewayand
uttered incantations toward offthedanger offailure.
The priests ofTered sacrifices andprayers forthesafe
and successful return oftheburden-bearers. After
man}' days thegreat quantity ofwood desired bythe
goddess was piled upbytheside oftheHalai Hill.
Thencame thedays ofdigging outthehillandmak-
ingagreat imu orcooking oven andpreparing it
with stones andwood. Large quantities ofwood were
thrown into theplace. Stones best fitted forretain-
ingheatwere gathered andthe fires kindled. When
thestones were hot,HinaKeAhidirected thepeople
toarrange theimu initsproper order forcooking the
materials foragreat feast.Aplace wasmade for
sweet potatoes, another fortaro, another forpigsand
another fordogs. Alltheform ofpreparing thefood
forcooking waspassed through, butnorealfoodwas
laidonthestones. Then Hina toldthem tomake a
place intheimu forahuman sacrifice. Probably out
ofevery imu ofthelongagoasmall part ofthefood
was offered tothegods, andtheremayhave been a
special place intheimu forthat part ofthefood to
becooked. Atany rateHina had thisoven sobuilt
thatthepeople understood that aremarkable sacrifice
l.=^8


would beoffered inittothegods,who forsome rea-
sonhadsent thefamine upon thepeople.
Human sacrifices were frequently offered bythe
Hawaiians even after thedays ofthecoming ofCap-
tainCook,Adeadbodywassupposed tobeaccept-
able tothegodswhen achief's house was built,when
achief's newcanoe was tobemade orwhen temple
walls were tobeerected orvictories celebrated. The
bodies ofthepeople belonged tothewill ofthechief.
Therefore itwas inquiet despair that theworkmen
obeyed HinaKeAhiandprepared theplace forsac-
rifice. Itmight mean theirownholocaust asanoffer-
ingtothegods. AtlastHinaKeAhibade the la-
borers cease theirwork andstand bytheside ofthe
oven ready tocover itwith thedirtwhich hadbeen
thrown outandpiledupbytheside.Thepeople stood
by,notknowing uponwhom^ theblow might fall.
ButHinaKeAhiwas"Hina thekind," and al-
though shestood before them robed inroyal majesty
andpower, stillherfacewas fullofpityand love.
Her voice melted thehearts ofherretainers asshe
badethem carefully follow herdirections.
"Omypeople. Where areyou? Willyouobey
anddoasIcommand? Thisimu ismyimu. Ishall
liedown onitsbedofburning stones. Ishall sleep
under itscover. Butdeeply covermeorImay
perish. Quickly throw thedirtovermybody. Fear
159


notthe fire.Watch forthree days.Awoman will
stand bytheimu.Obey herwill."
HinaKeAhiwas very beautiful, and hereyes
flashed light like fireasshestepped intothegreat pit
andlaydown ontheburning stones. Agreatsmoke
arose andgathered over theimu. Themen toiled
rapidly, placing theimumats over their chiefess and
throwing thedirtback intotheoven until itwas all
thoroughly covered andthesmoke wasquenched.
Then theywaited forthestrange, mysterious thing
which must follow thesacrifice ofthisdivine chiefess.
Halai hilltrembled andearthquakes shook theland
round about. The great heat ofthe fire intheimu
withered the little lifewhich was still leftfrom the
famine. Meanwhile HinaKeAhiwascarrying out
herplan forsecuring aidforherpeople. Shecould
notbeinjured bytheheat forshewas agoddess of
fire.Thewaves ofheatraged around herasshesank
down through thestones oftheimu into theunder-
ground paths which belonged tothe spirit world.
Thelegend says thatHinamade herappearance in
theform ofagushing stream ofwater which would
always supply thewant ofheradherents. Thesecond
daypassed. Hinawas stilljourneying underground,
butthistime shecame tothesurface asapoolnamed
MoeWaa (canoe sleep) much nearer thesea.The
third daycame andHina caused agreat spring of
sweet water toburst forth from theseashore inthe
160


very path oftheocean surf. This received thename
Auauwai. Here Hinawashed away alltraces ofher
journey through thedepths. Thiswasthelastofthe
series ofearthquakes and theappearance ofnew
water springs. Thepeople waited, feeling that som^e
more wonderful event must follow theremarkable
experiences ofthethree days. Soon awoman stood
bytheimu,whocommanded thelaborers todigaway
thedirtandremove themats.When thiswasdone,
thehungry people found avery great abundance of
food, enough tosupply theirwant until thefood
plants should have time toripen andthedays ofthe
famine should beover.
Thejoyofthepeople wasgreatwhen theyknew
that their chiefess hadescaped death andwould still
dwellamong them incomfort. Many were thesongs
sung and stories toldabout thegreat famine andthe
success ofthegoddess offire.
The second sister, Hina Kuluua, thegoddess of
rain,wasalways very jealous ofherbeautiful sister
HinaKeAhi,andmany times sent rain toputout
fireswhich hersister tried tokindle. HinaKeAhi
could notstand therainandsofledwith herpeople
toahome bytheseaside.
Hina Kuluua (orHina Kuliua asshewassome-
tim'csknown among theHawaiians) could control rain
andstorms, butforsome reason failed toprovide a
food supply forherpeople, andthefamine wrought
161


havoc among them. Shethought ofthestories told
andsongs sung about her sister andwished forthe
same honor forherself. Shecommanded herpeople
tomake agreat imu forher inthe hillPuuHonu.
Sheknew that astrange power belonged toherand
yet, blinded byjealousy, forgot that rainand fire
could notwork together. Sheplanned tofurnish a
great supply offood forherjDcople inthesameway
inwhich hersister hadworked.
Theovenwasdug. Stones andwood w-ere collected
andthesame ghostly array ofpotatoes, taro, pigand
dogprepared ashadbeen done before byher sister.
Thekahunas orpriests knew thatHinaKuluua was
going outofherprovince intrying todoashersister
haddone, butthere was nouse inattcm])ting to
change herplans. Jealousy isself-willed and obsti-
nateandnoamount ofreasoning from herdependents
could haveanyinfluence over her.
Theordinary incantations were observed, andHina
Kuluua gave thesame directions asthose her sister
had given. Theimuwas tobe\vell heated. The
make-believe foodwas tobeput inand aplace left
forherbody. Itwas thegoddess ofrainmaking
ready toliedown onabedprepared forthegoddess
offire.When allwas ready, shelaydown onthe
heated stones andtheoven mats were thrown over
herandtheghostly provisions. Then thecovering of
dirtwasthrown back upon themats and heated

stones, filling thepitwhich hadbeen dug.Thegod-
dess ofrainwas lefttoprepare afeast forherpeople
asthegoddess offirehaddone forherfollowers.
Some ofthelegends have introduced thedemi-god
Maui into thisstory. Thenatives saythatMauicame
to*'burn" or"cook therain" andthathemade the
oven very hot,butthat thegoddess ofrainescaped
andhung over the hill intheform ofacloud. At
least this iswhat thepeople saw—notacloud of
smoke over theimu, butarain cloud. They waited
andwatched forsuch evidences ofunderground labor
asattended thepassage ofHinaKeAhithrough the
earth from the hilltothesea,buttheonly strange
appearance was thedark rain cloud. They waited
three daysandlooked fortheir chiefess tocome in
theform ofawoman. They waited another dayand
stillanother andnosigns orwonders were m-anifest.
Meanwhile Maui, changing himself into awhite bird,
flewupintotheskytocatch theghost ofthegoddess
ofrainwhich hadescaped from theburning oven.
Having caught this spirit, herolled itinsome kapa
cloth which hekept forfood tobeplaced inanoven
andcarried ittoaplace intheforest onthemountain
sidewhere again theattempt wasmade to"burn the
rain," butagreat drop escaped andspedupward into
thesky.Again Maui caught theghost ofthegoddess
andcarried ittoapaliorprecipice below thegreat
volcano Kilauea, where heagain tried todestroy itin
163


theheat ofagreat lavaoven, butthistime thespirit
escaped andfound asafe refuge among kukui trees
onthemountain side,fromwhich shesometimes rises
inclouds which thenatives sayarethesure sign of

Whether thisMaui legend hasany realconnection
vith thetwoHinas andthefamine wedonotsurely
know. The legend ordinarily toldamong theHa-
waiians says that after fivedays hadpassed the re-
tainers decided ontheir ov/n responsibility toopen the
imu.Xowoman hadappeared togivethem direc-
tions. Nothing butamysterious raincloud over the
hill. Indoubt and fear, thedirtwasthrown ofTand
themats removed. Nothing wasfound buttheashes
ofHina Kuluua. There wasnofood forherfollowers
andthegoddess had lost allpower ofappearing asa
chiefess. Her bitter andthoughtless jealousy brought
destruction upon herself andherpeople. Theghosts
of?IinaKeAhiand Ilina Kuluua sometimes draw
near totheold hills intheform ofthe fireofflowing
lava orclouds ofrainwhile theoldmenandwomen
tellthestory oftheHinas, thesisters ofMaui,who
were laidupon theburning stones oftheimus ofa

XV.
HINA,THEWOMAN INTHEMOON.
*T^HEWailuku river hasbyitsbanks farupthe
/Imountain sidesome ofthemost ancient ofthe^^ various interesting picture rocks oftheHa-
waiian Islands. The origin oftheHawaiian picture
writing isaproblem stillunsolved, butthepicture
rocks oftheWailuku river arecalled "na kiioMaui,"
"theMaui pictures." Their antiquity isbeyond ques-
tion.
Themost prominent figure cut inthese rocks is
that ofthecrescent moon. TheHawaiian legends do
notattempt any direct explanation ofthemeaning of
this picture writing. The traditions ofthePolyne-
sians both concerning Hina andMaui look toHina
asthemoon goddess oftheir ancestors, and insome
measure theHawaiian stories confirm thetraditions
oftheother island groups ofthe Pacific.
Fornander, inhishistory ofthePolynesian race,
gives theHawaiian story ofHina's ascent tothe
165


moon, butapplies ittoaHina thewife ofachief
called Aikanaka rather than totheHina ofHilo, the
wife ofAkalana. thefather ofMaui. However, For-
nander evidently found some difficulty indetermining
thestatus oftheone towhom herefers thelegend,
forhecalls her '"the mysterious wife ofAikanaka."
Insome oftheHawaiian legends Hina, themother
ofMaui, lived onthesoutheast coast oftheIsland
Maui atthefoot ofahillfamous inHawaiian story
asKauiki. Fornander says that this"mysterious
wife" ofAikanaka bore herchildren Puna andHuna,
thelatter anoted sea-rover among thePolynesians,
atthefoot ofthis hillKauiki. Itcanvery easily be
supposed that alegend oftheHina connected with
thedemi-god Maui might begiven during thecourse
ofcenturies totheother Hina, themother ofHuna.
The application ofthelegend would make nodiffer-
ence toanyone were itnotforthefactthat thestory
ofHina andherascent tothemoon hasbeenhanded
down indifferent forms among the traditions of
Samoa, New Zealand, Tonga, Hervey Islands, Fate
Islands, Nauru andother Pacific island groups. The
Polynesian name ofthemoon, Mahina orMasina, is
derived from Plina, thegoddess mother ofMaui. It
iseven possible totrace thename back to"Sin," the
moon god oftheAssyrians.
Themoon goddess ofPonape was Ina-maram.
(Hawaiian Hina-malamalama), "Hina giving light."
166


InthePaumotan Islands aneclipse ofthesun is
called Higa-higa-hana (Hina-hiua-hana), "The act
(hana) ofHina—themoon."
InNewZealand moonless nights were called "Dark
Hina."
InTahiti itissaid therewaswaramong thegods.
They cursed the stars. Hina saved them, although
they lostalittle light. Then they cursed thesea,but
Hina preserved the tides. They cursed the rivers,
butHina saved thesprings—themoving waters in-
land, likethetides intheocean.
TheHawaiians saythat Hina andhermaidens
pounded outthesoftest, finest kapa cloth onthelong,
thick kapa board atthefoot ofKauiki. Incessantly
therestless seadashed itsspray over thepicturesque
groups ofsplintered lavarocks which form theKauiki
headland. Here above thereach ofthesurf still lies
thelong, black stone intowhich thelegends say
Hina's kapa board waschanged. Here Hina took
theleaves ofthehala treeand, after themanner of
theHawaiian women oftheages past, braided mats
forthehousehold tosleep upon, andfrom thenuts
ofthekukui trees fashioned thetorches which were
burned around thehomes ofthose ofhigh chief rank.
Atlastshebecame weary ofherworkamong mor-
tals.Herfamily hadbecome more andmore trouble-
some. Itwassaid thathersonswere unruly andher
husband lazyand shiftless. She looked into the
167


heavens anddetermined tofleeupthepathway of
herrainbow through theclouds.
TheSunwasvery bright andHina said, "Iwillgo
totheSun." Soshe leftherhome very early inthe
morning andclimbed up,higher, higher, until the
heat oftherays ofthesunbeatstrongly upon herand
weakened hersothatshecould scarcely crawd along
herbeautiful path.Upalittle higher andtheclouds
nolonger gave hereven theleast shadow. Theheat
from thesunwassogreat thatshebegan tofeelthe
fireshriveling andtorturing her. Quickly sheslipped
down into thestorms around herrainbow andthen
back toearth. Asthedaypassed herstrength came
back, andwhen the fullmoon rose through the
shadows ofthenight shesaid, "Iwill clim^b tothe
moon andthere find rest."
Butwhen Hina began togoupward herhusband
saw herand called toher:"Do notgointo the
heavens." Sheanswered him:"Mymind isfixed; I
willgotomynewhusband, themoon." And she
climbed uphigher andhigher. Herhusband ran to-
ward her.Shewasalmost outofreach, butheleaped
andcaught her foot. This didnotdeter Hina from
herpurpose. Sheshook oflfherhusband, butashefell
hebroke herlegsothat thelower partcame oflfinhis
hands. Hina went upthrough thestars, crying out
thestrongest incantations shecould use.Thepowers
ofthenight aided her. The mysterious hands of
168


darkness lifted her, until shestood atthedoor ofthe
moon. Shehadpacked hercalabash with hermost
priceless possessions andhadcarried itwith hereven
when injured byhercruel husband. With hercala-
bash shelimped intothemoon andfound herabiding
home. When themoon isfull, theHawaiians ofthe
long ago, ayeandeven today, look into the quiet,
silvery lightandseethegoddess inhercelestial home,
hercalabash byher side.
The natives callhernowLono-moku, "the crippled
Lono." From thiswatch tower intheheavens she
pointed outtoKahai, oneofherdescendents, theway
toriseupintotheskies. Theancient chant thus de-
scribes hisascent:
"The rainbow istliepath ofKahai.
Kahai rose. Kahai bestirred himself.
Kahai passed onthefloating cloud ofKane,
Perplexed were theeyes ofAlihi.
Kahai passed onontheglancing light.
Theglancing light onmenand canoes.
Above wasHanaiakamalama." (Hina).
Thus under thecare ofhisancestress Hina, Kahai,
thegreat sea-rover, made hisascent inquest ofad-
ventures among theimmortals.
IntheTongan Islands thelegends saythatHina
remains inthemoon watching over the"fire-walkers"
astheir great protecting goddess.
169


TheHervey Island traditions saythat theMoon
(Marama) hadoften seenHina andadmired her,and
atlasthadcomedown andcaught heruptolivewith
himself. Themoonlight initsglory iscalled Ina-
motea, "the brightness ofIna."
The story astoldonAtiu Island (one oftheSo-
ciety group) isthatHina took herhuman husband
with hertothemoon, where theydwelt happily fora
time, butashegrew oldsheprepared arainbow, down
which hedescended totheearth todie,leaving Hina
forevermore as"thewoman inthemoon." The
Savage Islanders worshiped the spirits oftheir an-
cestors, saying thatmany ofthem went uptothe
land ofSina, thealways bright land intheskies. To
thenatives ofNine Island, Hina hasbeen thegod-
dess ruling over alltapamaking. They saythather
home is"Motu aHina," "the island ofHina," the
home ofthedead intheskies.
TheSamoans saidthattheMoon received Hina and
achild, andalsohertapaboard andmallet andmate-
rial forthemanufacture oftapa cloth. Therefore,
when themoon isshining infullsplendor, theyshade
their eyesandlook forthegoddess andthetools with
which shefashions thetapa clouds intheheavens.
TheXcwZealand legend says that thewoman went
after water inthenight. Asshepassed down the
j)ath tothespring thebright light ofthe fullmoon
made thewayeasy forherquick footsteps, butwhen
170


shehad filled hercalabash and started homeward,
suddenly thebright lightwashidden byapassing
cloud andshestumbled against astone inthepath
and felltotheground, spilling thewater shewas car-
rying. Then shebecame veryangry andcursed the
moon heartily. Then themoon became angry and
swiftly swept down upon herfrom theskies, grasp-
ingherand lifting herup.Inherterrible fight she
caught asmall treewith onehand andhercalabash
with theother. Butoh !thestrong moon pulled her
upwith thetreeandthecalabash andthere inthe
fullmoon theycan allbetraced when thenights are
clear.
Pleasant orNauru Island, inwhich amissionary
from Central Union Church, Honolulu, islaboring,
tells thestory ofGigu, abeautiful young woman, who
hasmany oftheexperiences ofHina. Sheopened the
eyes oftheMother oftheMoon asHina, insome of
thePolynesian legends, isrepresented tohaveopened
theeyes ofoneofthegreat goddesses, and inreward
ismarried toMaraman, theMoon, withwhom she
lives ever after, andinwhose embrace shecanalways
beseenAvhen themoon isfull. Gigu isHina under
another andmore guttural form ofspeech. Maraman
isthesame asMalama, oneofthePolynesian names
forthemoon.
