INTRODUCTION
The legends oftheHawaiian Islands areas
diverse asthose ofanycountry intheworld.
They are also entirely distinct inform and
thought from thefairy-tales which excite the
interest andwonder oftheEnglish andGerman
children. Themythology ofHawaii follows the
lawsupon which allmyths areconstructed.
The Islanders have developed some beautiful
nature-myths. Certain phenomena have been
observed and theimagination has fitted the
story totheinteresting object which has at-
tracted attention.
Now theRainbow Maiden ofManoa, avalley
lyingback ofHonolulu, isthestory ofaprincess
whose continual death and resurrection were
invented toharmonize with theformation ofa
series ofexquisite rainbows which arebornon
themountain-sides intheupper endofthevalley
and diewhen themist clouds reach theplain
intowhich thevalley opens. Then there were
thefishoftheHawaiian Islands which viewith
thebutterflies ofSouth America intheir multi-
tudinous combinations ofcolors. These im-


VI INTRODUCTION
aginative people wondered how the fishwere
painted, soforastory abattle between two
chiefs was either invented ortaken asabasis.
The chiefs fought onthemountain-sides until
finally onewasdriven into theseaandcom-
pelled tomake thedeep waters hiscontinual
abiding-place. Here hefound aunique and
pleasant occupation incalling thevarious kinds
offishtohissubmarine home andthen painting
them invaried hues according tothedictates
ofhisfancy. Thuswehave apurenature-myth
developed from thelove ofthebeautiful, one
ofthehighest emotions dwelling inthehearts
oftheHawaiians ofthelong ago.
So,again, Maui, awonder-working hero like
theHercules ofGrecian mythology, heard the
birds sing,andnoted their beautiful forms as
they flitted from treetotreeandmingled their
bright plumage with theleaves ofthefragrant
blossoms.
Noother oneofthosewho lived inthelong
agocould seewhatMaui saw.They heard the
mysterious music, butthesongsters were in-
visible. Many were the fancies concerning
these strange creatures whom they could hear
butcould notsee.Maui finally pitied hisfriends
andmade thebirds visible. Ever since,manhas
been able toboth hear themusic and seethe
beauty ofhisforest neighbors.


INTRODUCTION vii
Suchnature-myths asthese arewellworthy of
preservation bytheside ofanyEuropean fairy-
tale. Inpurity ofthought, vividness ofimagina-
tion, and delicacy ofcoloring theHawaiian
myths aretobegiven ahigh place inliterature
among thestories ofnature vivified bytheim-
agination.
Another side ofHawaiian folk-lore isjust as
worthy ofcomparison. Lovers of"Jack-the-
Giant-Killer," and oftheother wonder-workers
dwelling inthemist-lands ofother nations, would
enjoy reading themarvelous record ofMaui,
theskilful demi-god ofHawaii, whowent fish-
ingwithamagic hook, andpulled upfrom the
depths oftheocean groups ofislands. This
story istold inamatter-of-fact way, asifitwere
afishing-excursion onlyalittleoutoftheordinary
course. Maui lived inalandwhere volcanic
fireswere always burning inthemountains.
Nevertheless itwasalittle inconvenient towalk
thirty orforty miles foralivecoal after thecold
winds ofthenight hadputoutthe firewhich
hadbeen carefully protected theday before.
Thus, when hesawthatsome intelligent birds
knew theartofmaking afire,hecaptured the
leader andforced himtotellthesecret ofrubbing
certain sticks together until firecame.
Maui alsomade snares, captured thesunand
compelled ittojourney regularly and slowly


Vlil INTRODUCTION
across theheavens. Thus thedaywasregulated
tomeet thewants ofmankind. Helifted the
heavens after theyhadrested solongupon all
theplants that their leaves were flat.
There wasaledge ofrock inoneoftherivers,
soMaui uprooted atreeandpushed itthrough,
making aneasypassage forbothwater andman.
Heinvented many helpful articles fortheuseof
mankind, butmeanwhile frequently filled the
days ofhisfriends with trouble onaccount of
themischievous pranks which heplayed on
them.
Fairies andgnomes dwelt inthewoodland,
coming forth atnight tobuild temples, massive
walls, tofashion canoes, orwhisper warnings.
Thebirdsandthefishes were capable and intel-
ligent guardians over thehouseholds which had
adopted them asprotecting deities. Birds of
brilliant plumage andsweet song were always
faithful attendants onthe chiefs, and able to
converse with those overwhom theykeptwatch.
Sharks andother mighty fishofthedeepwaters
were reliable messengers forthosewhorendered
them sacrifices, often carrying their devotees
from island toisland andprotecting them from
many dangers.
Sometimes thegruesome and horrible creeps
intoHawaiian folk-lore. Apoison tree figures
inthelegends and finally becomes one ofthe


INTRODUCTION ix
most feared ofallthegods ofHawaii. Acan-
nibal dog,cannibal ghosts, andeven acannibal
chief areprominent among thenoted characters
ofthepast.
Then thepower ofpraying aperson todeath
with theaidofdeparted spirits wasbelieved in,
and isatthepresent time.
Almost every valley oftheisland has its
peculiar andinteresting myth. Often there isa
historical foundation which hasbeen dealt with
fancifully andenlarged intomiraculous propor-
tions. There arehidden caves, which canbe
entered onlybydiving under thegreat breakers
orintothedeep waters ofinland pools, around
which cluster tales ofloveandadventure.
There aremany mythological characters whose
journeys extend toalltheislands ofthegroup.
TheMaui stories arenotlimited tothelarge
island Hawaii andapart oftheadjoining island
which bears thename ofMaui, butthese stories
aretold inagarbled formonalltheislands. So
Pele, thefire-goddess, whodwelt inthehottest
regions ofthemost active volcanoes, belongs to
all,andalsoKamapuaa, who issometimes her
husband, butmore frequently herenemy. The
conflicts between thetwo areoften suggested
bydestructive lava flows checked bystorms or
ocean waves. Itcannot besuspected thatthe
ancient Hawaiian hadtheleast idea ofdeifying


X INTRODUCTION
fireandwater—andyetthecontinual conflict
between man andwoman islike theeternal
enmity between thetwoantagonistic elements of
nature.
When theborders ofmist-land arecrossed,
arichstore offolk-lore with ahistorical foun-
dation isdiscovered. Chiefs andgods mingle
together asinthedays oftheNibelungen Lied.
Voyages aremade tomany distant islands ofthe
Pacific Ocean, whose names arefrequently men-
tioned inthesongs and tales ofthewandering
heroes. AchieffromSamoa establishes aroyal
family onthelargest oftheHawaiian Islands,
andachieffrom theHawaiian group becomes a
ruler inTahiti.
Indeed therovers ofthePacific have tales of
seafaring which equal theaccounts ofthevoy-
ages oftheVikings.
Thelegends oftheHawaiian Islands arevalu-
able inthemselves, inthatthey reveal anunder-
standing ofthephenomena ofnature andunveil
their early history with itsmythological setting.
They arealsovaluable forcomparison with the
legends oftheother Pacific islands, andthey are
exceedingly interesting when contrasted with
thefolk-lore ofother nations.


THEGHOST OFWAHAULA TEMPLE
TTAWAIIAN temples were never works of
^-art.Broken lavawasalways near the
siteuponwhich atemple wastobebuilt. Rough
imhewn stones were easily piled intomassive
walls and laid interraces foraltarand floors.
Water-worn pebbles were carried from thenearest
beach andstrewn overtheuneven floor,making
acomparatively smooth place overwhich the
naked feetofthetemple dwellers passed without
theinjuries which would otherwise frequently
come from thesharp-edged lava. Rude grass
huts built onterraces were theabodes ofthe
priests and ofthehigh chiefs whosometimes
visited theplaces ofsacrifice. Elevated, flat-
topped piles ofstones were usually built atone
end ofthetemple forthechief idolsandthe
sacrifices placed before them. Simplicity of
detail marked every step oftemple erection.
Nohewn pillars orarched gateways ofeven
themost primitive designs canbefound inany
ofthetemples whether ofrecent date orbelong-
ingtoremote antiquity. There wasnoattempt


2LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
atornamentation even intheimages ofthegreat
godswhich they worshipped. Crude, uncouth,
andhideous were theimages before which they
offered sacrifice andprayer.
Inthemselves theheiaus, ortemples, ofthe
Hawaiian Islands have but little attraction.
To-day they seem more likemassive walled
cattle-pens than places which had ever been
used forsacred worship.
Onthesoutheast coast oftheisland ofHawaii
nearKalapana isoneofthelargest, oldest, and
bestpreserved heiaus, ortemples, intheHawaiian
Islands. Itisnoexception tothearchitectural
rule forHawaiian temples, and isworthy the
name oftemple only asitisintimately associated
withthereligious customs oftheHawaiians. Its
walls areseveral feetthickandinplaces tento
twelve feet high. Itisdivided intorooms or
pens, inoneofwhich stillUesthehuge sacrificial
stone upon which victims—sometimes human—
were slain before thebodies were placed as
offerings infront ofthehideous idols leaning
against thestone walls.
This heiaunow bears thename Wahaula, or
"red-mouth." Inancient times itwasknown as
Ahaula, or"theredassembly," possibly denoting
that attimes thepriests and their attendants
wore redmantles intheir processions orduring
some part oftheir sacred ceremonies.


THEGHOST OFWAHAULA TEMPLE3
Thistemple issaid tobetheoldest ofallthe
Hawaiian heiaus—except possibly theheiau at
K.ohala onthenorthern coast ofthesame island.
These twoheiaus dateback intradition tothe
time ofPaao, thepriest fromUpolu, Samoa, who
wassaidtohave builtthem. Hewasthetradi-
tional father ofthepriestly linewhich ranparallel
totheroyal genealogy oftheKamehamehas
during several centuries imtil thelasthigh priest,
Hewahewa, became afollower ofJesus Christ—
theSaviour oftheworld. Thiswasthe last
heiau destroyed when theancient tabus and
ceremonial riteswere overthrown bythechiefs
justbefore thecoming ofChristian missionaries.
Atthattime thegrass houses ofthepriests were
burned and. inthese raging flames werethrown
thewooden idolsback ofthealtars andthebam-
boohuts ofthesoothsayers andtherudeimages
onthewalls, with everything combustible which
belonged totheancient order ofworship. Only
thewallsandrough stone floors were leftinthe
temple.
Intheouter temple court wasthemost noted
sacred grave inalltheislands. Earth hadbeen
carried from themountain-sides inland. Leaves
anddecaying treesadded tothepermanency of
the soil. Here inamost unlikely place itwas
saidthat allthevarieties oftrees thenfound in
theislands hadbeen gathered bythepriests—


4 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
thedescendants ofPaao. Tothisdaythegrave
stands bythetemple walls, anobject ofsuper-
stitious aweamong thenatives. Many ofthe
varieties oftrees there planted have died, leaving
only those which weremore, hardy andneeded
lesspriestly carethan they received ahundred
years ormore ago.
Thetemple isbuUtnearthecoastontherough,
sharp, broken rocks ofanancient lava flow. In
many places inandaround thetemple thelava
wasdugout,making holes three orfour feetacross
andfrom one totwo feetdeep. These inthe
days ofthepriesthood hadbeen filled with earth
brought inbaskets from themountains. Here
they raised sweet potatoes andtaroandbananas.
Now therains havewashed the soilaway and
totheunknowing there isnosign ofprevious
agricultiure. Near these depressions andalong
thepaths leading toWahaula other holes were
sometimes cutoutofthehard fine-grained lava.
When heavy rains fell, little grooves carried the
drops ofwater tothese holesandtheybecame
small cisterns. Here the thirsty messengers
running from onepriestly clan toanother, or
thetraveller orworshippers coming tothesacred
place, could almost always findafewdrops of
water toquench their thirst.
Usually these water-holes were covered with
alarge flatstone under which thewater raninto


THEGHOST OFWAHAULA TEMPLE 5
the cistern. To thisday these small water-
places border thepath across thepahoehoe lava
fieldwhich Uesadjacent tothebroken a-alava
uponwhich theWahaula heiau isbuilt. Many
ofthem are stillcovered asinthedays ofthe
long ago.
Itisnotstrange thatlegends have developed
through themists ofthecentxiries around this
rude oldtemple.
Wahaula wasatabutemple ofthevery highest
rank. Thenative chants said,
"Nokdaheiau oiakekapu enaena."
("Concerning thisheiau istheburning tabu.")
"Enaena" means "burning with aredhot
rage." Theheiau wassothoroughly "tabu," or
"kapu," that thesmoke ofitsfires falling upon
anyofthepeople orevenuponanyoneofthe
chiefs was sufficient cause forptmishment by
death, with thebody asasacrifice tothegods
ofthetemple.
These gods were ofthevery highest rank
among theHawaiian deities. Certain dayswere
tabu toLono—orRongo, ashewasknown in
other island groups ofthePacific Ocean. Other
daysbelonged toKu—whowasalsoworshipped
fromNew Zealand toTahiti. Atother times
Kane, known asTane bymany Polynesians,
was held supreme. Then again Kanaloa—or
Tanaroa, sometimes worshipped inSamoa and


6LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
other island groups asthegreatest ofalltheir
gods—hadhisdays especially setapart forsacri-
ficeandchant.
TheMu, or"body-catcher," ofthisheiau
with hisassistants seems tohavebeen continually
onthewatch forhuman victims, andwoe to
theunfortunate manwho carelessly origno-
rantly walked where thewinds blew thesmoke
from thetemple fires.Noonedared rescue him
from thehands ofthehunter ofmen—forthen
thewrath ofallthegodswassure tofollow him
allthedays ofhis life.
Thepeople ofthedistricts around Wahaula
always watched thecourse ofthewinds with
great anxiety, carefully noting the direction
taken bythesmoke. This smoke was the
shadow castbythedeity worshipped, andwas
farmore sacred than theshadow ofthehighest
chief orking inalltheislands.
Itwasalways sufficient cause fordeath ifa
common man allowed hisshadow tofallupon
anytabu chief, i.e.,achief ofespecially high
rank; butinthis"burning tabu," ifanyman
permitted thesmoke orshadow ofthegod
whowasbeing worshipped inthistemple to
come near tohimorovershadow him, itwasa
mark ofsuch great disrespect that thegodwas
supposed tobeenaena, orredhotwith rage.
Many agesagoayoung chiefwhom weshall

know bythename Kahele determined totake
anespecial journey around theisland visiting
allthenoted andsacred places andbecoming
acquainted with the alii,orchiefs, oftheother
districts.
Hepassed from place toplace, taking part
with thechiefswho entertained himsometimes
intheuseofthepapa-hee, orsurf-board, riding
thewhite-capped surf asitmajestically swept
shoreward—sometimes spending night after night
intheinnumerable gambling contests which
passed under thename piliwaiwai—andsome-
times riding thenarrow sled, orholua, withwhich
Hawaiian chiefs raced down thesteep grassed
lanes. Then again, with adeep sense ofthe
solemnity ofsacred things, hevisited themost
noted oftheheiaus andmade contributions to
theofferings before thegods. Thus thedays
passed, andtheslowjourney wasvery pleasant
toKahele.
Intimehecame toPuna, thedistrict inwhich
waslocated thetemple Wahaula.
But alas! inthemidst ofthemany stories of
thepastwhich hehadheard, andthemany
pleasures hehadenjoyed while onhisjourney,
Kahele forgot thepeculiar power ofthetabu of
thesmoke ofWahaula. The fierce winds of
thesouth were blowing and changing from
point topoint. Theyoungmansawthesacred

grove intheedge ofwhich thetemple walls
could bediscerned. Thinwreaths ofsmoke were
tossed hereandtherefrom thetemple fires.
Kahele hastened toward thetemple. TheMu
waswatching hiscoming andjoyfully marking
him asavictim. The altars ofthegods were
desolate, and ifbutaparticle ofsmoke fellupon
theyoung man noonecould keephimfrom
thehands oftheexecutioner.
The perilous moment came. Thewarm
breath ofone ofthe firestouched theyoung
chief's cheek. Soon ablow from theclub of
theMulaidhim senseless ontherough stones
oftheouter court ofthetemple. Thesmoke of
thewrath ofthegodshad fallen upon him,and
itwaswellthatheshould lieasasacrifice upon
their altars.
Soon thebody with the life still initwas
thrown across the sacrificial stone. Sharp
knives made from thestrong wood ofthebamboo
lethislife-blood flowdown thedepressions across
theface ofthestone. Quickly thebody was
dismembered andoffered asasacrifice.
Forsome reason thepriests, after the flesh
had decayed, setapart thebones forsome
special purpose. The legends imply that the
bones were tobetreated dishonorably. Itmay
have been that thebones were folded together
intheshapeknown asunihipili, or"grasshopper"


THEGHOST OFWAHAULA TEMPLE g
bones, i.e.,folded and laidaway forpurposes
ofincantation. Such bundles ofbones were
putthrough aprocess ofprayers andcharms
until atlast itwasthought anew spirit was
created which dwelt inthatbundle andgave
thepossessor apeculiar power indeeds ofwitch-
craft.
The spirit ofKahele rebelled against this dis-
position ofallthatremained ofhisbody. He
wanted tobeback inhisnative district, that
hemight enjoy thepleasures oftheUnder-world
with hisown chosen companions. Restlessly
thespirithaunted thedark corners ofthetemple,
watching thepriests astheyhandled hisbones.
Helplessly theghostfumed andfretted against
itscondition. Itdidallthatadisembodied spirit
could dotoattract theattention ofthepriests.
Atlastthespirit fledbynight from thisplace
oftorment tothehome which hehadsojoyfully
leftashort time before.
Kahele's father was thehigh chief ofKau.
Surrounded byretainers, hepassed hisdays in
quietness andpeace waiting forthereturn of
hisson.
Onenight astrange dream came tohim.He
heard avoice calling from themysterious con-
fines ofthespirit-land. Ashelistened, aspirit
form stoodbyhisside. Theghost wasthat of
hissonKahele.


lO LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Bymeans ofthedream theghost revealed to
thefather thathehadbeenputtodeath and
that hisbones were ingreat danger ofdishonorable
treatment.
Thefather awoke benumbed with fear, realizing
that hissonwascalling uponhim forimmediate
help. Atoncehelefthispeople andjourneyed
from place toplace secretly, notknowing where
orwhen Kahele haddied,butfuUy surethatthe
spirit ofhisvision wasthat ofhisson. Itwas
not difficult totrace theyoung man. Hehad
left hisfootprints openly allalong theway.
There wasnothing ofshame ordishonor—and
thefather's heart filled with pride ashehastened
on.
From time totime, however, heheard the
spirit voice calling him tosave thebones ofthe
body ofhisdead son.Atlasthefeltthat his
journey wasnearly done. Hehadfollowed the
footsteps ofKahele almost entirely around the
island, andhadcome toPuna—thelast district
before hisownland ofKauwould welcome his
return.
The spirit voice could beheard now inthe
dream which nightly came tohim. Warnings
anddirections were frequently given.
Then the chiefcame tothelava fields of
Wahaula and laydown torest. The ghost
came tohimagain inadream, telling himthat

great personal danger wasnear athand. The
chief was avery strong man, excelhng in
athletic andbrave deeds, butinobedience tothe
spirit voice heroseearly inthemorning, secured
oilynutsfromakukui-tree, beatoutthe oil,and
anointed himself thoroughly.
Walking along carelessly asiftoavoid sus-
picion, hedrew near tothelands ofthetemple
Wahaula. Soon amancame outtomeet him.
ThismanwasanOlohe, abeardless man belong-
ingtoalawless robber clanwhich infested the
district, possibly assisting theman-hunters of
thetemple insecuring victims forthetemple
altars. This Olohe wasvery strong and self-
confident, andthought hewould have butUttle
difficulty indestroying thisstranger who jour-
neyed alone through Puna.
Almost alldaythebattle raged between the
twomen. Back and forth they forced each
other over thelava beds. The chief's well-oiled
bodywasvery difficult fortheOlohe tograsp.
Bruised andbleeding from repeated fallsonthe
rough lava,both ofthecombatants werebecoming
very weary. Then thechiefmade anewattack,
forcing theOlohe intoanarrow place fromwhich
there wasnoescape, and atlast seizing him,
breaking hisbones, andthenkilhng him.
Astheshadows ofnight rested overthetemple
and itssacred grave thechief crept closer to


12LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
thedreaded tabu walls. Concealing himself
hewaited fortheghost toreveal tohimthebest
plan foraction. Theghost came, butwascom-
pelled tobidthefather wait patiently forafit
timewhen thesecret place inwhich thebones
werehidden could besafely visited.
Forseveral daysandnights thechief hidhim-
selfnear thetemple. Hesecretly uttered the
prayers andincantations needed tosecure the
protection ofhisfamily gods.
Onenight thedarkness wasvery great, and
thepriests andwatchmen ofthetemple feltsure
thatnoonewould attempt toenter thesacred
precincts. Deep sleep rested upon allthetemple-
dwellers.
Then theghost ofKahele hastened totheplace
where thefather wassleeping andaroused him
forthedangerous taskbefore him.

Theghost urged thechief totake these bones
anddepart quickly.
The father obeyed, andfollowed the spirit
guide until safely away from thetemple ofthe
burning wrath ofthegods. Hecarried thebones
toKauandplaced them inhisown secret family
burial cave.
Theghost ofWahaula wentdown tothespirit

oftheyoung chiefhadbeen taken fortemple

MALUAE ANDTHEUNDER-WORLD
THISisastory fromManoa Valley, back of
Honolulu. Intheupper endofthevalley,
atthefoot ofthehighest mountains onthe
island Oahu, lived Maluae. Hewasafarmer,
andhadchosen thislandbecause rain fellabun-
dantly onthemoimtains,and thestreams brought
down fine soilfrom thedecaying forests and
disintegrating rocks, fertilizing hisplants.
Herehecultivated bananas andtaroandsweet
potatoes. Hisbananas grew rapidly bythesides
ofthebrooks, andyielded large bunches offruit
from their tree-like stems; histaro filled small
walled-in pools, growing inthewater likewater-
lilies, until theroots were matured, when the
plants were pulled upandtheroots boiled and
prepared forfood; hissweet potatoes—avege-
tableknown among theancient NewZealanders
asku-maru, andsupposed tohavecome from
Hawaii—wereplanted onthedrier uplands.
Thus hehadplenty offood continually grow-
ing,andripening fromtime totime. Whenever
hegathered anyofhisfoodproducts hebrought

altar before thegodsKane andKanaloa, thenhe
took theresttohishome forhisfamily toeat.
Hehadaboywhom hedearly loved, whose
name wasKaa-lii (rolling chief). Thisboywas
acareless, rollicking child.
Onedaytheboywastiredandhungry. He
passed bythetemple ofthegodsandsawbananas,
ripeandsweet, ontheUttle platform before the
gods. Hetook these bananas andatethem all.
Thegods looked down onthealtar expecting
tofindfood, but itwas allgoneandtherewas
nothing forthem. They were very angry, and
ranoutafter theboy. They caught himeating
thebananas, and killed him. Thebody they
leftlying under the trees, andtaking outhis
ghost threw itintotheUnder-world.
The father toiled hour after hour cultivating
hisfood plants, andwhen wearied returned to
hishome. Onthewayhemetthetwogods.
They told hinahow hisboyhadrobbed them
oftheir sacrifices andhowtheyhadpunished
him. They said, "Wehave sent hisghostbody
tothelowest regions oftheUnder-world."
The father wasvery sorrowful andheavy-
hearted ashewentonhisway tohisdesolate
home. Hesearched forthebody ofhisboy,and
atlastfound it.Hesawtoothatthestory of
thegods was true, forpartly eaten bananas
filled themouth, which wassetindeath.

Hewrapped thebody very carefully inkapa
cloth made from thebark of trees. He
carried itinto hisrest-house and laid itonthe
sleeping-mat. After atimehelaydown beside
thebody, refusing allfood,andplanning todie
with hisboy.Hethought ifhecould escape
from hisownbody hewould beable togodown
where theghost ofhisboyhadbeen sent. If

They looked down onthealtar ofsacrifice, but
therewasnothing forthem.
Thenight passed andthefollowing day.The
father laybytheside ofhisson,neither eating

house wastightly closed.
Then thegods talked together, andKane said:
"Maluae eatsnofood, heprepares noawa to

back theghost oftheboy. Sotheywent to

The father wasveryweak from hunger, and
longing fordeath, andcould scarcely listen to

When Kane said,"Have youlove foryour

iswithout end." "Can yougodown intothe

"No," thefather said, "no, Icanonly die

Then thegods said,"We willgiveyouthe

Then the father, stirred byhope, roseup

Not farfromHonolulu isabeautiful modern
estate with fine roads, lakes, running brooks,
and interesting valleys extending back into
themountain range. This iscalledbythevery
ancient name Moanalua (two lakes). Near

noted ghost localities oftheislands. Theghosts
after wandering over theisland Oahu would
come tothisplace tofindaway into their real
home, theUnder-world, or,astheHawaiians
usually called it,Po.
Here was aghostly breadfruit-tree named
Lei-walo, possibly meaning "the eight wreaths"
or"theeighth wreath"—thelastwreath ofleaves
from theland oftheliving which would meet
theeyes ofthedying.
Theghosts would leaporflyorclimb intothe
branches ofthis tree, trying tofindarotten
branch uponwhich theycould situntil itbroke
andthrew them intothedark seabelow.
Maluae climbed upthebreadfruit-tree. He
found abranch upon which some ghosts were
sitting waiting forittofall. Hisweight wasso
much greater than theirs that thebranch broke
atonce, anddown they allfellintotheland of
Po.

able topush past thefabled guardians ofthe
pathway oftheghosts intheUpper-world. As
heentered theUnder-world heagain tasted the
food ofthegodsandhefelthimself growing
stronger andstronger.
Hetook amagic war-club andaspear outof
thecane given bythegods. Ghostly warriors
tried tohinder hisentrance into thedifferent
districts ofthedark land. The spirits ofdead
chiefs challenged himwhen hepassed their
homes. Battle after battle was fought. His
magic club struck thewarriors down, and his
spear tossed them aside.
Sometimes hewaswarmly greeted andaided
byghosts ofkindly spirit. Thus hewent from
place toplace, searching forhisboy, finding him
atlast, astheHawaiians quaintly expressed it,
"down inthepapa-ku" (theestablished founda-
tion ofPo), choking and suffocating from the
bananas ofghost-land which hewascompelled
tocontinually force into hismouth.
The father caught the spirit oftheboyand
started back toward theUpper-world, butthe
ghosts surrounded him. They tried tocatch
himandtake thespiritaway from him. Again
thefather partook ofthefood ofthegods. Once

enemies were toogreat. Multitudes arose on

Backward fledthemultitudes ofspirits. The
father thrust thespirit oftheboyquickly into
theempty magic caneandrushed swiftly upto

which means "The Cape ofKaena."
Out intheocean ashort distance from this

Pohaku-o-Kauai, orrock ofKauai, alarge island
northwest ofOahu. This rock isaslarge asa

There isaninteresting legend toldontheisland
ofOahu which explains why these names have
forgenerations been fastened tothecapeandto
therock.Along, long time agothere lived
ontheisland Kauai aman ofwonderful power,
bythename ofHau-pu. When hewasborn, the
signs ofademi-god were overandaround the
house ofhisbirth. Lightning flashed through
the skies, and thunder reverberated, rolling
along themountain-sides.
Thunder andlightning were very rare inthe
Hawaiian Islands, andweresupposed tobecon-
nected with thebirth ordeath orsome veryun-
usual occurrence inthelifeofachief.
Mighty floods ofrain fellandpoured intor-

therapids andthewaterfalls became thecolor

During thestorm, andeven after sunshine
filled thevalley, abeautiful rainbow rested over
thehouse inwhich theyoung chiefwasborn.
This rainbow wasthought tocome from the
miraculous powers ofthenew-born child shining
outfromhiminstead offrom thesunlight around
him.Many chiefs throughout thecenturies of
Hawaiian legends were said tohave had this
rainbow around them alltheir lives.
Hau-pu while achildwasvery powerful, and
after hegrewupwaswidely known asagreat
warrior. Hewould attack anddefeat armies of
hisenemies without aidfromanyperson. His
spear was like amighty weapon, sometimes
piercing ahost ofenemies, andsometimes putting
aside allopposition when hethrust itinto the
ranks ofhisopponents.
Ifhehadthrown hisspearand iffighting with

these islands were hidden from each other; but
when they lifted^ therugged valleys ofthe

This night thestrongman stirred inhissleep.
Indistinct noises seemed tosurround hishouse.

Soon hewasaroused asecond time, andhe

Gradually thecanoes came nearer andnearer

The chiefKaena and hiscanoe were inthe

generation togeneration.
The oldHawaiians were frequently myth-
makers. They imagined many afairy-story for
thedifferent localities oftheislands, andthese
arevery interesting. Themyth ofthetwotaro
plants belongs toSouth Kona, Hawaii, and
affords anexcellent illustration ofHawaiian
imagination. Thestory istoldindifferent ways,
andcame tothewriter inthepresent form:
Achief lived onthemountain-side above
Hookena. There hispeople cultivated taro,
made kapa cloth, andprepared thetrunks of
koa-trees forcanoes. Hehadavery finetaro
patch. Theplants prided themselves upon their
rapidandperfect growth.
Inonepart ofthetaropond, sidebyside,

filled thehearts ofthetwotaroplants and re-
sulted inpledges ofundying affection.
Onedaythechiefwastalking tohisservants
about thefood tobemade ready forafeast. He
ordered thetwoespecially finetaroplants tobe
pulled up.One oftheservants came tothe
home ofthetwolovers andtoldthem thatthey
were tobetakenbythechief.
Because oftheir great affection foreach other
theydetermined tocling tolifeaslongaspossible,
andtherefore moved toanother part ofthetaro
patch, leaving their neighbors tobepulled up
instead ofthemselves.
Butthechiefsoonsawthem intheirnewhome
andagain ordered their destruction. Again they
fled. Thishappened from time totime until
theangry chief determined thatthey should be
taken, nomatter what part ofthepond they
might bein.
Thetwo taro plants thought best toflee,
therefore took tothemselves wings andmade a
short flight toaneighboring taro patch. Here
again theirenemy found them.Asecond flight
wasmade toanother part ofSouth Kona, and
then tostillanother, until allKona was inter-
ested intheperpetual pursuit andtheperpetual
escape. Atlastthere wasnopart ofKona in
which they could beconcealed. Afriend ofthe

one oftheirown friends would givewarning of
thecoming oftheir pursuer. Atlasttheyleaped

than hisfeet, sotheyhadalittle restbefore he

under akindly chief. Here they settled down
andlivedmany years under thename ofKalo-

LEGENDARY CANOE-MAKING 29
LEGENDARY CANOE-MAKING
SOMEoftheHawaiian treeshave beautifully
grained wood, andatthepresent time are
very valuable forfurniture and interior decora-
tion. Thekoa isprobably thebest ofthetrees
ofthis class. Itisknown astheHawaiian
mahogany. The grain isvery fineandcurly
andwavy, and iscapable ofavery high polish.
Thekoa stillgrows luxuriantly onthesteep sides
andalong theridges ofthehighmountains of

treetrunks bytheaidofthekohi-pohaku, the
cutting stone, oradze, ofancient Hawaii. Some-
times these canoes weregiven miraculous powers
ofmotion sothattheyswept through theseas

oversomeoneofthehigh chiefs, would carryhim
from island toisland inacanoe which never
rested when calms prevailed orstopped when
fierce waves wrenched, butbore thechief swiftly
andunfailingly tothedesired haven.
There isadelightful little story about achief
who visited themost northerly island, Kauai.
Hefound thenatives ofthat island feasting and
revelling inalltheabandon ofsavage life. Sports
andgames innumerable were enjoyed. Thus
dayandnight passed until, asthemorning ofa
newdaydawned, anunwonted stiralong the
beach made manifest some event ofvery great
importance. Thenew chief apparently cared
but little foralltheexcitement. Theking of
theisland hadsentoneofhisroyal ornaments
toasmall island some miles distant from the
Kauai shores. Hewasblessed with adaughter
sobeautiful that alltheavailable chiefs desired
herforwife. The father, hoping toavoid the
complications which threatened toinvolve his
household with thehouseholds ofthejealous
suitors, announced that hewould give his
daughter tothemanwhosecured theornament
from thefar-away island. Itwas tobeacanoe
racewith awife fortheprize.
Theyoung chiefs waited forthehourappointed.
Their well-polished koacanoes lined thebeach.
Thestranger chiefmade nopreparation. Quietly


LEGENDARY CANOE-MAKING 31
heenjoyed thegibesandtaunts hurled fromone
toanother bytheyoung chiefs. Laughingly
herequested permission tojoin inthecontest,
receiving asthereward forhisrequest alook'
ofapprobation from thehandsome chiefess.
Thewordwasgiven. Thewell-manned canoes
werepushed from theshoreandforced outthrough
theinrolling surf. Intherushsome oftheboats
were interlocked with others, some filled with
water, while others safely broke away from the
restandpassed outofsight toward thecoveted
island. Still thestranger seemed tobeinno
haste towintheprize. Thefaceofthechiefess
grewdark withdisappointment.
Atlastthestranger launched hisfinely polished
canoe andcalled oneofhisfollowers tosailwith
him. Itseemed tobeutterly impossible forhim
toevendream ofsecuring theprize, butthe
canoe began tomove asifithadthewings ofa

taken forhiscompanion inhismagic canoe one
ofthegods controlling theocean winds. Hewas
first toreach theisland. Then hecame swiftly
back forhisbride. Hemade hishomeamong
hisnew friends.
TheHawaiians hadmany interesting cere-
monies inconnection with theprocess ofsecur-
ingthetreeandfashioning itintoacanoe.
David Malo, aHawaiian writer ofabout the


32 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
year 1840, says,"The building ofacanoe wasa
religious matter." When amanfound afinekoa-
treehewent tothepriest whose province was
canoe-making and said,"Ihavefound akoa-tree,
afinelarge tree." Onreceiving thisinformation
thepriest went atnight tosleep before hisshrine.
Ifinhissleep hehad avision ofsome one
standing naked before him,heknew that the
koa-tree wasrotten, andwould notgoupinto
thewoods tocutthat tree. Ifanother treewas
found andhedreamed ofahandsome well-dressed
man orwoman standing before him,when he
awoke hefeltsurethat thetreewould make a
good canoe. Preparations weremade accordingly
togointothemountains andhewthekoainto
acanoe. They took withthem asofferings a
pig,cocoanuts, redfish,andawa. Having come,
totheplace they rested forthenight, sacrificing
these things tothegods.
Sometimes, when aroyal canoe was tobe
prepared, itseems asifhuman beings were also
brought andslain attherootofthetree. There is
norecord ofcannibalism connected with these
sacrifices, andyetwhen thepigand fishhad
been offered before the tree, usually aholewas
dug close tothetreeandanoven prepared in
which themeatandvegetables werecooked for
themorning feast ofthecanoe-makers. The tree
was carefully examined andthesigns andpor-


LEGENDARY CANOE-MAKING33
tents noted. Thesong ofalittle birdwould
frequently cause anentire change intheenter-
prise.
When thetimecame tocutdown thetree
thepriest would take hisstone axeand offer
prayer tothemaleandfemale deities whowere
supposed tobethespecial patrons ofcanoe-
building, showing them the axe,and saying:
"Listen now totheaxe. This istheaxewhich
istocutdown thetreeforthecanoe."
David Malo says:"When thetreebegan to
crack, ready tofall,they lowered their voices
andallowed noone tomake adisturbance.
When thetreehad fallen, thehead priestmounted
thetrunk and called out,'Smite with theaxe,
andhollow thecanoe.' Thiswasrepeated again
andagain ashewalked along thefallen tree,
marking thefulllength ofthedesired canoe."
Dr.Emerson gives thefollowing asoneofthe
prayers sometimes usedbythepriestwhen pass-
ingalong thetrunk ofthetree:
"Grant acanoe which shallbeswift asafish
Tosailinstormy seas
When thestorm tosses onallsides."
After thecanoe hadbeen roughly shaped, the
ends pointed, thebottom rounded, andperhaps
aportion oftheinside ofthelogremoved, the
people fastened hues tothecanoe tohaul itdown
tothebeach. When theywere ready forthe


34LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
work thepriest again prayed: "Oh, canoe gods,
lookyouafter thiscanoe. Guard itfromstem to
stern, until itisplaced inthecanoe-house."
Then thecanoe washauled bythepeople
infront, orheldbackbythosewhowere inthe
rear, imtil ithadpassed aUthehardandsteep
places along themountain-side andbeenputin
place forthefinishing touches. When completed,
pigand fishand fruits were again offered tothe
gods. Sometimes huiiian beings were again a
part ofthesacrifice.
Prayers and incantations were part ofthe
ceremony. There was tobenodisturbance or
noise, orelse itwould bedangerous foritsowner
togooutinhisnew canoe. Ifallthepeople
except thepriest hadbeen quiet, thecanoe was
pronounced safe.
Itissaid that theceremony oflashing the
outrigger tothecanoe wasofverygreat solemnity,
probably because theabiUty topassthrough the
high surfwaves depended somuch upon theout-
rigger asabalance which kept thecanoe from
being overturned.
The story ofLaka andthe fairies istold to
illustrate the difficulties surrounding canoe-
making. Laka desired tomake afinecanoe, and
sought through the forests forthebest tree
available. Taking hisstone axehetoiled allday
until thetreewasfeUed. Then hewenthome

Then shesummoned herbrother, Makani-kau,

also tried tocatch Makani-kau, buthewastoo

some people inaboatchased byabigshark. He
leaped ontheboatandtoldthem hewould play
with theshark andthey could staynearbut
need not fear. Then hejumped intothe sea.
Theshark turned overandopened itsmouth
toseizehim; heclimbed on it,caught itsfins,
andforced ittofleethrough thewater. He
drove ittotheshore andmade itfastamong
the rocks. Itbecame agreat shark stone,

from theshark toland, theboat following.

Faruponthe hillwasavastnumber ofiiwi

ThiswastheoneLau-ka-ieie desired forher
husband. They carried thisboyontheirwings
easily andgently over the hillsandseatoward
thesunset island, Lehua. There they slowly
flew toearth. They were thebirdguardians of
Kawelona, andwhen they travelled from place
toplace theywere under thedirection ofthe
bird-sorcerer, Kukala-a-ka-manu.
Kawelona haddreamed ofabeautiful girl
whohadvisited himagain andagain, sohewas
prepared tomeet Makani-kau. Hetold his
parents andadopted guardians and bird-priests
about hisdreams andthebeautiful girlhewanted
tomarry.
Makani-kau met thewinds ofNiihau and
Lehua, andatlastwaswelcomed bythebirds.
HetoldKawelona hismission, whoprepared to
gotoHawaii, asking howtheyshould go.Maka-
ni-kau went totheseaside and called forhis
many bodies tocomeandgivehimtheboat for

thehusband oftheir great sister Lau-ka-ieie.
Thus hemadeknown hismana, orspirit power,
toKawelona. Hecalled onthegreat cloud-gods
tosend thelongwhite cloud-boat, and itsoon
appeared. Kawelona entered theboatwith fear,
andinafewminutes lostsight oftheisland of
Lehua and hisbirdguardians ashesailed out
into the sea. Makani-kau dropped down by
thesideofabeautiful shell-boat, entered it,and
stopped atMana. There hetook several girls
andputthem inadouble canoe, orau-waa-olalua
(spirit-boat).
Meanwhile the sorcerer ruler ofthebirds
agreed tofind outwhere Kawelona was to
satisfy thelonging ofhisparents, whom hehad
leftwithout showing them where hewasgoing
orwhat dangers hemight meet. The sorcerer
poured water intoacalabash andthrew intwo
lehua flowers, which floated onthewater. Then
heturned hiseyestoward thesunandprayed:
"Oh, great sun, towhom belongs theheavens,
turnyour eyesdownward tolookonthewater

therein !Lookupon thebeautiful young woman.
She isnotonefrom Kauai. There isnoone
more beautiful than she.Herhome isunder

The sorcerer sawthesun-pictures inthewater,


44 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
andinterpreted tothefriends thejourney ofKa-
welona, telling them itwasalong, longway,and
theymust wait patiently many days forany
word. Inthesigns hesaw theboy inthe
cloud-boat, Makani-kau inhisshell-boat, and
thethree girls inthespirit-boat.
The girls were carried toOahu, and there
found the shell-girl, Pupu-kani-oi, leftbyMa-
kani-kau onhisway toLehua. They took her
with herhusband and hissisters inthe spirit-
boat. There were nine inthecompany of
travellers toHawaii: Kawelona inhiscloud-
boat; two girlsfromKauai; Kaiahe, agirlfrom
Oahu; three fromMolokai, onefromMaui; and
agirl called Lihau. Makani-kau himself was
theleader; hehadtaken the girls away. On
thisjourney hetiu-ned their boats toKahoo-
lawe tovisitKa-moho-alii, theruler ofthesharks.
There Makani-kau appeared inhisfinesthuman
body, andthey alllanded. Makani-kau took
Kawelona from hiscloud-boat, went inland,
andplaced him inthemidst ofthecompany,
teUing them hewasthehusband forLau-ka-ieie.
They were allmade welcome bytheruler ofthe
sharks.
Ka-moho-alii called hissharks tobring food
from alltheislands overwhich theywere placed
asguardians; sothey quickly brought prepared
food, fish, flowers, leis,and gifts ofallkinds.


LAV-KA-IEIE45
Thecompany feasted and rested. Then Ka-
moho-alii called hissharks toguard thetravellers
ontheir journey. Makani-kau went inhisshell-
boat, Kawelona inhiscloud-boat, and they
were allcarried over theseauntil they landed
under themountains ofHawaii.
Makani-kau, inhiswindbody, carried theboats
swiftly ontheir journey toWaipio. Lau-ka-ieie
heard herbrother's voice calling herfrom the
sea. Hina answered. Makani-kau andKa-
welona wentuptoWaimea tocross over toLau-
ka-ieie's house, butwere taken byHina tothe
topofMauna Kea. Poliahu and Lilinoe saw
thetwo fineyoung menandcalled tothem, but
Makani-kau passed by,without aword, tohis
ownwonderful home inthecaves ofthemoun-
tains resting intheheart ofmists and fogs,and
placed allhistravellers there. Makani-kau went
down totheseaand called thesharks ofKa-
moho-alii. They appeared intheirhuman bodies
inthevalley ofWaipio, leaving theirshark bodies
resting quietly inthe sea.They feasted and
danced neartheancient temple ofKahuku-welo-
welo, which was theplace where thewonderful
shell, Kiha-pu, waskept.
Makani-kau putseven shells onthetopofthe
precipice andtheyblew untilsweet sounds floated
over alltheland. Thus wasthemarriage of
Lau-ka-ieie andKawelona celebrated.


46LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Alltheshark people rested, soothed bythe
music. After thewedding they bade farewell
andreturned toKahoolawe, going around the
southern side oftheisland, for itwascounted,
badluck toturn back. They must gostraight
ahead allthewayhome. Makani-kau went to
hissister's house, andmetthegirlsandLau-ka-
ieie.Hetoldherthat hishouse was full of
strangers, asthepeople ofthedifferent kupua
bodies hadassembled tocelebrate thewedding.
These were thekupua people oftheHawaiian
Islands. Theeepapeople weremore like fairies
andgnomes, andwere usually somewhat de-
formed. Thekupuas maybeclassified asfollows:
Ka-poe-kino-lau (thepeople whohad leafbodies).
"""-pua (thepeople whohadflower bodies).

After themarriage, Pupu-kani-oi (the singing

andstarted back toMolokai. Ontheirwaythey

heard sweet bird voices. Makani-kau had a
feather house covered with rainbow colors.
Later hewent toKauai, andbrought back the
adopted parents ofKawelona todwell onHawaii,
where Lau-ka-ieie livedhappily withherhusband.
Hiilawe became very ill,andcalled hisbrother
Makani-kau and hissister Lau-ka-ieie tocome
nearand Usten. Hetoldthem that hewas
going todie,andtheymust buryhimwhere he
could always seetheeyes ofthepeople, andthen
hewould change hisbody intoawonderful new
body.
Thebeautiful girltook hismaloand leisand
placed them along thesides ofthevalley, where
theybecame beautiful treesandvines, andHina
made him live again; soHiilawe became an
aumakua ofthewaterfalls. Makani-kau took
thebody inhishands andcarried itinthethunder
andUghtning, burying itonthebrow ofthehigh-
estprecipice ofthevalley. Then hisbodywas
changed intoastone, which hasbeen lying there
forcenturies; buthisghost wasmade byHina
intoakupua, sothathecould always appear as
thewonderful misty falls ofWaipio, looking into
theeyes ofhispeople.
Aftermany years hadpassed Hina assumed
permanently theshape ofthebeautiful ohia-tree,
making herhome intheforest around thevol-
canoes ofHawaii. She stillhadmagic power,


48LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
andwasworshipped under thename Hina-ula-
ohia. Makani-kau watched over Lau-ka-ieie,
andwhen thetimecame forhertolayaside
herhuman body shecame tohimasaslender,
graceful woman, covered with leaves, hereyes
blazing like fire. Makani-kau said:"You are
avine;youcannot stand alone. Iwillcarryyou

You arethe ieie vine. Climb trees! Twine
your longleaves around them! Letyour blazing

Carried hither and thither byMakani-kau

tall trees, the ieievine hasforcenturies been
oneofthemost graceful treeornaments inall

Makani-kau inhisspirit formblew thegolden

sothat theRainbow Maiden, Anuenue, might

KAUHUHU, THESHARK-GOD OF
MOLOKAI
'TpHE story oftheshark-god Kauhuhu has
-•-been toldunder thelegend of"Aikanaka
(Man-eater)," which wastheancient name ofthe
little harbor Pukoo, which liesattheentrance
tooneofthebeautiful valleys oftheisland of
Molokai. Thebetter way istotake thelegend
asrevealing thegreat man-eater inoneofhis
most kindly aspects. Theshark-god appears as
thefriend ofapriestwho isseeking revenge for
thedestruction ofhischildren. Kamalo wasthe
name ofthepriest. Hisheiau, ortemple, wasat
Kaluaaha, avillage which faced thechannel
between theislands ofMolokai andMaui. Across
thechannel therugged red-brown slopes ofthe
mountain Eeke were lostinthemasses ofclouds
which continually hung aroimd itssharp peaks.
Thetwoboys ofthepriest delighted intheglori-
ousrevelations ofsunrise andsunset tossed in
shattered fragments ofcloud color, andrevelled
inthereflected tintswhich danced tothem over
theswift channel-currents. Itisnowonder that
thecourage ofskyandseaentered intothehearts


50LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
oftheboys,andthatmany deeds ofdaring were
donebythem. They were taught many ofthe
secrets ofthetemple bytheir father, butwere
warned that certain things were sacred tothe
godsandmust notbetouched. Thehigh chief,
oralii,ofthatpart oftheisland hadatemple a
short distance from Kaluaaha, inthevalley of
theharbor which was called Aikanaka. The
name ofthischiefwasKupa. The chiefs always
hadahouse buUt within thetemple walls as
theirown residence, towhich they could retire
atcertain seasons oftheyear. Kupa hadtwo
remarkable drums which hekept inhishouse at
theheiau. His skill inbeating hisdrums wasso
great thatthey could reveal histhoughts tothe
waiting priests.
OnedayKupa sailed faraway over thesea
tohisfavorite fishing-grounds. Meanwhile the
boysweretempted togotoKupa's heiau andtry
thewonderful drums. The valley ofthe little
harbor Aikanaka bore themusical nameMapu-
lehu. Along thebeach andover theridge has-
tened thetwosons ofKamalo. Quickly they
entered theheiau, found thehigh chief's house,
tookouthisdrums andbegan tobeatupon them.
Some ofthepeople heard thefamiliar tones of
thedriuns. They dared notenter thesacred
doors oftheheiau, butwatched until theboys
became weary oftheir sportandreturned home.

KAUHVHU, THESHARK-GOD OFMOLOKAI 51
WhenKupa returned they toldhimhowtheboys
hadbeaten upon hissacred drums. Kupa was
very angry, andordered hismu,ortemple sacri-
ficeseekers, tokilltheboysandbring their bodies
totheheiau tobeplaced onthealtar. When the
priest Kamalo heard ofthedeath ofhissons,
inbitterness ofheart hesought revenge. His
ownpower wasnotgreat enough tocope with
hishigh chief; therefore hesought theaidof
theseersandprophets ofhighest repute through-
outMolokai. Butthey feared Kupa thechief,
andcould notaidhim,andtherefore senthimon
toanother kaula, orprophet, orsenthimback to
consult some onetheother sideofhishome. All
thistimehecarried withhim fitting presents and
sacrifices, bywhich hehoped togain theassist-
ance ofthegods through their priests. Atlast
hecame tothesteep precipice which overlooks
Kalaupapa andKalawao, thepresent home ofthe
lepers. Atthefootofthisprecipice wasaheiau,
inwhich thegreat shark-god wasworshipped.
Down thesides oftheprecipice heclimbed and
atlastfound thepriest oftheshark-god. The
priest refused togiveassistance, butdirected him
togotoagreat cave inthebold cliffs south of
Kalawao. Thename ofthecavewasAnao-
puhi, thecave ofthe eel.Here dwelt thegreat
shark-god Kauhuhu andhisguardians orwatch-
ers,Waka andMo-o, thegreat dragons orreptiles


52LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
ofPoljTiesian legends. These dragons were
mighty warriors inthedefence oftheshark-god,
andwere hiskahus, orcaretakers, while heslept,
orwhen hiscave needed watching during his
absence.
Kamalo, tiredanddiscouraged, plodded along
through therough lavafragments piled around
theentrance tothecave. Hebore across his
shoulders ablack pig,which hehadcarried many
miles asanofifering towhatever power hecould
find toaidhim. Ashecame near tothecave
thewatchmen sawhimandsaid:—
"E, herecomes aman, food forthegreat
[shark] Mano. Fish forKauhuhu." ButKa-
malocame nearer and forsome reason aroused
sympathy inthedragons. "Ehele!Ehele!"
they cried tohim. "Away, away! Itisdeath
toyou. Here's thetabu place." "Death it
maybe—life itmay be.Givemerevenge for
mysons—andIhavenocare formyself." Then
thewatchmen asked about histrouble andhe
toldthemhowthechiefKupa had slain hissons
asapunishment forbeating thedrums. Then
henarrated thestory ofhiswanderings allover
Molokai, seeking forsomepower strong enough
toovercome Kupa. Atlasthehadcome tothe
shark-god—asthe final possibility ofaid. If
Kauhuhu failed him,hewasready todie;indeed
hehadnowish tolive.Themo-o assured himof


KAUHUHU, THESHARK-GOD OFMOLOKAI53
their kindly feelings, andtoldhimthat itwasa
verygood thing thatKauhuhu wasaway fishing,
for ifhehadbeenhome there would havebeen
noway forhim togobefore thegodwithout
suffering immediate death. There would have
been notevenaninstant forexplanations. Yet
theyranavery great riskinaiding him, forthey
must conceal him until thewaywasopened by
thefavors ofthegreat gods. Ifheshould be
discovered andeaten before gaining theaidof
theshark-god, they, too,must diewith him.
They decided thattheywould hidehim inthe
rubbish pile oftaro peelings which hadbeen
thrown ononesidewhen theyhadpounded taro.
Here hemust lieinperfect silence until theway
wasmade plain forhim toact.They toldhim
towatch forthecoming ofeight great surfwaves
rolling infrom thesea,andthen waitfrom his
place ofconcealment forsome opportunity to
speak tothegodbecause hewould come inthe
lastgreat wave. Soon thesurfbegan torollin
andbreak against the cliffs.
Higher andhigher rose thewaves until the
eighth reared farabove thewaters andmet
thewinds from theshore which whipped the
curling crest intoashower ofspray. Itraced
along thewater andbeat farupinto thecave,
breaking intofoam, outofwhich theshark-god
emerged. Atoncehetook hishuman formand


54LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
walked around thecave. Ashepassed therub-
bishheaphecried out:"Aman ishere. Ismell
him." Thedragons earnestly denied thatany
onewasthere, buttheshark-god said,"There is
surely aman inthiscave. IfIfindhim,deadmen
you are. IfIfindhim not,you shall live."
ThenKauhuhu looked along thewalls ofthecave
andinto allthehiding-places, butcould notfind
him.Hecalled with aloud voice, butonly the
echoes answered, likethevoices ofghosts. After
athorough search hewasturning away toattend
toother matters when Kamalo's pigsquealed.
Then thegiant shark-god leaped tothepileof
taroleavings andthrust them apart. There lay
Kamalo andtheblack pigwhich hadbeenbrought
forsacrifice.
Oh,theanger ofthegod!
Oh,theblazing eyes!
Kauhuhu instantly caught Kamalo andhfted
himfrom therubbish uptoward hisgreat mouth.
Now theheadandshoulders areinKauhuhu's
mouth. Soquickly has thisbeen done that
Kamalo hashadnotime tothink. Kamalo
speaks quickly astheteeth arecoming down
upon him."EKauhuhu, listen tome.Hear
myprayer. Then perhaps eatme." Theshark-
god isastonished anddoesnot bite.Hetakes
Kamalo from hismouth andsays: "Well foryou
thatyouspoke quickly. Perhaps youhave a

good thought. Speak." Then Kamalo told
about hissonsand their death atthehands of
theexecutioners ofthegreat chief, andthatno
onedared avenge him,butthat alltheprophets
ofthedifferent godshadsenthimfromoneplace
toanother butcould givehimnoaid. Surenow
washethatKauhuhu alone could givehim aid.
Pitycame totheshark-god asithadcome tohis
dragon watchers when theysawthesadcondi-
tionofKamalo. AllthistimeKamalo hadheld
thehogwhich hehadcarried withhimforsacrifice.
Thishenowofiered totheshark-god. Kauhuhu,
pleased andcompassionate, accepted theoffering,
andsaid:"EKamalo. Ifyouhadcome forany
other purpose Iwould eatyou,butyour cause is
sacred. Iwillstand asyourkahu, yourguardian,
andsorely punish thehigh chiefKupa."
Then hetoldKamalo togototheheiau ofthe
priestwhotoldhimtoseetheshark-god, take this
priest onhisshoulders, carryhimover thesteep
precipices tohisown heiau atKaluaaha, and
thereUvewithhimasafellow-priest. They were
tobuild atabu fence around theheiau andput
upthesacred tabu staffs ofwhite tapa cloth.
Theymust collect black pigsbythefourhundred,

asmall cloud, white assnow, increasing until it
covers the little island. Then that cloud shall
cross thechannel against thewindandclimb the
mountains ofMolokai until itrestsonthehighest
peaks overthevalley whereKupa hashistemple.
"Atthattime," saidKauhuhu, "agreat rainbow

awhite cloud appeared. Itwasunlike allthe
other white clouds hehadanxiously watched dur-
ingthedreary months. Over thechannel itcame.
Itspread over the hillsides andclimbed the
mountains andrested atthehead ofthevalley
belonging toKupa. Then thewatchers sawthe
glorious rainbow andknew thatKauhuhu had
come according tohisword.
Thestorm arose atthehead ofthevalley. The
winds struggled intoafurious gale. Theclouds
gathered inheavy black masses, dark asmid-
night, andwere pierced through with terrific
flashes oflightning. The rain fell infloods,
sweeping thehUlside down intothevalley, and
rolling allthatwasbelow onward inaresistless
masstoward theocean. Down came thetorrent
upon theheiau belonging toKupa, tearing its
walls intofragments andwashing Kupa andhis
people intotheharbor atthemouth ofthevalley.
Here theshark-god had gathered hispeople.
Sharks filled thebayandfeasted uponKupa and
hisfollowers until thewaters ranredand allwere
destroyed. Hence came thelegendary name for
that little harbor—Aikanaka, theplace forman-
eaters.
Itissaidinthelegends that"when great clouds
gather onthemountains andarainbow spans
thevalley, lookoutforfurious storms ofwindand
rainwhich come suddenly, sweeping down the

strange storm which came insuch awful power
uponKupa alsospread outover theadjoining
lowlands, carr5dng great destruction ever)rwhere,
but itpaused atthetabu staJBf ofKamalo, and
rushed oneither sideofthesacred fence, notdar-
ingtotouch anyonewhodwelt therein. There-
foreKamalo and hispeople were spared. The
legend hasbeen called "Aikanaka "because ofthe
feast ofthesharks onthehuman fleshsweptdown

fitting toname thestory after theshark-god
Kauhuhu, who sentmighty storms andwrought

THESTRANGE BANANA SKIN
KUKALI, according tothefolk-lore ofHawaii,
wasborn atKalapana, themost southerly
point ofthelargest island oftheHawaiian group.
Kukali lived hundreds ofyears agointhedays
ofthemigrations ofPolynesians from onegroup
ofislands toanother throughout thelength and
breadth ofthegreat Pacific Ocean. Hevisited
strange lands,nowknown under thegeneral name,
Kahiki, orTahiti. Herehekilled thegreat bird
Halulu, found thedeep bottomless pitinwhich
wasapool ofthefabled water oflife,married
thesister ofHalulu, andreturned tohisoldhome.
Allthisheaccomplished through thewonderful
power ofabanana skin.
Kukali's father wasapriest, orkahima, of
greatwisdom andability, whotaught hischildren
how toexercise strange andmagical powers. To
Kukali hegave abanana with theimpressive
charge topreserve theskinwhenever heatethe
fruit, andbecareful that itwasalways under
hiscontrol. Hetaught Kukali thewisdom of
themakers ofcanoes andalsohow toselect the
fine-grained lava forstone knives andhatchets,

andfashion theblade tothebestshape. Hein-
structed theyoungman intheprayers and in-
cantations ofgreatest efficacy andshowed him
charms which would bemore powerful thanany
charms hisenemies might useinattempting to
destroy him,andtaught himthoseomens which
were toopowerful tobeovercome. Thus Kukali
became awizard, having great confidence inhis
ability tomeet thecraft ofthewisemen ofdistant
islands.
Kukali went inland through theforests andup
themountains, carrying nofoodsavethebanana
which hisfather hadgiven him. Hunger came,
andhecarefully stripped back theskinandate
thebanana, folding theskinoncemore together.
Inalittle while theskinwas filled with fruit.
Again andagain heate,andashishunger was
satisfied the fruit always again filled theskin,
which hewascareful never tothrow away orlose.
Thefever ofsea-roving wasintheblood ofthe
Hawaiian people inthose days, and Kukali's
heart burned within himwith thedesire tovisit
thefar-away lands about which othermen told
marvelous talesandfromwhich came strangers
liketotheHawaiians inmany ways.
After awhile hewent totheforests andselected
trees approved bytheomens, andwithmany
prayers fashioned agreat canoe inwhich toem-
barkupon hisjourney. The story isnottold

Hisrestwastroubled with strange dreams, but
hisweariness wasgreatand hiseyesheavy, and
hecould notarouse himself tomeet thedangers
which were swiftly surrounding him.
Agreat birdwhich Uvedonhuman fleshwas
thegodoftheland towhich hehadcome. The
name ofthebirdwasHalulu. Each feather of
itswings wasprovided with talons andseemed
tobeendowed withhuman powers. Nothing
likethisbirdwaseverknown orseen inthebeau-
tifulHawaiian Islands. Buthere inthemyste-
rious foreign land ithad itsdeep valley, walled
inlikethevalley oftheArabian Nights, over
which thegreat birdhovered looking into the
depths forfood.Astrong wind always attended
thecoming ofHalulu when hesought thevalley
forhisvictims.
KukaU was lifted onthewings ofthebird-god
andcarried tothisholeandquietly laidonthe
ground tofinish hishour ofdeep sleep.

When Kukali awoke hefound himself inthe
shut-in valley withmany companions whohad
beencaptured bythegreat birdandplaced inthis
prison hole. They hadbeen without foodand
wereveryweak. Nowandthenoneofthenum-

KukaU pitied thehelpless state ofhisfellow-
prisoners andprepared hisbestincantations and
prayers tohelphimovercome thegreat bird.
Hetook hiswonderful banana andfed allthe
people until theywerevery strong. Hetaught
themhowtoseekstones best fitted forthemanu-
facture ofknives andhatchets. Then fordays
theyworked until theywere allwellarmed with
sharp stone weapons.
While KukaU and hisfellow-prisoners were
making preparation forthe final struggle, the
bird-god hadoften come tohisperch andput
hiswingdown into the valley, brushing the
feathers back and forth tocatch hisprey.


70LEGENDS OFGODSANDGBOSTS
Frequently thesearch was fruitless. Atlasthe
became very impatient, and sent hisstrongest
feathers along theprecipitous walls, seeking for
victims.
Kukali andhiscompanions thenranoutfrom
their hiding-places andfought thestrong feathers,
cutting them offandchopping them into small
pieces.
Halulu cried outwithpainandanger, andsent
feather after feather intotheprison. Soon one
wing was entirely destroyed. Then theother
wingwasbroken topieces andthebird-god in
hisinsane wrath putdown astrong legarmed
with great talons. Kukali uttered mighty invo-
cations andprepared sacred charms forthepro-
tection ofhisfriends.
After afierce battle they cut ofiEthelegand
destroyed thetalons. Then came thestruggle
with theremaining legandclaws, butKukaU's
friends hadbecome very bold. They fearlessly
gathered around thisenemy, hacking andpulling
until thebird-god, screaming with pain, fellinto
thepitamong theprisoners, whoquickly cutthe
body intofragments.
Theprisoners made steps inthewalls, andby
theaidofvines climbed out oftheir prison.
When theyhadfully escaped, theygathered great
piles ofbranches andtrunks oftreesandthrew
them intotheprison until thebody ofthebird-


THESTRANGE BANANA SKIN 71
godwascovered. Firewasthrown down and
Halulu wasburned toashes. ThusKukaU taught
byhischarms thatHalulu could becompletely
destroyed.
Buttwoofthebreast feathers oftheburning
Halulu flewaway tohissister,wholived inagreat
holewhich hadnobottom. Thename ofthis
sister wasNamakaeha. Shebelonged tothe
family ofPele, thegoddess ofvolcanic fires,who
hadjourneyed toHawaii andtaken upherhome
inthecrater ofthevolcano Kilauea.
Namakaeha smelled smoke onthefeathers
which came toher,andknew thatherbrother was
dead. She alsoknew thathecould have been
conquered onlybyonepossessing great magical
powers. Soshecalled tohispeople: "Who isthe
greatkupua [wizard] whohaskilledmybrother?
Oh,mypeople, keep careful watch."
KukaU wasexploring allparts ofthestrange
land inwhich hehadalready found marvelous
adventures. Byandbyhecame tothegreat

Namakaeha's priests, whohadbeenwatching, the
ropebroke andhefell.
Down hewent swiftly, but,remembering the
prayer which afallingmanmust usetokeephim

Intheancient Hawaiian mythology therewas
frequent mention of"the water oflife." Some-
times thesickbathed initandwere healed.
Sometimes itwassprinkled upon theunconscious,
bringing themback tolife. Kukali's incantation
wasofgreat power, for itthrew himintoapool

One ofthekahunas (priests) caring forNama-

THEOLDMANOFTHEMOUNTAIN
This isnotaHawaiian legend. Itwas written to
show thesuperstitions oftheHawaiians, and inthat re-
spect itisaccurate andworthy ofpreservation.
FARaway inNewEngland oneoftherugged
mountain-sides has formany years been
marked with theprofile ofagrand face.Anoble
brow, deep-set eyes, close-shut lips,Roman nose,
andchin standing infull relief against aclear
sky,made alandmark renowned throughout the
country. The story istold ofaboywho lived
inthevalley fromwhich thefaceoftheOldMan
oftheMountain could bemost clearly seen.
Astheyears passed, theboygrew intoaman
ofsterling character. When atlastdeath came
andthecasket opened toreceive thebody ofan
oldman, universally revered, thefriends sawthe
likeness tothestone features oftheOldMan of
theMountain, andrecognized thesource ofthe
inspiration which hadmade one lifeuseful and
honored.
Near Honolulu, justbeyond oneofthegreat
sugar plantations, isaledge oflava deposited


THEOLDMANOFTHEMOUNTAIN75
centuries ago.The lavawas piled upinto
mountains, nowdissolved into slopes oftherich-
estsugar-land intheworld. Andyetsometimes
thehard lava, refusing todisintegrate, thrusts
itself outfrom thehillsides inledges ofgrotesque
form.
Ononeofthese ancient lava ridges wasthe
outline ofanoldman's face, towhich theHa-
waiians have given thename, "The OldMan of
theMountain." Thelaborers onthesugar-plan-
tations, thepassengers ontherailroad trains,
andthenatives who stillcling totheir scattered
homes sometimes have looked with superstitious
aweupon thefacemade without hands. Inthe
days gonebytheyhave called itthe"Akua-
pohaku" (the stone god). Shallwehear the
story ofKamakau, who atsome time inthe
indefinite pastdwelt intheshadow ofthestone
face?
Kamakau means "the afraid." Hisname
came tohim asachild. Hewasashrinking,
sensitive, imaginative little fellow. Hewas
surrounded by influences which turned his
imagination intothepaths ofmostunwholesome
superstition. Butbeyond the beliefs ofmost
ofhisfellows, inhisownnature hewaskeenly
appreciative ofmysterious things. There was
aspirit voice inevery wind rustling thetops
ofthe trees. Spirit faces appeared inunnum-


76 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
bered caricatures ofhuman outline whenever
helayonthegrass andwatched thesunlight
siftbetween the leaves. Everything helooked
upon orheard assumed some curious form
oflife.Theclouds weremost mysterious ofall,
forthey sofrequently piledupmassuponmass
ofgrandeur, insuch luxurious magnificence and
such prodigal display ofcolor, that hispower
ofthought lost itself inhisalmost daily dream
ofsome timewandering intheshadow valleys of
theprecipitous mountains ofheaven. Here he
sawalsostrangely symmetrical forms ofmanand
birdand fish. Sometimes cloud forests outlined
themselves against theblue sky,andthen again
attimes separated bymonths andeven years, the
lights ofthevolcano-goddess, Pele, glorified her
path asshewandered inthespirit land, flashing
from cloud-peak tocloud-peak, while thethunder
voices ofthegreat gods rolled inmighty volumes
ofterrific impressiveness. Even inthenight
Kamakau feltthat theinnumerable stars were
theeyes oftheaumakuas (the spirits ofthean-
cestors). Itwasnotstrange that such achild
should continually think thathesaw spirit forms
which were invisible tohiscompanions. Itisno
wonder thathefancied heheard voices ofthe
menehunes (fairies), which hiscompanions could
never understand. Asheshrunk from places
where itseemed tohimthe spirits dwelt, his


THEOLDMANOFTHEMOUNTAIN77
companions calledhim"Kamakau," "the afraid."
When hegrew older henecessarily became keenly
alive toallobjects ofHawaiian superstition. He
never could escape theoverwhelming presence of
thethousand andmore godswhich weresupposed
toinhabit theHawaiian landandsea.Theomens
drawn from sacrifices, thevoices from thebam-
boodwelling-places oftheoracles, thechants of
theprophets, andpowers ofpraying todeath he
accepted with unquestioning faith.
Twomenwere hunting intheforests ofthe
mountains ofOahu. Tired with thelongchase
after the00,thebirdwiththerareyellow feathers
from which thefeather cloaks ofthehighest
chiefs were made, they laid aside spears and
snares andlaydown forarest. "Iwant the
valley ofthestone god," said one: "its fertile
fieldswould make justtheincrease needed formy
retainers, andthe'moi,' theking,would giveme
theland ifKamakau wereoutoftheway."
"Are thereanyothermembers ofhisfamily,
Inaina, whocould resist your claim?"
'
'No,myfriend Kokua. Heistheonlyimpor-
tant chief inthevalley."
"Pray himtodeath," wasKokua's sententious
advice.
"Good; I'lldoit,"saidInaina: "he isonewho
can easily beprayed todeath, 'The Afraid'
willsoon die."

"Ifyouwillgivemethesmall fish-pond nearest
myowncoral fish-walls Iwillbeyourmessenger,"
saidKokua.
"Ah, that also isgood," repUed Inama, after
amoment's thought. "Iwillgiveyouthesmall
pond, andyoumust give thesmall thoughts,
thehints, tohisfriends thatpowerful priests are
praying Kamakau todeath. Allthismust be
very mysterious. Noname canbementioned,
andyouandImustbeKamakau's good friends."
Itmust beremembered that land tenure in
ancient Hawaii wasahnost thesame asthat of
theEuropean feudal system. Occupancy de-
pended upon thewillofthehigh chief. Hegave
ortookaway athisown pleasure. Theunder-
chiefs heldtheland asifitbelonged tothem, and
wereseldom troubled aslong asthewishes ofthe
high chief, orking, were carried out. Inaina felt
secure intheuseofhispresent property, and
believed thathecould easily findfavorandobtain
thelandheldbytheKamakau family ifKama-
kauhimself could beremoved. Without much
further conference thetwohunters returned to
their homes. Inaina atonce sought hisfamily

hunter ofsacrifices toundertake thistask. This
servant ofthetemple wasusually sentoutto
findhuman sacrifices tobeslain and offered
before thegreat godsonspecial occasions. As
thedarkness came onhecrept near thegrass
house ofKamakau andwatched foranopportu-

desired things intheartofpraying todeath were
either alock ofhairfrom thehead ofthevictim
orapart ofthespittle, usually wellguarded by
thetrusted retainers whohad charge ofthe
spittoon.
Itchanced tobe"Awa night" forKamakau,
andthechief, having drunk heavily ofthedrug,
hadthrown himself onamatandrolled near the
grass walls. With great ingenuity thehunter of
sacrifices located thechiefandworked ahole
through thethatch. Then with hissharp bone

strangled. The spittoon infalling from the
retainer's handhadnotbeen overturned. Exul-
tant athissuccess, thehunter ofsacrifices sped
away inthedarkness andplaced histrophies in

wasagreat outcry inKamakau's village. The
deadbody wasfound assoon asdawn crept

went toKamakau's house with thereport of

civilization, simply frightened into the illness
ordeath bythestrong statements offriends
and acquaintances. Such isthemake-up of
theminds ofmen thatthey areeasily affected
bythemysterious suggestions ofothers. Itis
purely amatter ofmind-murder.
Itisnowonder that inthedays ofthelongago
Kamakau, moved bytheterror ofhisfriends
andhorrible suggestions ofhistwoenemies, soon
feltagreat weakness conquering him. His
natural disposition, hishabit ofseeing andhear-
inggodsand spirits ineverything around him,
made iteasy forhimtoyield tothebelief that
hewasbeing prayed todeath. Hisstrength

paralysis seemed totake possession ofhim.
Mind andbody were almost benumbed. He
wasreally inthehands ofunconscious mesmerists,
whowereputting himintoamagnetic sleep, from
which hewasnever expected toawake. Itisa
question tobeanswered onlywhen allearthly
problems have been solved. Howmany ofthe
people prayed todeath have really been dis-
sected andprepared forburial while atfirst
under mesmeric influences! Thepeople gathered
around Kamakau's thatchedhouse. Theythought
thathewould surely diebefore thenextmorning
dawned. Inaina andKokua were lying onthe

grass under theshade ofagreat candlenut-tree,
quietly talking about thespeedy success oftheir
undertaking. Alittle girlwasplaying nearthem.
ItwasKamakau's little Aloha. Thiswas allthe
name sofargiven toher. Shewas"My Aloha,"
"my dearone," toboth father andmother. She
heard aword uttered incautiously. Inaina had
spoken with theaccent ofsuccess and hisvoice
waslouder than hethought. He said,"We

child fledtoherfather. Shefound him inthe
half-unconscious state already described. She
shook him. Shecalled tohim. Shepulled his
hands, andcovered hisfacewith kisses. Her
tears poured over hishot,dryskin. Kamakau
wasaroused bytheshock. Hesatup,forgetting
alltheexpectation ofdeath.
Outthrough thedoorway heglanced toward
thewest. The sinking sunwas sending its
most glorious beams into thegrand clouds,
while justbeneath, reflecting theglory, laythe

wasmagnificent initssetting. The unruffled
brow, thenever-closing eyes, thefirm lips,stood

lesson isstillneeded inthese beautiful ocean-

Sometimes, however, they callherKaikawahine
Anuenue, orTheRainbow Maiden. The rain-

legendary lifeofKahala.
Thelegend ofKahala isworthy ofrecord init-

esting account ofanattempt todiscover and
c^ture ghosts according tothemethods sup-
posed tobeeffective bytheHawaiian witch
doctors orpriests ofthelong, longago.
Thelegends saythattherainbow-maiden had
two lovers, onefrom Waikiki, andonefrom
Kamoiliili, half-way between Manoa andWaikiki.

Bothwanted thebeautiful arch torestover their
homes, andthemaiden, thedescendant ofthe

when rendered unconscious, itwas believed
that thespirit had leftthebody, but forsome
reason hadbeen able tocome back into itand
enjoy lifeamong friends oncemore.

Kahala, therainbow-maiden, was thus re-
stored several times bytheowl-god, butwith
this last failure itseemed tobecertain that
thebody would grow cold and stiff before
the spirit could return. The spirit hastened
toand froingreat distress, trying toattract
attention.
Ifawandering spirit could interest some one
torender speedy aid, theancient Hawaiians
thought that ahuman being could place the
spirit back inthebody. Certain prayers and
incantations were very effective incalling the
spirit back toitsearthly home. TheSamoans
had thesame thought concerning therestora-
tion oflifetoonewhohadbecome unconscious,
andhadaspecial prayer, which wasknown as
theprayer oflife,bywhich thespirit wasper-
suaded toreturn into itsoldhome. TheHervey
Islanders alsohad thissame conception ofany
unconscious condition. They thought thespirit
leftthebody butwhen persuaded todosore-
turned andbrought thebodyback tolife.They
have astory ofawoman who, liketherainbow-
maiden, wasrestored tolifeseveral times.
The spirit ofKahala wasalmost discouraged.

beauty. Thusmany days passed inclosecom-
radeship between Kahala andtheyoung chief,
andtheylearned tocaregreatly foroneanother.
ButwhileKauhi lived itwasunsafe for itto
beknown thatKahala was alive. Mahana de-
termined toprovoke Kauhi topersonal combat;
therefore hesought theplaces which Kauhi, fre-
quented forsport andgambling. Bitter words
were spoken and fierce anger aroused until at
last,bytheskilful useofKahala's story,Mahana
ledKauhi toadmit thathehad killed the
rainbow-maiden andburied herbody.
Mahana saidthatKahala wasnow aliveand
visiting hissisters.
Kauhi declared that iftherewasanyonevisit-
ingMahana's home itmust beanimpostor. In
hisanger against Mahana hedetermined amore
awful death than could possibly come fromany
personal conflict. Hewassosure thatKahala
wasdead thatheoffered tobebaked alive inone
ofthenative imus, orovens, ifsheshould bepro-
duced before thekingandtheprincipal chiefs
ofthe district. Akaaka, thegrandfather of
Kahala, oneofthemountain-gods ofManoa
Valley, wastobeoneofthejudges.


HAWAIIAN GHOST TESTING 89
This proposition suited Mahana better than
aconflict, inwhich there wasapossibility of
losing hisown life.
Kauhi now feared thatsome deception might
bepractised. His proposition hadbeen so
eagerly accepted that hebecame suspicious;
therefore heconsulted thesorcerers ofhisown
family. They agreed that itwas possible for
some powerful kahuna topresent theghost of
themurdered maiden andsodeceive thejudges.
They decided that itwasnecessary tobepre-
pared totesttheghosts.
Ifitcould beshown thatghosts were present,
then theaidof"spirit catchers" from theland
ofMilu could beinvoked. Spirits would seize
these venturesome ghosts andcarrythemaway
tothe spirit-land, where special punishments
should bemeted out tothem. Itwas sup-
posed that "spirit catchers" were continually
sentoutbyMilu, king oftheUnder-world.
How could these ghosts bedetected? They
would certainly appear inhuman formandbe
carefully safeguarded. The chief sorcerer of
Kauhi's family toldKauhi tomake secretly a
thorough test. This could bedonebytaking
thelargeand delicate leaves oftheape-plant
andspreading them overtheplace where Kahala
must walkand sitbefore thejudges. Ahuman
being could nottouch these leaves socarefully


go LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
placed without tearing andbruising them.A
ghost walking upon them could notmake any
impression. Untorn leaves would condemn
Mahana totheovens tobebaked alive, andthe
spirit catchers would becalled bythesorcerers
toseize theescaped ghost andcarry itback to
spirit-land. Ofcourse, ifsome othermaid ofthe
islands hadpretended tobeKahala, that could
beeasily determined byher divine ancestor
Akaaka. The trialwas really atest ofghosts,
forthepresence ofKahala asaspirit inherformer
human likeness was allthatKauhi andhischief
sorcerer feared. The leaves were selected with
great careand secretly placed sothatnoone
should touch them butKahala. There was
great interest inthisstrange contest forahome
inaburning oven. Theimushadbeen prepared:
theholeshadbeen dug,andthestones andwood
necessary forthesacrifice laidclose athand.
Thekingandjudges were intheir places. The
multitude ofretainers stood around atarespect-
fuldistance. Kauhi andhischief sorcerer were
placed where they could watch closely every
movement ofthemaiden who should appear
before thejudgment-seat.
Kahala, therainbow-maiden, with allthe
beauty ofherpast girlhood restored toher,
drew near, attended bythetwo spirit-sisters
whohadsaved andprotected her.The spirits


HAWAIIAN GHOST TESTING 91
knew atonce theghost testbywhich Kahala
wastobetried. Theyknew alsothat shehad
nothing tofear,buttheymust notbediscovered.
The testapplied toKahala would onlymakemore
evident theproof that shewasalivinghuman
being, butthatsame testwould prove thatthey
were ghosts, and thespirit-catchers would be
called atonceandtheywould becaught and
carried away forpunishment. The spirit-sisters
could nottrytoescape. Anysuchattempt would
arouse suspicion andtheywould besurely seized.
Theghost-testing wasaserious ordeal forKahala
andherfriends.
The spirit-sisters whispered toKahala, telling
herthepurpose attending theuseoftheape
leaves andasking hertobreak asmany ofthem
oneither side ofherasshecould without at-
tracting undue attention. Thus shecould aid
herowncause andalsoprotect thesister-spirits.
Slowly andwith great dignity thebeautiful
rainbow-maiden andherfriends passed through
thecrowds ofeager attendants totheir places
before theking. Kahala bruised andbroke as
many oftheleaves asshecould quietly. She
wasrecognized atonce asthechild ofthedivine
rainandwind ofManoa Valley. There wasno
question concerning herbodily presence. The
torn leaves afforded ample and indisputable
testimony.


92 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Kauhi, indespair, recognized the girlwhom
hehadseveral times tried toslay. Inbitter dis-
appointment atthefailure ofhisghost-test the
chief sorcerer, astheKalakaua version ofthis
legend says, "declared that hesawand felt
thepresence ofspirits insomemanner connected
with her." These spirits, heclaimed, must be
detected andpunished.
Asecond form ofghost-testing wasproposed by
Akaaka, themountain-god. Thiswasamethod
frequently employed throughout alltheislands
oftheHawaiian group. Itwasbelieved that
anyface reflected inapool orcalabash ofwater
wasaspirit face.Many times hadghosts been
discovered inthisway. The face inthewater
hadbeengrasped bythewatcher, crushed between
hishands, andthespirit destroyed.
The chief sorcerer eagerly ordered acalabash
ofwater tobequickly brought andplaced before
him. Inhisanxiety todetect and seize the
spirits whomight beattending Kahala heforgot
about himself andleaned overthecalabash. His
own spirit facewastheonlyonereflected onthe
svurface ofthewater. This spirit facewasbe-
lieved tobehisown true spirit escaping forthe
moment from thebodyandbathing intheliquid
before him. Before hecould leapbackand re-
store hisspirit tohisbodyAkaaka leaped for-
ward, thrust hishands down intothewater and


HAWAIIAN GHOST TESTING93
seized andcrushed this spirit facebetween his
mighty hands. Thus itwasdestroyed before it
could return toitshome offleshandblood. .
The chief sorcerer felldeadbytheside ofthe
calabash bymeans ofwhich hehadhoped tode-
stroy thefriends oftherainbow-maiden.
Inthis trial oftheghosts thetwomost power-
fulmethods ofmaking atest asfarasknown
among theancient Hawaiians were put in
practice.
Kauhi waspunished forhiscrimes against
Kahala. Hewasbaked alive intheimu pre-

Thegod said,"Lono, open yourmouth!"
ThisLono did,andthegodspat inhismouth, so
that thesaliva could betaken intoevery part
ofLono's body. Thus apart ofthegodbecame
apart ofLono, andhebecame very skilful inthe
useofallhealing remedies. Helearned about
thevarious diseases andthemedicines needed

Lono receiving new lessons along theway, pass-

andthen toHamakua.
Thegod said,"It isnotright forustostay

Lono turned aside todwell inWaimanu and
Waipio Valleys and there began topractise

Kamaka made hishome atKu-kui-haele.
Thisgoddidnot telltheother gods ofthe

ofLono. Some hadbeen sickeven todeath,
andLono hadhealed them. Therefore Milu

came andslapped Milu allover thebody, and
said:"You arenot ill.Obeymeandyou shall

Then hehealed himfrom allthesickness in-

Some ofthe spirits were abready grouped in

KALAI-PAHOA, THEPOISON-GOD
THEBishop Museum ofHonolulu hasoneof
thebestaswellasoneofthemost scientifi-
cally arranged collections ofHawaiian curios in
theworld. Initareimages ofmany ofthegods
oflong ago.One ofthese isahelmeted head
made ofwicker-work, overwhich hasbeenwoven
athick covering ofbeautiful red feathers
bordered with yellow feathers. Thiswas the
mighty war-god ofthegreat Kamehameha.
Another isasquat rough image, crudely carved
outofwood. ThiswasKamehameha's poison-
god.
The ancient. Hawaiians were acquainted with
poisons ofvarious kinds. They understood the
medicinal qualities ofplants andfound some of
these strong enough tocause sickness andeven
death. One oftheHawaiian writers said:"The
opihi-awa isapoison shell-fish. These arebitter
anddeadly andcanbeused inputting enemies
todeath. Kalai-pahoa isalsoatree inwhich
there isthepower tokill."
Kamehameha's poison-god was called Kalai-
pahoa, because itwascutfrom that treewhich


KALAI-PAHOA, THEPOISON-GOD 109
grew intheupland forest ontheisland of
Molokai.
Anative writer saystherewasanantidote for
thepoison from Kalai-pahoa, andhethus de-
scribes it:"The war-god andthepoison-god were
not leftstanding inthetemples liketheimages
ofother gods, but after being worshipped were
wrapped inkapaand laidaway.
"When thepriest wanted Kalai-pahoa hewas
taken down andanointed with cocoanut-oil and
wrapped inafresh kapa cloth. Then hewas
setupabove the altar andafeast prepared
before him,awa todrink, andpig, fish,andpoi
toeat.
"Then thepriest whohad special care ofthis
godwould scrape offalittlefrom thewood, and
put itinanawacup,andholdthecupbefore the
god,chanting aprayer forthelifeoftheking, the
government, andthepeople. One ofthepriests
would then talcetheawacup,drink thecontents,
andquickly take food.
"Those whowerewatching would presently see
aredflush creep over hischeeks, growing stronger
andstronger, while theeyeswould become glassy
andthebreath short likethat ofadying man.
Then thepriest would touch hislipstothestick,
Mai-ola, andhave his liferestored. Mai-ola
wasagodwhohadanother tree.When Kalai-
pahoa entered his treeonMolokai, Mai-ola


no LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
entered another treeandbecame theenemy of
thepoison-god."
Thepriests ofthepoison-god wereverypower-
fulinthecurious rite called pule-ana-ana, or
praying todeath. TheHawaiians said: "Per-
haps thepriests ofKalai-pahoa putpoison in
bananas orintaro. Itwasbelieved thatthey
scraped thebody oftheimage andputthepieces
inthefood oftheonetheywished topray to
death. There wasonechiefwhowasvery skilful
inwaving kahihs, orfeather fans, overanyone
andshaking thepowder ofdeath intothefood

whatever food hisenemy was eating." The
spirit ofdeath wassupposed toreside inthewood

chief,whowasavery great gambler. Hehad
gambled away allhispossessions. While hewas
sleeping, thenight ofhisfinal losses, heheard
some one call,"0Kane-ia-kama, begin your
play again." Heshouted outintothedarkness:
"Ihave beteverything. Ihavenothing left."
Then thevoice again said,"Bet your bones,
betyour bones, andseewhat willhappen."
When hewent tothegambling-place thenext
daythepeople alllaughed athim, fortheyknew
hisgoods were allgone. Hesatdown among
them, however, and said:"Itrulyhave nothing
left.Mytreasures are allgone, butIhavemy
bones. Ifyouwish, Iwillbetmybody, then I
willplaywithyou."
Theother chiefs scornfully placed some prop-
ertyononesideand said,"That willbeofthe
same value asyour bones."


112LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
They gambled andhewon. The chiefs were
angry attheir lossandbetagain andagain. He
always won untilhehadmore wealth thanany
oneontheisland.
After thegambling days were overheheard
again thesame voice saying: "0Kane-ia-kama,
youhavedone allthatItoldyouandhavebecome
very rich inproperty and servants. Willyou
obey oncemore?"
The chief gratefully thanked thegodforthe
aidthathehadreceived, andsaidhewould obey.
Thevoice then said:"Perhaps wecanhelpyou
toonething. You arenowwealthy, butthere is
alast giftforyou.Youmust listen carefully
andnote allIshow you."
Then thisgodofthenight pointed outthe
trees intowhich thegodshadentered when they
decided toremain foratime intheforest, and
explained tohim alltheir different characteris-
tics.Heshowed himwhere godsandgoddesses
dwelt andgave their names. Then heordered
Kane-ia-kama totake offerings ofpigs, fish, co-
coanuts, bananas, chickens, kapas, and allother
things used forsacrifice, andplace them atthe
roots ofthese trees intowhich thegodshad
entered, theproper offerings foreach.
Thenextmorning hewent intotheforest and
sawthathehadreceived avery careful description
ofeach tree.Heobserved carefully the tree


KALAI-PAHOA, THEPOISON-GOD 113
shown asthehome ofthespiritwhohadbecome
hisstrange helper.
Before night fellheplaced offerings ascom-
manded. Asaworshipper hetookeachoneof
these trees forhisgod, sohehadmany gods of
plants and trees.
Forsome reason notmentioned inthelegends
hesentwoodcutters tocutdown these trees, or
atleast tocutgodsoutofthem with their stone
axes.
They began tocut.Thekoko (blood) ofthe
trees, asthenatives termed theflowing sap,
and thechips fl3ang outstruck some ofthe
woodcutters andthey felldead.
Kane-ia-kama made cloaks ofthelong leaves
ofthe ieievineand tiedthem around hismen,
sothat their bodies could notbetouched, then
theworkwaseasily accomplished.
The chief kept these images ofgods cutfrom
themedicinal treesandcould usethem ashe
desired. Themostpowerful ofallthese godswas
thatonewhose voice hehadheard inthenight.
Tothisgodhegave thename Kalai-pahoa (The-
one-cut-by-the-pahoa-or-stone-axe).
Oneaccount relates that thepahoa (stone)
fromwhich theaxewasmadecamefrom Kalakoi,
acelebrated place forfinding averyhard lava of
fine grain, thevery best formaking stone
implements.


114LEGENDS OFGODSANDGBOSTS
Thegodwhohadspoken tothechief inhis
dream wassometimes called Kane-kulana-ula
(noted redKane).
Thegodswerecaught bythesacrifices ofthe
chief while theywere intheir treebodies before
they could change back into their spirit bodies,
therefore theirpower wassupposed toremain in
thetrees.
Itwassaidthatwhen Kane-kulana-ula changed
into histreeform heleaped into itwith atre-
mendous flash oflightning, thus thegreatmana,
ormiraculous power, went intothat tree.
Thestrange death which came from thegod
Kalai-pahoa made thatgodandhispriest greatly
feared. One ofthepieces ofthis tree fellinto
aspring atKaakee near themaika, ordisc-roll-
ingfield,onMolokai. Allthepeople whodrank
atthat spring died. They filled itupandthe
chiefs ruled that thepeople should notkeep
branches orpieces ofthetree fortheinjury of
others. Ifsuch pieces were found inthepos-
session ofanyoneheshould die.Only thecarved
godswere tobepreserved.
Kahekili, king ofMaui atthetime ofthe
accession ofKamehameha tothesovereignty of
theisland Hawaii, hadthese images inhispos-
session asapart ofhishousehold gods.
Kamehameha sentaprophet toaskhim for
one ofthese gods. Kahekili refused tosend

one,buttoldhimtowaitandheshould have
thepoison-god andthegovernment over allthe
islands.
Oneaccount records that asmall partfrom
thepoison onewasthen given.
So,after thedeath ofKahekili, Kamehameha
didconquer alltheislands with their hosts of
gods, and Kalai-pahoa, thepoison-god, came
intohispossession.
Theoverthrow ofidolatry andthedestruction

KE-AO-MELE-MELE, THEMAID OF
THEGOLDEN CLOUD
THEHawaiians never found gold intheir
islands. Themountains being ofrecent
volcanic origin donotshow traces oftheprecious
metals; buthovering over themountain- tops
clustered theglorious golden clouds builtupby
damp winds from theseas. TheMaiden ofthe
Golden Cloud belonged tothecloud mountains
andwasnamed after their golden glow.
Hername intheHawaiian tongue wasKe-ao-
mele-mele (The Golden Cloud). Shewas said
tobeoneofthefirstpersons brought bythegods
tofindahome intheParadise ofthePacific.
Intheancient times, theancestors ofthe
Hawaiians came from far-off ocean lands, for
which theyhad different names, such asThe
Shining Heaven, The Floating Land ofKane,
The Far-off White Land ofKahiki, andKuai-
he-lani (purchased isheaven). Itwasfrom
Kuai-he-lani that theMaiden oftheGolden
Cloud was called tolive inHawaii.
Inthis legendary land lived Mo-o-inanea
(self-reliant dragon). Shecared forthe first


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 117
children ofthegods, oneofwhom wasnamed
Hina, laterknown inPolynesian mythology as
Moon Goddess.
Mo-o-inanea took hertoKu,oneofthegods.
They lived together many yearsandafamily of
children came tothem.
Two ofthegreat gods ofPolynesia, Kaneand
Kanaloa, hadfound abeautiful place above
Honolulu onOahu, oneoftheHawaiian Islands.
Here theydetermined tobuild ahome forthe
first-born child ofHina.
Thousands ofeepa (gnome) people lived
around this place, which wascalled Waolani.
Thegodshadthem build atemple which was
alsocalled Waolani (divine forest).
When thetimecame forthebirth ofthechild,
clouds andfogs crept over theland, thunder
rolled andlightning flashed, redtorrents poured
down thehillsides, strong winds hurled therain
through bending trees, earthquakes shook the
land, huge waves rolled inland from the sea.
Then abeautiful boywasborn. Allthese signs
taken together signified thebirth ofachief of
thehighest degree—even ofthefamily ofthe
gods.
Kane andKanaloa sent their sister Anuenue
(rainbow) togetthechild ofKuandHina that
theymight care for it.Allthree should bethe
caretakers.


Il8'LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Anuenue went first tothe place where
Mo-o-inanea dwelt, toaskher ifitwould be
right. Mo-o-inanea saidshemight go,but if
theybrought upthat child hemust nothave a
wifefrom any ofthewomen ofHawaii-nui-
akea (great wide Hawaii).
Anuenue asked, "Suppose Igetthat child;
who istogive ittheproper name?"
Mo-o-inanea said:"You bring thechild toour
brothers andthey willname this child. They
have sentyou,andtheresponsibility ofthename
restsonthem."
Anuenue saidgood-by, and inthetwinkling
ofaneyestood atthedoor ofthehouse where
Kudwelt.
Kulooked outside andsawthebright glow of
therainbow, butnocloud orrain, sohecalled
Hina. "Here isastrange thing. Youmust
comeandlook atit.There isnorainandthere
arenoclouds ormist, butthere isarainbow at
ourdoor."
Theywent out,butAnuenue hadchanged her
rainbow bodyandstood before them asavery
beautiful woman, wrapped only inthecolors of
therainbow.
KuandHinabegan toshiver withanameless
terror asthey looked atthisstrange maiden.
They faltered outawelcome, asking hertoenter
their house.


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 119
Asshecame near tothemKusaid,"From
what place doyoucome?"
Anuenue said: "Iamfrom thesky,ames-
senger sentbymybrothers togetyour child
thattheymay bring itup.When grown, ifthe
child wants itsparents, wewillbring itback.
Ifitloves usitshall staywith us."
Hinabowed herheadandKuwailed, both
thinking seriously foralittle while. ThenKu
said: "IfMo-o-inanea hassentyou sheshall
have the child. Youmay take thisword to
her."
Anuenue replied: "Ihave justcome from her
andtheword Ibrought you isherword. IfI
goaway Ishallnotcome again."
Hina said toKu:"Wemust give this child
according toherword. Itisnotright todis-
obey Mo-o-inanea."
Anuenue took thechildandstudied theomens
foritsfuture, thenshesaid,"This child isofthe
very highest, theflower onthetopofthetree."
Sheprepared totake thechildaway, andbade
theparents farewell. Shechanged herbody into
theoldrainbow colors shining outofamist, then
shewrapped thechild intherainbow, bearing it
away.
KuandHinawent outlookmg upandwatch-
ingthecloud ofrainbow colors floating inthe'
sky. Strong, easywinds blewandcarried this

cloud outover theocean. Thenavel-string had
notbeen cut off,soAnuenue broke offpartand
threw itinto theocean, where itbecame the
Hee-makoko, ablood-red squid. This isthe
legendary origin ofthatkind ofsquid.
Anuenue passed overmany islands, coming at
last toWaolani tothetemple built bythe
gnomes under Kane andKanaloa. They con-
secrated thechild, andcut ofianother part of
thenavel-cord. Kanaloa took ittotheNuuanu
paliback ofHonolulu, totheplace called Ka-
ipu-o-Lono. KaneandKanaloa consulted about
servants tolivewith theboy,anddecided that
theymust have only ugly ones,whowould not
bedesired aswives bytheir boy. Therefore
they gathered together thelame, crooked, de-
formed, and blind among thegnome people.
There werehundreds ofthese living indifierent
homes, andperforming different tasks. Anuenue
wastheruler over allofthem. This childwas
named Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (the oneadopted
bythegods). Hewasgiven averyhigh tabu
byKane andKanaloa. Noonewasallowed to
stand before himandnoperson's shadow could
fallupon him.
Hina again conceived. Thesigns ofthischild
appeared intheheavens andwere seenonOahu.
Kane wanted tosend Lanihuli andWaipuhia,
their daughters, living near thepali ofWaolani

Kane said:"WesendyoutothelandKuai-he-

They looked andsawagreat bird—Iwa. They
gotonthisbirdandwere carried farupinthe

times. The girls were frightened andlooking
down sawthebright shining land Kuai-he-lani
below them. Thebirdtookthem tothedoor of
Ku's dwelling-place.
KuandHina were caring forabeautiful girl-
baby. They looked upandsawtwo finewomen
attheir door. They invited them inandasked
whence theycameandwhythey travelled.
The girls toldthem theywere sentbythegods
KaneandKanaloa. Suddenly anewvoicewas
heard. Mo-o-inanea wasbythehouse. She
called toKuand toHina, telling them togive
thechild into thehands ofthestrangers, that
theymight take hertoWaka, agreat priestess,
tobebrought upbyherintheohia forests of
theisland ofHawaii. Shenamed that girlPali-
ula,andexplained totheparents thatwhen


122LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Paliula should grow up,tobemarried, theboy
ofWaolani should beherhusband. The girls
then took thebabe. They were allcarried by
thebird, Iwa, faraway intheskytoWaolani,
where they toldKane andKanaloa themessage
orprophecy ofMo-o-inanea.
Thegods sentIwawith thechild toWaka, on
Hawaii, toherdwelling-place inthe districts
ofHiloandPuna where shewascaring forall
kinds ofbirds inthebranches ofthetreesand
among theflowers.
Waka commanded thebirds tobuild ahouse
forPaliula. Thiswasquickly done. Shecom-
manded thebirdIwa togotoNuumea-lani, a
far-off landabove Kuai-he-lani, theplace where
Mo-o-inanea wasnow living.
ItwassaidthatWaka, byhermagic power,
saw inthat landtwo trees, well cared forby
multitudes ofservants; thename ofonewas
"Makalei." This was atree for fish. All
kinds offishwould gotoit.Thesecond was
"Kalala-ika-wai." Thiswasthetreeused for
getting allkinds offood. Call this treeand
foodwould appear.
Waka wanted Mo-o-inanea tosend these trees
toHawaii.
Mo-o-inanea gave these trees toIwa,who
brought them toHawaii andgavethem toWaka.
Waka rejoiced andtook care ofthem. The


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 123
birdwent back toWaolani, telling Kane and
Kanaloa allthejourney from first tolast.
Thegodsgave the girls resting-places inthe
fruitful lands under theshadow ofthebeautiful
Nuuanu precipices.
Waka watched over Paliula until shegrew
up,beautiful like themoon ofMahea-lani
(fullmoon).
The fish tree, Makalei, which made thefish
ofallthatregion tame, wasplanted bytheside
ofrunning water, invery restful places spreading
allalong theriver-sides totheseashore. Fish
came toevery stream where thetrees grew, and
fiUed thewaters.
Theother treewasplanted andbrought pre-
pared food for Paliula. The hidden land
where thisplace was hasalways been called
Paliula, abeautiful green spot—ahome for
fruitsandflowers andbirds inaforest wilderness.
When Paliula hadgrown up,Waka went to
Waolani tomeetKane, Kanaloa, andAnuenue.
There shesawKahanai-a-ke-Akua (theboy
brought upbythegods) anddesired him for
Paliula's husband. There wasnoman so
splendid andnowoman sobeautiful asthese
two.The caretakers decided that theymust
behusband and wife.
Waka returned totheisland Hawaii topre-
pare forthecoming ofthepeople from Waolani.


124 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Waka builtnewhouses finerandbetter than
the first, andcovered them with theyellow
feathers oftheMamo birdwith thecolors ofthe
rainbow resting over. Anuenue hadsentsome
ofherowngarments ofrainbows.
ThenWaka went again toWaolani totalk
withKaneandKanaloa andtheir sister Anuenue.
They said toher:"You return, andAnuenue
willtakeKahanai and follow. When thenight
oftheir arrival comes, lightning willplay over
allthemountains above Waolani andthrough
theatmosphere allaround thetemple, even to
Hawaii. After awhile, around yourhome the
leaves ofthetrees willdance and singandthe
ohia-trees themselves bendbackandforth shak-
ingtheir beautiful blossoms. Then youmay
know that theRainbow Maiden andtheboy
arebyyourhome ontheisland ofHawaii.
Waka returned toherhome inthetangled
forest above Hilo. There shemetheradopted
daughter andtoldherabout thecoming ofher
husband.
Soon thenight ofrolling thunder andflashing
lightning came. The people ofalltheregion
around Hilowere filled with fear. Kane-hekih
(flashing lightning) was amiraculous body
which Kane hadassumed. Hehadgone before
theboyandtherainbow, flashing hiswaythrough
theheavens.


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 125
The gods hadcommanded Kane-hekUi to
dwell intheheavens inallplaces wherever the
gods desired him tobe,sothathecould go
wherever commanded. Healways obeyed with-
outquestioning.
Thethunder andlightning played overocean
andland while thesunwassetting beyond the
islands inthewest.
After atime thetrees bent over, theleaves
danced andchanted their songs. The flowers
made aglorious halo astheyswayed backand
forth intheir dances.
Kane toldtheRainbow Maiden totake their
adopted child toHawaii-nui-akea.
When shewasready, sheheard herbrothers
calUng thenames oftreeswhich were togowith
heronherjourney. Some ofthelegends say
thatLaka, thehula-god, wasdancing before the
two. Thetreepeople stood before theRainbow
Maiden andtheboy,ready todance alltheway
toHawaii. The treepeople arealways restless
and inceaseless motion. Thegods toldthem
tosing together anddance. Two ofthetree
people were women, Ohia and Lamakea.
Lamakea isanative whitewood tree. There
arelarge trees atWaialae inthemountains of
theisland Oahu. Ohia isatreealways fullof
fringed redblossoms. They were very beauti-
fulintheir wind bodies. They were kupuas,

orwizards, andcould bemoving trees ordancing
women asthey chose.
TheRainbow Maiden took theboy inher
armsupintothesky,andwith thetreepeople
went onherjourney. She crossed over the
islands tothemountains oftheisland Hawaii,
thenwentdown tofindPaUula.
Sheplaced thetreepeople around thehouse
todance andsingwith softrustling noises.
Waka heard thechants ofthetreepeople and
opened thedoor oftheglorious house, calling for
Kahanai tocome in.When Paliula saw
him, herheart fluttered with trembling delight,
forsheknew thissplendid youth wasthehusband
selected byWaka, theprophetess. Waka called
thetwo trees belonging toPaliula tobring
plenty offishandfood.
ThenWaka andAnuenue lefttheir adopted
children inthewonderful yellow feather house.
Thetwoyoung people, when left together,
talked about their birthplaces andtheir parents.
Paliula firstasked Kahanai about hislandand
hisfather andmother. Hetoldherthathewas
thechild ofKuandHina from Kuai-he-lani,
brought upbyKane andtheother gods at
Waolani.
The girlwent outandaskedWaka about her
parents, andlearned that thiswasherfirst-born
brother, whowas tobeherhusband because


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 127
theyhadveryhigh divine blood. Their descend-
antswould bethechiefs ofthepeople. This
marriage wasacommand from parents and
ancestors andMo-o-inanea.
Shewent intothehouse, telling thebrother
whoshewas,andthewish ofthegods.
After tendays theywere married and lived
together along time.
Atlast,Kahanai desired totravel allaround
Hawaii. Inthisjourney hemetPoliahu, the
white-mantle girlofMauna Kea, thesnow-cov-
eredmountain oftheisland Hawaii.
Meanwhile, inKuai-he-lani, KuandHina
were living together. OnedayMo-o-inanea
called toHina, telling herthat shewould bethe
mother ofamore beautiful andwonderful child
than herother twochildren. This child should
Uve inthehighest places oftheheavens and
should have amultitude ofbodies which could
beseenatnight aswellasintheday.
Mo-o-inanea wentaway toNuumea-lani and
built avery wonderful house inKe-alohi-lani
(shining land), ahouse always turning around
bydayandbynight liketheevermoving clouds,
indeed, itwas built ofallkinds ofclouds and
covered with fogs. There shemade aspring
offlowing water andput itoutside forthecoming
child tohave asabath. There sheplanted the
seeds ofmagic flowers, Kanikawi andKanikawa,

legendary plants ofoldHawaii. Then she
went toKuai-he-lani andfoundKuandHina
asleep. Shetook achild outofthetopofthe
head ofHina and carried itaway tothenew
home, naming itKe-ao-mele-mele (the yellow
cloud), theMaiden oftheGolden Cloud, awon-
derfully beautiful girl.
Noonewithahuman bodywaspermitted to
come tothisland ofNuumea-lani. Nokupuas
were allowed tomake trouble forthechild.
The ao-opua (narrow-pointed clouds) were
appointed watchmen serving Ke-ao-mele-mele,
theMaiden oftheGolden, Cloud.
Alltheother clouds were servants: theao-
opua-ka-kohiaka (morning clouds), ao-opua-
ahiahi (evening clouds), ao-opua-aumoe (night
clouds), ao-opua-kiei (peeking clouds), ao-opua-

surface ofseaorclouds along thehorizon), ka-
lani-opua (clouds upabove horizon), ka-ma-
kao-ka-lani (clouds intheeyeofthesun), ka-
wele-lau-opua (clouds highest inthesky).
Allthese clouds were caretakers watching for
thewelfare ofthat girl. Mo-o-inanea gavethem
their laws forservice.

ShetookKu-ke-ao-loa (thelongcloud ofKu)

Then therewastheopua-alii, cloud-chief with
thename Ka-ao-opua-ola (the sharp-pointed

tronomer, never weary, never tired, knowing

Shemade this child theheir ofallthedivine
islands, therefore shewasable toknow what
wasbeing done everywhere. Sheunderstood
howtheKahanai hadforsaken hissister tolive
with Poliahu. Soshewent toHawaii toaid
hersister Paliula.
When Mo-o-inanea hadtaken thechild from
thehead ofHina,KuandHina were aroused.
Kuwent outandsawwonderful cloud images
standing near thehouse, likemen.Kuand
Hinawatched these clouds shining andchanging
colors inthelight ofthedawn, asthesunap-

werearound them. Then inthemidst ofthese
clouds appeared astrange land oftheskies sur-
rounded bytheao-opua (the narrow-pointed
clouds). Inthenight ofthefullmoon, theaka
(ghost) shadow ofthatland leaped upintothe
moon andbecame fixed there. Thiswasthe
Alii-wahine-o-ka-malu (thequeen ofshadows),
dwelling inthemoon.
KuandHina didnotunderstand themeaning
ofthese signs orshadows, sotheywentback into
thehouse, falling intodeep sleep.
Mo-o-inanea spoke toHina inherdreams, say-
ingthat these clouds were signs ofherdaughter
bornfrom thehead—agirlhaving great knowl-
edge and miraculous power insorcery, who
would takecareofthem intheir lastdays. They
must learn allthecustoms ofkilo-kilo, orsorcery.
Mo-o-inanea again sent Ku-ke-ao-loa tothe
house ofKu,that cloud appearing asaman at
their door.
They asked whohewas.Hereplied: "I
amamessenger sent toteachyouthesorcery or
witcheries ofcloud-land. Youmust have this
knowledge thatyoumayknow your cloud-
daughter. Letusbegin ourwork atthistime."
They allwent outside thehouse andsatdown

tocome with their ruler Ke-ao-mele-mele.
"Arise,Oyellow cloud,
Arise,Ocloud—theeyeofthesun.
Arise,Obeautiful daughters oftheskies.
Shine intheeyesofthesun, arisel"
Ke-ao-mele-mele aroseandputonherglorious
white kapas likethesnow onMauna Kea. At
thistime thecloudwatchmen over Kuai-he-lani
were revealing their cloud forms toHinaandKu.
TheLong Cloud toldHina andKutolook
sharply intotheskytoseethemeaning ofallthe
cloud forms which were servants ofthedivine
chiefess, their habits ofmeeting, moving, sepa-
rating, their forms, theirnumber, thestars ap-
pearing through them, thefixed starsandmoving

course ofthewindsamong thedifferent clouds.
When hehadtaughtKuandHina thesorcery
ofcloud-land, hedisappeared andreturned to
Ke-alohi-lani.
Some time afterward, Kuwent outtotheside
oftheir land. Hesawacloud ofvery beautiful
form, appearing likeawoman. Thiswasresting
intheskyabove hishead. Hina woke up,

went tohimandbyherpower toldhimthat

Abeautiful chiefess, Hiilei, wasatthattime
living inoneofthelarge islands oftheheavens.
KuandHina went tothis place. Kumarried
Hiilei, andHina found achiefnamed Olopana
andmarried him.Kuand Hiilei hadared-
skin child, aboy,whom theynamed Kau-mai-
liula (twilight resting inthesky). This child
wastaken byMo-o-inanea toKe-alohi-lani to
livewith Ke-ao-mele-mele. Olopana andHina
hadadaughter whom they called Kau-lana-iki-
pokii (beautiful daughter ofsimset), whowas
taken byKuand Hiilei.
Hina then called tothemessenger cloud to
come andcarry arequest toMo-o-inanea that
Kau-mai-liula begiven toherandOlopana.
Thiswasdone. Sotheywere allseparated from
each other, but intheendthechildren were
taken toHawaii.
Meanwhile Paliula was living above Hilo
with herhusband Kahanai-a-ke-Akua (adopted
sonofthegods). Kahanai became restless and
determined toseeother parts oftheland, sohe
started onajourney around theislands. Hesoon
metafineyoungmanWaiola (water oflife).
Waiola hadnever seenanyonesoglorious in

down before him, saying: "Ihave never seen

The chief said,"Itakeyou asmyaikane

Theywentdown toWaiakea, avillage byHilo,
andmetanumber ofgirlscovered withwreaths
offlowers and leaves. Kahanai sentWaiola
tosport with them. Hehimself was oftoo

The chief looked upMauna Keaandthere

her sisters, Lilinoe andKa-lau-a-kolea, beautiful
girls,andgave them sweet-sounding shells to
blow. Allthrough thenight theymade music
andchanted the stirring songs ofthegrand
mountains. The chief delighted inPoliahu and
livedmany months onthemountain.
Onemorning Paliula inherhome above Hilo
awoke from adream inwhich shesawPoliahu
andthechief living together, soshetoldWaka,
asking ifthedream were true. Waka, byher
magic power, looked over theisland andsaw
thethree young men living with the three
maidens ofthesnow mantle. Shecalled witha
penetrating voice forthechief toreturn tohis
ownhome. Shewent intheform ofagreat
birdandbrought himback.
ButPoliahu followed, metthechief secretly
andtookhimuptoMauna Keaagain, covering
themountain withsnow sothatWaka could
notgotofindthem.
Waka andthebird friends ofPaUula could
notreach themountain-top because ofthecold.
Waka went toWaolani andtoldAnuenue about
Paliula's trouble.
Anuenue was afraid thatKane andKanaloa
might hearthatthechiefhadforsaken hissister,


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 135
andwasmuch troubled, sosheaskedWaka to
gowithhertoseeMo-o-inanea atKe-alohi-lani,
butthegodsKane andKanaloa could not
bedeceived. They understood that there was
trouble, andcame tomeet them.
Kane toldWaka toreturn and tellthegirlto
bepatient; thechief should bepunished for
deserting her.
Waka retiurned andfound that Paliula had
goneaway wandering intheforest, picking lehua
flowers onthewayuptoward theLua Pele, the
volcano pitofPele, thegoddess offire. There
shehadfoimd abeautiful girlandtook heras
anaikane (friend) tojourney around Hawaii.
They travelled byway ofthedistricts ofPuna,
Kau,andKona toWaipio, where shesawafine-
looking man standing above aprecipice over
which leaped thewonderful mist-falls ofHiilawe.
This young chief married thebeautiful girl
friend ofPaliula.
Poliahu byherkupua power recognized
Paliula, andtoldthechief thatshesawherwith
anewhusband.
Paliula went ontoheroldhome andrested
many days. Waka thentookherfrom island to
island until theywere nearOahu. When they
came tothebeach, Paliula leaped ashore and
went uptoManoa Valley. There sherushed
intotheforest andclimbed theridges andpreci-


136 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
pices. Shewandered through therough places,
herclothes tornandragged.
Kane andKanaloa sawher sitting onthe
mountain-side. Kane sent servants tofindher
andbring hertolivewiththem atWaolani.
When shecame tothehome ofthegods in
Nuuanu Valley shethought longingly ofher
husband andsang thismele:
"Lo,atWaolani ismy leioftheblood-red rain,
The leiofthemisty raingathered andputtogether,
Puttogether inmythought with tears.
Spoiled isthebodybylove,
Dear intheeyes ofthelover.
Mybrother, thefirst-bom,
Return, oh,return,mybrother."
Paliula, chanting this,turned away fromWao-
lanitoWaianae anddwelt foratimewith the
chief essKalena.
While Paliula was living with thepeople of
thecoldwinds ofWaianae shewore leisof
mokahana berries andfragrant grass, andwas
greatly loved bythefamily. Shewentupthe
mountain toagreat gulch. Shelaydown to
sleep, butheard asweet voice saying, "You
cannot sleep ontheedge ofthat gulch." She
wasfrequently awakened bythat voice. She
wentonupthemountain-ridges above Waianae.
Atnightwhen sherested sheheard thevoices
againandagain. Thiswasthevoice ofHii-lani-
wai,whowasteaching thehula dance tothe


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 137
girls ofWaianae. Paliula wanted toseethe
onewhohadsuch asweet voice, sowent along
thepaliandcame toahulahouse, butthehouse
wasclosed tightandshecould notlook in.
She satdown outside. Soon Hii-lani-wai
opened thedoorandsawPaliula andasked her
tocome in. Itwasthe firsttime Paliula had
seen thiskind ofdancing. Her delight inthe
dance took control ofhermind, andsheforgot
herhusband andtook Hii-lani-wai asheraikane,
dwelling with herforatime.
Onedaytheywent outintotheforest. 'Kane
had sent thedancing trees from Waolani to
meet them. While intheforest theyheard the
trees singing anddancing likehuman beings.
Hii-lani-wai called thisaverywonderful thing.
Paliula toldherthatshehadseenthetrees do
thisbefore. The treesmade herglad.
They wentdown totheseaside and visited
some days. Paliula desired aboat togoto
theisland ofKauai. Thepeople toldthem of
thedangerous waters, but the girlswere stub-
born, sothey were given avery small boat.
Hii-lani-wai was steering, andPaliula waspad-
dlingandbailing outthewater. Theanger of
theseasdidnot arise. OnthewayPaliula fell
asleep, buttheboat swiftly crossed thechannel.
Their boatwascovered with allthecolors of
therainbow. Somewomen onland atlastsaw


138LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
them andbeckoned with theirhands forthem
tocome ashore.
Malu^aka (shadow ofpeace) wasthemost
beautiful ofallthewomen onKauai. Shewas
kindandhospitable andtookthem toherhouse.
Thepeople came toseethese wonderful strangers.
Paliula toldMalu-aka herstory. She rested,
with theKauai girls, thenwent withMalu-aka
over theisland andlearned thedances ofKauai,
becoming noted throughout theisland forher
wonderful grace and skill, dancing likethewind,
feetnottouching theground. Hersongs and
thesound ofthewhirling dance were liftedby
thewinds andcarried intothedreams ofKe-ao-
mele-mele.
Meanwhile, Ke-ao-mele-mele was living with
hercloud-watchmen andMo-o-inanea atKe-
alohi-lani. Shebegan tohave dreams, hearing a
sweet voice singing andseeing aglorious woman
dancing, while winds were whispering inthe
forests. Forfivenights sheheard thesongand
thesound ofthedance. Then shetoldMo-o-
inanea, whoexplained herdream, saying: "That
isthevoice ofPaliula, your sister, who isdanc-
ingandsinging near thesteep places ofKauai.
Herbrother-husband hasforsaken herandshe
hashadmuch trouble. He isliving withPoliahu
onHawaii."
When Ke-ao-mele-mele heard this,shethought


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 139
shewould goandlivewithhersister. Mo-o-ina-
neaapproved ofthethought andgaye her all
kinds ofkupua power. Shetoldhertogoand
seethegodKane,whowould tellherwhat todo.
Atlastshestarted onherjourney with her
watching clouds. Shewent toseeHina and
Olopana, andKuand Hiilei. ShesawKau-
mai-liula (twilight resting inthesky),whowas
very beautiful, likethe fairredflowers ofthe
ohia intheshadows oftheleaves ofthe tree.
Shedetermined tocome backandmarry him
after herjourney toOahu.
When sheleftKuai-he-lani with herfollowers
sheflew likeabirdover thewaves ofthesea.
Soon shepassed Niihau andcame toKauai to
theplace where Paliula was dancing, and as
acloud with hercloud friends spied outtheland.
The softmists ofhernative landwere scattered
over thepeople bythese clouds above them.
Paliula wasreminded ofherbirth-land and
theloyed people ofherhome.
Ke-ao-mele-mele sawthebeauty ofthedance
andunderstood theloveexpressed inthechant.
Sheflewaway from Kauai, crossed thechannel,
came toWaolani, metKane andKanaloa and
toldthem shehadcome tolearnfromthemwhat
wastheright thing todoforthesister andthe
husband whohaddeserted her.Kane suggested
avisit toHawaii toseePaliula andthechief,


I40 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
sosheflewover theislands toHawaii. Then
shewentupthemountain with theao-pii-kai
(acloud rising from theseaandclimbing the
mountain) until shesawPoliahu andherbeau-
tiful sisters.
Poliahu looked down themountain-side and
sawawoman coming, butshelooked again and
thewoman haddisappeared. Inalittle while
agolden cloud rested onthesummit ofthe
mountain. Itwasthemaid inhercloud body
watching herbrother andthe girlofthewhite
mountains. Formore than twenty days she
remained inthat place. Then shereturned to
Waolani onOahu.
Ke-ao-mele-mele determined tolearn the
hulas andtheaccompanying songs. Kane told
hersheought tolearn these things. There was
afine field fordancing atthefoot ofthemoun-
tain near Waolani, andKane hadplanted a
large kukui-tree byitssidetogive itshade.
Kane andhissisterAnuenue went tothis field
and satdown intheir place. Thedaughters of
Nuuanu Paliwere there. Kane sent Ke-ao-
mele-mele after the dancing-goddess, Kapo,
who lived atMauna Loa. Shewasthe sister
ofthepoison-gods andknew theartofsorcery.
Ke-ao-mele-mele took gifts,went toKapo, made
offerings, andthus forthe firsttime secured a
goddess forthehula.

Kapo taught Ke-ao-mele-mele thechants and
themovements ofthedifferent hulas until she
wasvery skilful. SheflewovertheseastoOahu
andshowed thegods her skill. Then, shewent
toKauai, danced onthesurfandintheclouds
andabove theforests and inthewhirlwinds.
Each night shewent tooneoftheother islands,
danced intheskiesandover thewaters, and
returned home. Atlastshewent toHawaii
toMauna Kea, where shesawKahanai, her
brother. Shepersuaded himtoleave themaiden
ofthesnow mantle and return toWaolani.
Paliula and herfriends had returned tothe
home withWaka, where shetaught theleaves
ofclinging vines andtheflowers andleaves on
thetender swinging branches oftheforest trees
newmotions intheir dances with themany
kinds ofwinds.
OnedayKahanai sawsignsamong thestars
and intheclouds which made himanxious to
travel, soheasked Kane foracanoe. Kane
called theeepaandthemenehune people and
toldthem tomake canoes tocarry Kahanai to
hisparents.
These boats weremade intheforests ofWao-
lani.When themenehunes finished their boat
they carried itdownNuuanu Valley toPuunui.
There they rested andmany ofthe little folk
came tohelp, taking thecanoe down, stepby


142LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
step, tothemouth oftheNuuanu stream, where
theyhadtheaidoftheriver totheocean.
Themenehunes lefttheboat floating inthe
water andwentback toWaolani. Ofthefairy
people itwas said:"No task isdifficult. Itis
thework ofonehand."
OnthewaydownNuuanu Valley themene-
hunes came toKa-opua-ua (storm cloud). They
heard theshouting ofother people andhurried
along until theymet theNamunawa people,
theeepas, carrying aboat, pushing itdown.
When they toldtheeepas that thechiefhad
already started onhisjourney with double
canoes, theeepas lefttheirboat there toslowly
decay, but itissaidthat itlasted many cent-
uries.
The people whomade thisboat were the
second class ofthe little people hving atWao-
lani,having thecharacters ofhuman beings, yet
having alsothepower ofthefairy people. These
were themen ofthetime ofKaneandthegods.
Kahanai and hisfriends were intheir boat
when astrong wind sweptdownNuuanu, carry-
ingthedryleaves ofthemountains andsweep-
ingthem intothe sea.Thewaves were white
astheboatwasblown outintotheocean. Ka-
hanai steered bymagic power, andtheboat like
lightning swept away from theislands tothe
homes ofKuandHina. Thestrong wind and


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 143
theswift current were with theboat, andthe
voyage wasthrough thewaves likeswift light-
ning flashing through clouds.
Kuand Hiilei saw theboat coming. Its
signswere intheheavens. Kucameandasked
thetravellers, "What boat isthis,andfromwhat
place has itcome?"
Kahanai said,"This boathascomefromWao-
lani, thehome ofthegodsKane andKanaloa
andofKe-ao-mele-mele."
ThenKuasked again,"Whose child areyou?"
Hereplied, "The sonofKuandHLna."
"Howmany other children inyourfamily?"
Hesaid: "There arethree ofus. Iamthe
boyandthere aretwo sisters, Paliula andKe-
ao-mele-mele. Ihavebeen sentbyKe-ao-mele-
mele togetKau-mai-liula and Kau-lana-iki-
pokii togotoOahu."
Kuandhiswifeagreed tothecallofthemes-
senger fortheirboyKau-mai-Uula.
When Kahanai sawhimheknew that there
wasnoother onesofineasthisyoungmanwho
quickly consented togotoOahu with hisservants.
Kucalled forsome beautiful redboats with
red sails, redpaddles,—everything red. Four
goodboatmen wereprovided foreach boat,men
whocame from theland ofUlu-nui—theland
oftheyellow seaandtheblack seaofKane—
andobeyed thecallofMo-o-inanea. Theyhad


144LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
kupua power. They were relatives ofKane
andKanaloa.
Thedaughter ofHina andOlopana, Kau-
lana-iki-pokii, cried togowith herbrother, but
Mo-o-inanea called forherdragon family tomake
aboat forherandordered oneofthesorcerer
dragons togowith herandguard her.They
called themost beautiful shells oftheseato
become theboats forthegirlandherattendants.
They followed theboats ofKahanai. With one
stroke ofthepaddles theboats passed through
theseasaround thehome ofthegods. With
thesecond stroke they broke through allthe
boundaries ofthegreat ocean andwith thethird
dashed into theharbor ofoldHonolulu, then
known asKou.
When theboats ofKahanai andKau-mai-liula
came tothesurf ofMamala, there wasgreat
shouting inland ofKou, thevoices oftheeepas
ofWaolani. Mists andrainbows rested over
Waolani. Themenehunes gathered ingreat
multitudes atthecallofKane,whohadseenthe
boats approaching.
Themenehune people randown toliftupthe
boats belonging totheyoung chief. Theymade
alinefromWaolani tothesea.They lifted up
theboats andpassed them fromhand tohand
without any effort, shouting with joy.
While these chiefs were going uptoWaolani,


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 145
Ke-ao-mele-mele came fromHawaii inhercloud
boats.
Kane had told themenehunes toprepare
houses quickly forher. Itwasdone likethe
motion oftheeye.
Ke-ao-mele-mele entered herhouse, rested,
andafteratime practised thehula.
The chiefs alsohadhouses prepared, which
they entered.
The shell boats found difficulty inentering
thebaybecause theother boats were intheway.
Sothey turned offtotheeastern side ofthe
harbor. Thus theancient name ofthat side
wasgiven Ke-awa-lua (thesecond harbor, or
thesecond landing-place intheharbor). Here
they landed very quietly. The shell boats be-
came very small andKau-lana andhercom-
panions tookthemandhidthem intheir clothes.
Theywent along thebeach, sawsome fish.The
attendants tookthem forthe girl. Thisgave
thename Kau-lana-iki-pokii tothatplace tothis

made thesigns ofahigh chief appear over the
girl.Theredrainandarching bowwere over

Thedragon changed herbodyandcarried the

146 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
ofKe-ao-mele-mele (themaiden ofthegolden
cloud) without theknowledge ofKane andthe
others. They heard thehula ofKe-ao-mele-mele.
Soon she feltthatsome onewas outside, and
looking sawthe girlandherfriend, with the
signs ofachief over her.
Soshecalled:
"Isthatyou,Oeyeoftheday?

Those outside heard the callandunderstood
that Ke-ao-mele-mele knew who they were.
They entered andsawherinallthebeauty of
herhighdivine blood.
They kissed. Kau-lana toldhow shehad
come. Ke-ao-mele-mele toldthedragon togo


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 147
andstayonthemountain bythebroken paliat
thehead ofNuuanu Valley. Soshewent to
theprecipice andbecame thewatchman ofthat
place. Shewasthe firstdragon ontheislands.
Shewatched withmagic power. Later, Mo-o-
inanea came withmany dragons towatch over
theislands. Ke-ao-mele-mele taught heryoung
sister thedifferent hulas andmeles, sothatthey
wereboth alike intheir power.
When theyoungmenheard hula voices inthe
other houses they thought theywould goand
seethedancers. Atthehour oftwilight Wao-
lanishook asifinanearthquake, andtherewas
thunder andlightning.
Theyoung menandAnuenue went tothe
house andsawthegirls dancing, andwondered
howKau-lana hadcomefrom thefar-off land.
Ke-ao-mele-mele foretold thefuture forthe
young people. She told Kau-lana that she
would never marry, butshould have magic
medicine power forallcoming days,andKahanai
should have thepower over allcustoms ofpriests
and sorcerers andknowledge ofsacrifices, and
should bethebosom friend ofthemedicine-
goddess. She said that theywould allgoto
Waipio, Hawaii. Kane, Kanaloa, andAnuenue
approved ofhercommands.
Ke-ao-mele-mele sentKau-lana toHawaii to
tellPaliula tocome and livewiththem atWaipio


148LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
and findKahanai once more. Kau-lana has-
tened toHawaii inher shell boat. She called,
"Omyredshellboat ofthedeep blue seaand
theblack sea,comeuptome."
The shellboatappeared onthesurface ofthe
sea, floating. The girlwas carried swiftly to
Hawaii. There shefoundWaka andPahula
apdtookthem toWaipio. They lived fora
time there, then allwent toWaolani tocom-
plete themarriage ofKe-ao-mele-mele toKau-
mai-hula.
Kane sentWaka andAnuenue forKuand
Hiilei, Hina andOlopana withMo-o-inanea to
come toOahu.
Mo-o-inanea prepared large ocean-going canoes
forthetwofamilies, butsheandherpeople went
intheirmagic boats.
Mo-o-inanea toldthem they would never
return tothese lands, butshould find their future
home inHawaii.
Waka went onKu's boat,Anuenue waswith
Hina. Kuandhisfriends looked back, theland
wasalmost lost;theysoonsawnothing until the
mountains ofOahu appeared before them.
They landed atHeeia onthenorthern side of
theNuuanu precipice, went over toWaolani,
andmet allthefamily whohadcome before.
Before Mo-o-inanea leftherland shechanged
it,shutting upalltheplaces where herfamily


THEMAID OFTHEGOLDEN CLOUD 149
hadlived. Shetold allherkupua dragon family
tocome with hertotheplace where thegods
hadgone. Thus shemade theoldlands entirely
different from any other lands, sothatno
other persons butgods orghosts could livein
them.
Then sheroseuptocome away. Theland
wascovered with rainclouds, heavy andblack.
Thelanddisappeared and isnowknown as"The
Hidden Land ofKane."
Shelanded onWestern Oahu, atWaialua, so
thatplacebecame thehome ofthedragons, and
itwas filled with thedragons fromWaialua to
Ewa.
Thiswasthecoming ofdragons totheHa-
waiian Islands.
Atthetime ofthemarriage ofKe-ao-mele-mele
andKau-mai-liula, theBeautiful Daughter of
Sunset came from theisland Hawaii bringing
thetwo trees Makalei andMakuukao, which
prepared cooked foodand fish.When sheheard
the call tothemarriage shecame with the
trees. Makalei brought great multitudes of
fishfrom alltheocean totheKoo-lau-poko
side oftheisland Oahu. Theocean was red
with thefish.
Makuukao came toNuuanu Valley with
Kau-lana, entered Waolani, andprovided plenty
offood.


150LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Then Makalei started tocomeupfrom the
sea.
Kau-lana-iki-pokii told thegodsandpeople
that there must notbeany noise when that
great treecameupfrom the sea.They must
hearandremain silent.
When thetreebegan tocome tothefoot of
the pali, themenehunes andeepas were aston-
ishedandbegan toshout withagreat voice, for
they thought thiswasamighty kupua from
Kahiki coming todestroy them.
When theyhadshouted, Makalei felldown
atthefoot ofthepalinearKa-wai-nui, and lies
there tothisday. Sothis treenever came to
Waolani andthe fishwere scattered around the
-island.
Kau-lana's wrath wasvery great, andhetold
Kane andtheothers topunish these noisy ones,
totakethemaway from thiswonderful valley
ofthegods. Hesaid,"No family ofthesemust
dwell onWaolani." Thus the fairies andthe
gnomes were driven awayandscattered overthe
islands.
Foralongtime theMaiden oftheGolden
Cloud andherhusband, Twilight Resting in
theSky, ruled over alltheislands even tothe
mysterious lands oftheocean. When death
came they laid aside theirhuman bodies and
never made use ofthem again—but asau-

Shehasheld you, thehusband ofour sister

nottakewhat belongs toanother. You stay

Kiha-wahine went toPoliahu, butcould not
fillthewater-jar. Shepoured thewater inand
filled the jar,butwhen thejarwas lifted it
became light. Shelooked back andsawthe
water lyingontheground, andherhusband far
beyond atthepit ofPele. Then shebecame
angry and called allthedragons ofMolokai,
Lanai, Maui, Kahoolawe, andHawaii.
When shehadgathered allthedragons she
wentuptoKilauea andstood ontheedge of
thecrater andcalled allthepeople below, telling
them togive herthehusband. They refused
togivePuna up,crying out:"Where isyour
husband? This isthehusband ofour sister; he
doesnotbelong toyou,Omischief-maker."
Then thedragon-goddess said,"Ifyoudonot
giveupthisman, ofatruth Iwillsend quickly
allmypeople and fillupthiscrater andcapture
allyour fires." Thedragons threw their drool-
ingsaliva inthe pit,andalmost destroyed the
fireofthepitwhere Pele lived, leaving Ka-moho-
aUi's place untouched.

Then the firemoved andbegan torisewith
great strength, burning offallthesaliva ofthe
dragons. Kiha-wahine and the rest ofthe
dragons could notstand theheat evenalittle
while, forthe firecaught themandkilled alarge
part ofthem inthat place. They tried tohide
inthe clefts ofthe rocks. The earthquakes
opened therocks andsome ofthedragons hid,
but firefollowed theearthquakes andthefleeing
dragons. Kiha-wahine ranandleaped down the
precipice intoafish-pond called bythename of
theshadow, oraka, ofthedragon, Loko-aka
(theshadow lake).
Soshewasimprisoned inthepond, husband-
less, scarcely escaping with her life.When she
wentback toMolokai shemeant tokillHinole,
because shewasveryangry forhisactinaiding
Puna toescape. Shewanted topunish him,
butHinole sawthetrouble coming from his
sister, soaroseandleaped intothesea,becoming
afishintheocean.
When hedove intotheseaKiha-wahine went
down afterhimandtried tofindhiminthesmall
andlarge coral caves, butcould notcatch him.
Hebecame theHinalea, afishdearly loved by
thefishermen oftheislands. Thedragon-goddess
continued seeking, swimming swiftly from place
toplace.
Ounauna sawherpassing backandforth, and


PUNAANDTHEDRAGON 159
said,"What areyouseeking, OKiha-wahine?"
She said, "Iwant Hinole." Ounauna said:
"Unless you listen tomeyoucannot gethim,
justaswhenyouwent toHawaii youcould not
getyourhusband from Pele. Yougoandget
thevine inalua andcome back andmake a
basket andput itdown inthesea. After awhile
divedown andyou willfindthatmanhascome
inside. Then catch him."
Thewoman took thevine,made thebasket,
camedown andput itinthesea. She left it
there alittle while, thendovedown. There was
noHinole inthebasket, butshesawhimswim-
ming along outside ofthebasket. Shewent up,
waited awhile, camedown again andsawhim
stillswimming outside. This shedidagain and
again, until hereyeswere redbecause shecould
notcatch him. Then shewasangry, andwent
toOunauna andsaid:"0slave, Iwill killyou
to-day. Perhaps you told the truth, but I
have been deceived, and willchase you until
youdie."
Ounauna said:"Perhaps weshould talkbefore
Idie. Iwantyoutotellmejustwhatyouhave
done, then Iwillknow whether youfollowed
directions. Tellmeinafewwords. Perhaps
Iforgot something."
Thedragon said,"Iamtired ofyourwords
and Iwill killyou." Then Ounauna said,


l6oLEGENDS OFCODSANDGHOSTS
"Suppose Idie,what willyoudotocorrect any
mistakes youhavemade?"
Then shetoldhow shehadtaken vines and
made abasket andused it.Ounauna said: "I

eggsand crabs, pound andmixthem together
andputthem inside thebasket. Putthemouth
ofthebasket down. Leave itforalittle while,
then divedown and findyour brother inside.
He willnotcome out,andyou can catch
him." This isthewaytheHinalea iscaught to
thisday.
After shehadcaught herbrother shetookhim
tothe.shore tokillhim,buthepersuaded her
tosethim free. This shedid,compeUing him

Kiha-wahine thenwent totheisland Maui

After Pelehadherbattle withthedragons, and
Punahadescaped according tothedirections of
Hinole, hereturned toOahu andsaw hiswife,

AfterPuna disappeared, Koubecame thenew

Thehusband wentoutfishing, andNakula-kai
went toseeherparents, Kahuli andKakela.
Thehotsunwas rising, sosheputleaves over

was asleep. She told hermother about her
condition. Kahuli awoke and turning over

daughter why shehadcome, andwhen shetold

Agirlwasborn, andthegrandparents kept the

"Fishing, fishing, your father isfishing.

Nakula-kai wentdown toherhome. Herhus-

another child was born. Hehadheard the
thunder, butnostorm. She toldhim thata
boywasbom. Nakula-uka named thatboy
Ke-au-miki (stormy orchoppy current). Ten

days afterward another boywasborn. Hewas
named Ke-au-kai (current toward thebeach).
These children hadnofoodbutawa. Their
hairwasnot cut.They were taken inside a
tabu temple andbrought up.Nakula-uka and
hiswife afteralongtimehadanother girlnamed
Hiilei (lifted likealeionthehead). Thegrand-
parents took thechild. Shewasvery beautiful
andwaskept tabu. Herhusband should be
either aking oramalekupua ofveryhigh birth.
When shehadgrown upsheheard noises below
herwoodland home several times, andshewas
very curious. Shewas told,"That comes from
thesurf-riding."
Hiilei wanted togodown and see.The
grandmother said,"Donotgo,foritwouldmean
your death." Once morecame thenoise, and
shewastold itwas"spear-throwing." The girl
wanted toknowhowthatwasdone. Thegrand-
parents warned herthat therewasgreat danger,
saying: "The path isfulloftrouble. Dragons

But Hiilei wasvery persistent, sothegrand-

quite determined togodown, but listen tome.

Sothegirlwent down, dressed gorgeously by
thegrandmother inaskirt ofrainbow colors,
flowers ofabimdant perfumes—nothing about

Shecame tothekukui grove andlooked all

shesawamist rising. Astrong windwascom-
ing.Thesunwashot inthesky,making her
cheeks red likelehua flowers. Shewent up
some highplaces looking down onthesea.Then
sheheard footsteps behind her. Shelooked

became afraid andtrembled, butsheremembered
thewords ofhergrandmother, andturned and
said,"Aloha," andthestrange thingwentaway.
Shewentonandagain heard anoiseandlooked
back.Awhirlwind wascoming swiftly after
her.Then therewasthunder andlightning.
Hiilei said:"Aloha. Whydoyoutrytomake

thatyouarearealman."
Everything passed away. Shewent onagain,
but after afewsteps she feltanearthquake.
Afraid, shesatdown. Shesawagreat thing
rising likeacloud twisting andshutting outthe
sun,moving andwrithing—agreat white piece
ofearth infront ofawhirlwind.
Shewasterribly frightened and fellfiatonthe

ofhergrandmother calling tohertosendaway
herfear, saying: "This istheoneofwhom Itold

andthewhite thing became omaomao (green).
Resolutely shestood up,shook herrainbow

l68LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
intheairandshestarted on.Then thedragons,
amultitude, surrounded her,climbing upon her
tothrow herdown. Herskinwascreeping, but
sheremembered hergrandmother and said:
"Alas, most beautiful ones, this isthe first
time Ihave everseenyou. Ifmygrandmother
were herewewould takeyouback toourhome
andentertain you,andyoushould bemyplay-

'Farewell.'"
Then thedragons disappeared andthecater-
pillars came intoview after shehadgoneona
little way. The caterpillars' eyeswere protrud-
ingasthey roseupandcame against her,but
shesaid,"Aloha."
Then shesawanother form ofKu-aha-ilo—a
stream ofblood flowing likerunning water. She
wasmore frightened than atanyother time,and
cried tohergrandfather: "EKahuli, Iam
afraid! Savemy life,mygrandfather!" He
didnotknow shehadgonedown. Hetold his
wifethathesawKu-aha-ilo surrounding some-
oneonthepath. Hewent into histemple and
prayed:
"Bom isthenight,
Bom isthemorning,
Bom isthethunder.
Bora isthelightning,
Bom istheheavy rain,
Bom istherainwhich calls us;
Theclouds oftheskygather."


KE-AU-Nim 169
Then Kahuli twisted hiskapa clothes fullof
lightning andthrew them intothesky.Afierce
andheavy rainbegan tofall. Streams ofwater
rushed toward theplace where Hiilei stood fight-
ingwiththatstream ofblood inwhich thedragon
was floating. Theblood was allwashed away
andthedragon became powerless.
Ku-aha-ilo sawthathehadfailed inallthese
attempts toterrify Hiilei. Hiseyes flashed and
heopened hismouth. Histongue wasthrusting
viciously from sidetoside. Hisredmouth was
likethepitofPele. Histeeth were gnashing,
histaillashing.
Hiilei stood almost paralyzed byfear,but re-
membered hergrandmother. She feltthatdeath
wasnearwhen shefaced thisawful body of
Ku-aha-ilo. Butshehidherfearandcalled a
welcome tothisdragon. Then thedragon fell
into pieces, which allbecame nothing. The
fragments flew inalldirections.
While Hiilei waswatching this, alltheevil
disappeared andahandsome man stood before
her. Hiilei asked him gently, "Who areyou,
andfromwhat place doyoucome?" Hesaid,
"Iamaman ofthisplace." "No," said Hiilei,
"you arenotofthis land.Mygrandparents
andIaretheonly ones. This isourland. From
what place doyoucome?" Hereplied: "Iam
truly from thelandabove theearth, andIhave


170LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
come tofindawife formyself. Perhaps you will
bemywife." Shesaidthatshedidnotwant a
husband atthat time. Shewanted togodown
tothesea.
Hepersuaded hertomarry himandthengo
down and tellherbrothers thatshehadmarried
Ku-aha-ilo. Ifaboywasbornhemust becalled
Ke-au-nini-ula-o-ka-lani (the red, restful current
oftheheavens). Thiswould betheir only child.
Hegave hersigns fortheboy, saying, "When
theboysays toyou,'Where ismyfather?' you
can tellhim, 'Here isthestick orclubKaaona
and thismalo orgirdle Ku-ke-anuenue.' He
must take these things andstart outtofindme."
Heslowly disappeared, leaving Hiilei alone. She
wentdown tothe sea.The people saw her
coming, avery beautiful woman, and they
shouted agladwelcome.
Shewent outsurf-riding, sported awhile, and
then hergrandfather came andtook herhome.
After atimecame thesigns ofthebirth ofachief.
Hersonwasbornandnamed Ke-au-nini. This
was intheland Kuai-he-lani. Kahuli almost
turned over. Thelandwasshaken and tossed.
Thiswasoneofthedivine lands fromwhich the
ancestors oftheHawaiians came. Pii-moi, a
godofthesun,asked Akoa-koa, thecoral,"What

"There isakupua—abeing with divine powers—

were intheir temple. Ke-au-kai heard thesigns

andproposed tohisbrother togooverandget

asked forthechild. Then theytook it,wrapped

Thetemple drum sounded astheycame in,

Theboygrew up.Themother after atime
wanted toseethechild, andwent tothetemple.
Shehadtowait alittle, then theboycame out
andsaidhewould sooncome toher. She re-

Hecame tohisgrandfather's house, sawan

took thiscluband lifted ittostrike theoldman,


172LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
buttheoldman caught the club. Theboy
dropped itandtried tocatch theoldman. The
oldman heldhimandaskedwhohewasandto
what family hebelonged. Theboy said: "I
belong toKahuli andKakela, toNakula-uka and
Nakula-kai. Iamtheson ofKu-aha-ilo and
Hiilei. Ihave beenbrought upbyKe-au-miki
andKe-au-kai. Iseekmymother."
Theoldman arose, took hisdrum andbeat it.
Hiilei andhermother came outtomeet theboy.
They put sacrifices intheir temple forhimand
chanted totheir ancestor-gods:
"OKeke-hoa lani,dwell here;
Here arewindandrain."
ByandbyKe-au-nini asked hismother, "Where

Hismother said:"Ifyoumake amistake, your

looked upintothesky.
Hesawwonderful things. Along object

hands, saying, "How can Iride inthissmall
canoe?"
Hewentdown tothesea,putthebarkboat in

ashelistened hesawagirlfloating inthesurf.
Heturned hisboatandjoined her. Shetoldhim

When shelearned that thiswasher half-

Ifheawoke, theboywould bekilled.
Theboywent totheshore ofthisstrange land.
Ku-aha-ilo sawhimcoming, andbreathed out


174LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
thewind ofhishome against theboy. Itwas
likeablack whirlwind rushing tothesea.
Theboywentontoward hisfather's tabu place,
uptoKalewa, intheface ofthestorm. Hesaw

tokillhim.Hebegan hischants andincanta-
tionsandstruck hiswar-club ontheground.
Lavacame outand firewasburning allaround
him.Hecould notstrike the tail,norcould the
tail strike him. Ku-aha-ilo sentmany other
enemies, butthewar-club turned them aside.
The earth wasshaking, ahnost turning upside
down asitwasstruck bythewar-club. Great
openings letlava fires out. Ku-aha-ilo came out
ofhiscave tofight. Hismouth wasopen, his
tongue outstretching, hiseyes glaring, butthe
boywasnotafraid. Hetook hisclub, whirled

body disappeared andcameback inanother form,
asatorrent ofblood. Ke-au-nini thrust itaside.
Then ahandsome man stood before himwith


KE-AU-NINI 175
wild eyes,demanding whohewas. Ku-aha-ilo
hadforgotten hisson,andthemiraculous war-
clubwhich hehadgiven toHiilei, sohebegan to
fight with hishands. Ke-au-nini laid hisclub
down. The father was near theend ofhis
strength, andsaid,"Let ouranger cease, thatwe
mayknow each other. "Theboywasveryangry
andsaid:"You have treated mecruelly, when I
onlycame toseeyouand tolove you.You
would have takenmyyoung lifefor sacrifice.
Nowyou tellmeyoubelong tothetemple ofmy
ancestors inNuu-mea-lani." Then hecaught
hisfather and lifted himup.Hetossed him,
dizzyandworn out,intotheair,andcatching the
body broke itover hisknee. Ku-aha-ilo had
killed andeaten allhispeople, sothatnoonewas
leftinhisland. Theboy's sistersawthebattle
andwentaway toKa-lewa-lani (thedivine far-

Ke-au-nini returned onhisocean journey to

thattheboywasnotdead, buthad killed Ku-

Thebrothers talked about thepower ofKe-au-
niniwhohadkiUed hisfather, amanwithout
parents, partgodandpartman. They thought

hewouldnow killthem. Ke-au-nini became pale
andthinand sick, desiring thewoman ofhis

woman orhewould killthem.
Ke-au-kai toldhimthathewould consult the

Hiilei camedown tostaywith hersonwhile

Ke-au-miki went tohisplace intheboat. The

theyfound aproper girltheywould return; if
not,theywould notcome back. They pushed

Another stroke and landwas out ofsight.
Swiftly leaped theboatovertheocean.
They sawbirds ontheisland Kaula. One
bird flew up.Heavy winds almost upset the
boatand filled itwithwater uptotheir chins.
They caught thepaddles, bailing-cups, andloose

Thewind increased likeacyclone overthem.

Kohala, seeking thedream-land ofKe-au-nini,
andthenaround toWaipio Valley. There they
sawarainbow resting over thehome ofatabu
chief, Ka-lua-hine. They landed near thedoor
oftheUnder- world. Thisentrance isthrough a


KE-AU-NINI 179
caveunder water. There theysawtheshadow
ofMilu, theruler ofthedead. Milu's people
called out,"Here aremenbreaking thetabu of
thechief." Olopana, avery high chief, heard
theshouts while hewas inthetemple inthe
valley. Hesawthevisitors chased bythepeople,
running hereand there. Haina-kolo, hissister,
was tabu. Watchmen were ontheoutside of
herhouse. They alsosawthetwomenandthe
people pursuing, andtoldHaina-kolo, andshe
ordered oneofthewatchmen togooutandsay
tothestrangers, "Oh, runswiftly; run,run,and
come inside thistemple!" They heard andran
in.Thepeople stopped ontheoutside ofthe
wallaround thehouse. Thiswasatabudrum
place, andnotatemple ofsafety.
Olopana was intheheiau (temple) Pakaa-
lana. Haina-kolo askedwhothey were. They
saidthey were from Hawaii. She said,"No,
youhavecome from thesea." Hoo-lei-palaoa,
oneofherwatchmen, called, andmencameand
caught thetwo strangers, taking them toOlo-
pana, whowasvery angry because theyhad
come intothetemple ofhissister. Soheordered
hismen totakethem atonceandcarrythem to
aprison house todieonthemorrow. Hesaid if
theprisoners escaped, thewatchmen should die
and their bodies beburned inthe fire.Toward
morning thetwoprisoners talked together and


l8oLEGENDS OFCODSANDGHOSTS
Uttered incantations. Ke-au-nini sawbythe
signs thattheywere insome trouble andchanted
intheears ofthewatchmen: "They shall not
die.They shallnotdie."
Thewatchmen reported toOlopana what they
hadheard, then returned towatch. Themoon
was rising andthetwoprisoners were talking.
Ke-au-kai told hisbrother tolook atthemoon,
saying: "This means life.The cloud passes,
morning comes." Ka-au-kai prayed and
chanted. Thewatchmen again reported toOlo-
pana, giving thewords ofthechant. Inthis
chant thefamily names were given. Olopana
said:"These arethenames ofmymother's people.
Mymother isHina. Her sister isHiilei. Her
brothers areKe-au-kai andKe-au-miki. They
were allliving atKuai-he-lani. Hina andher
husband Kuwentaway toWaipio. There she
hadherchild, Haina-kolo."
Olopana sentmessengers forHina, whowas
liketherising moon, giving life,and forher
husband Ku,whowasatNapoopoo, asking them
tocomeandlook atthese prisoners. They ran
swiftly andarrived bydaylight. Hinahadbeen
troubled allnight. Messengers called: "Awake!
Listen tothechant oftheprisoners, captured
yesterday." Andthey reported theprayers of
Ke-au-kai. Hina arose andwent totheheiau
(temple) andheard thestory ofherbrothers.


KE-AU-NINI i8i
whocame alsowith the warriors. Olopana
heard Hina wailing with herbrothers, andwas
afraid that hismother would killhimbecause
hehad treated his visitors sobadly. The
strangers toldhertheyhadcome tofindawife
forKe-au-nini. Theyhadlooked atthebeautiful
women ofalltheislands andhadfound none
except thewoman atWaipio. Then they told
about theanger ofthepeople, thepursuit, and
their entrance intothetabu temple.
Hinacommanded Olopana tocome before
them. Hetook warriors and chiefs andcame
over tothetemple andstood before hisparents.
Hinapronounced judgment, saying: "This chief
shall livebecause hesent forme.The chiefsand
people whopursued shall dieandbecooked in
theoven invirhich they thought toplace the
strangers."
Ku's warriors captured Olopana's menand
tookthem away prisoners, butOlopana was
spared andmade welcome byhisuncle. And
they allfeasted together fordays. Then the
brothers prepared togoafter Ke-au-nini.
Onemanwhoheard thewailing ofthebrothers
andknew ofthecomiag ofHina went tohis
house, took hiswifeandchildren andranbyway
ofHilo toPuna-luu. Itwas said thismantook

out. For thistheowlwasinjured byastone
which wasthrown athim,andhetoldtheother
birds. They saidhewas rightly punished for
hisfault.
Thebrothers found theirredboat, launched it,
andbade farewell tothechief's people andlands.
They returned toKuai-he-lani, likeaflash of
lightning speeding along thecoast from south
towest. Theboy inthetemple sawthem in
their swift boat. Hetold Hiilei andprepared
fortheir coming. They landed, feasted, andtold
their story. Then theyprepared fortheir jour-
neytoWaipio. Their boatwaspulled byfish
inplace ofboatmen, andthese disappeared upon
arrival atHawaii. Ke-au-kai went firsttomeet
Olopana, whorandown toseeKe-au-nini and
asked howhecame. Ke-au-nini said,"There
wasnowandering, nomurmuring, nohunger, no
pinched faces."
Then they feasted while overthem thunder
andlightning played andmistcovered thehouse.
Awawasthrown before thespirit ofthethunder
andthey established tabus.
Olopana had trouble with hispriests and
became angry andwanted topunish them be-
cause they didnotknowhow todotheirwork
sowellasKe-au-nini. They couldmake thun-
derandlightnings andearthquakes, butKe-au-
niniblewtoward theeastandsomething likea

manappeared inacloud ofdust; heputhisright
hand inthedustandbegan tomake land. Olo-
pana saw thisandthought itwasdonebythe
kahunas (priests) andsoheforgave them, think-
ingtheyhadmore power than Ke-au-nini.
Later heordered them tobekilled andcooked.
Olopana asked Ke-au-nini, "Which ofthetabu
houses doyouwish totake asyour residence?"
Ke-au-nini replied: "My house isthelightning,
thebloody sky, orthedark cloud hanging over
Kuai-he-lani, down theridge orextending cape
Ke-au-oku, whereKuofKauhika is,where mul-
titudes ofeyesbend lowbefore thegods. The
house ofmyparents—there iswhere Idwell.
Youhaveheard ofthatplace."
Olopana was greatly astonished, bowed his
headandthought foralongtime, then said:"We
willsetapart ourtabudays forworship, and I
willseeyourtabu place—^youinyour placeand
Ioutside. When youarethrough yourdays of
tabuyoumust return andwewilllivetogether."
Ke-au-nini raised hiseyesandspoke softly to
theclouds above hun:"Omyparents, thismy
brother-in-law wishes toseeourdwelling-place,
therefore callKe-au-kai tosenddown ourtabu
dwelling-place."
Ke-au-kai wasnearhim,and said:"Wehad
verymany troubles ontheocean incoming after
theonewhom youwant foryour wife.You


l84 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
aided ustoescape; perhaps theoldman inthe
skies willhearyou ifyou call." Then Ke-au-
niniturned toward theeast:
"Ke-au-nim hashishome,
Hishome with hismother.
Hiilei, thewife,
Shewasthechild o£Nakula-uka,
Thefirst-bom Kakela.
Thecheeks grow red;
Andtheeyes flash fire.
IntheLewa-lani [heavensl,

Let allthecolors ofthetortoise-back

Let alltheposts stand strong;

Fasten inalsothesmoke-colored feathers;
Work swiftly andcomplete ourtabu house.''
Then thedarkness ofevening came, andinthe
shadows thelittle people labored inthemoonless
night. Soon theirwork wasdone, thehouse
finished, andasacred drum placed inside. When
theclearskyofthemorning rested over,andthe
sunmade visible thefairyhome intheearly
dawn, thepeople cried outwithwonder atthe
beautiful thing before them. There stood a
house ofglowing feathers ofallcolors. Posts

andrafters ofpolished bones shone liketheivory
teeth ofthewhale, tinted inthesmoke ofafire.
Softly swayed thefeathered thatch inagentle
breeze, rustUng through thesurrounding cocoa-
trees. Most beautiful itwas, asinthechant of
Lilinoe:
"Hulei Lilinoe meKuka-hua-ula;
HeleHoaheo ikaioMokuleia."
"Lifted up,blown bythewind are
The fallsdown totheseaofMokuleia."
Ke-au-nini told hisbrother-in-law, "Oh,my
brother, lookuponmytabu dwelling-place as
youwished."
Olopana wasvery curious, andasked,"How
many people areneeded tomake ahouse like
thissoquickly?" Ke-au-nini laughed and said,
"You have seenmypeople: there arethree of
uswho built thishouse—I,the chief, andmy
twofriends."
Hedidnotgivethenames ofthe little people,
Kana-mu andKana-wa, whowere really great
multitudes, likethemenehunes whomade the
ditch atWaimea, Kauai. They were theone-
night people. Allthisworkwasfinished while
they alone could seeclearly tousetheirmagic
powers.
Inside thehouse laysoftmatsmade from feath-
ersofmany birds, and sleeping-couches better
thanhad ever been seen before. Ke-au-nini
said tohisbrother-in-law: "We arenowready


l86 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
tohave thetabu ofourhouse.Myparents will
enter withme."
Olopana asked hiskahunas ifitwere right for
theparents tostaywiththechief during atabu,
under thelawoftheir land. The priests con-
sulted andtoldOlopana that thiswas allright.
They hadnopower toforbid. Theparents had
divine power, soalsotheboy,both ahke, and
could dwell together without breaking tabu.
Then they said,"Ifyouforbid, youwillbeland-
less."
Ke-au-kai andKe-au-miki entered thehouse
with theiryoung chief. Ke-au-miki beat the
sacred drum, announcing thetabu. They poured
anddrank awa, atesugar-cane andchanted softly
totherhythm ofthedrum. Olopana was filled
with jealousy because allwashidden from him.
Hedidnotknowwhat adrum was.Hehadonly
known atime oftabu, butnotthesecret drum,
andthesoftchant.
During thetendays' tabu Ke-au-nini didnot
seehiswife,butremained shut inhisplace. Olo-
pana called forallthepeople tobring presents.
When thetabuwasoverandthetemple door
opened, Ke-au-nini andHaina-kolo prepared for
themarriage.
Allthepeople came bringing feather mats,
food, fish,andawa,which hadbeen growing on
atree.Hamakua sentfoodand fish; Hilo sent


KE-AU-NINI 187
olona and feathers; Puna sentmats andawa
from thetrees; Kau sentkapa; Kona sentred
kapas; Kohala sent itswonderful noted sweet
potatoes. Theyoung chiefess appeared before all
thepeople, coming from hertabu place, andshe
saw allthefinepresents, andagreat cocoanut-
leaflanai (porch) prepared byherbrother. She
came there before herparents andbrother. They
were waiting forKe-au-nini, whodelayed com-
ing.Olopana asked hispriests: "Why does the
young chief failtoappear? Weareallready for
themarriage feast. "Thepriest saidtoOlopana:
"Doyouthink thatyoucantreat thisman as
oneofus?'Heisagodonhisfather's sideand
alsoonhismother's. He isvery high. Itis
onhismother's sidethatyouarerelated. You

nut. Ifwedonotdothese things weshall not
know where heisstaying, forheisunder the
care ofthegods.Now istheright time togo
with theoffering. Goquickly. Thesun isris-
inghigh inthesky."
Olopana quickly gathered theofferings and
wentaway tosacrifice before Ke-au-nini. He
called himthus:
"Rise up!Letyour strength look inland;
Letyourmight looktoward thesea;
Letyour facelookupward;

Thestrange night haspassed. Awakel

Hesetthepigfreeand itrantothefeetof
Ke-au-nini. Thechicken didthesame, andthe
other offerings were laidbefore thedoor. Olo-
pana went back. Ke-au-nini and hisuncles
awoke. Hesaid tothem:"Now thetabu is
lifted. Now thehour ofthemarriage hascome.
Wemust prepare togodown tothesea.We
shall seethesports ofthisland. Soonweshall
meet thepriests andthepeople."
They aroseandopened their bundles ofkapa,
very fineand softforredmalos (girdles) forthe
uncles. Ke-au-nini putonhismalo, called
Ke-kea-awe-awe-ula (the redgirdle with long
ends, shaded inthetints oftherambow) and
hisredfeather cloakand hisredfeather helmet,
nodding likeabird. His skin, polished and
perfimied, shone resplendently. Hewasmost
gorgeous inhisappearance.
When hewent outofhishouse, thatched with
bird feathers andbuilt ofpolished bones, dark-
ness spread over thesky.The voices ofthe
little fairies, theKana-mu andKana-wa were
heard. Thepeople inthegreat cocoanut lanai
were filled withwonder, fortheyhadnever seen
darkness come inthisway. Itwas likethesun
eclipsed. When Ke-au-nini andhiscompanions


AYOUNG CHIEF OFHAWAII




KE-AU-NINI 189
entered thelanai, thedarkness passed awayand
allthepeople sawthem intheir splendor. The
chiefs opened away forthethree. Ke-au-miki
came infirstandthepeople thought hewasthe
husband, butwhen Ke-au-kai came they said,
"This one ismore beautiful," andwhen Ke-au-
ninipassed before them they fellontheir faces,
although hehadagauze kapa thrown overhim.
Hepassed onbetween rows ofchiefs tothe
place ofmarriage. Hisuncles stepped aside, and
thenhethrew offhisthinkapaandthepeople
shouted again andagain until theechoes shook
theprecipices around thevalley.
Then Haina-kolo came outofherhouse near
byandwasguided totheside ofherhusband.
Asshesawhimherheart melted andflowed to
him likethemingling offloating sea-mosses.
Olopana arose and said:"0chiefs andpeople,
Ihavebeenasked tocome here tothemarriage
ofmysister withonewhom shehasmetindreams
andloved. Iagree tothiswedding. Ourpar-
entsapprove, andthegodshave given their signs.
Our chiefess shall belong tothestranger. You
shall obey him. Iwilldoashemay direct.
They shallnowbecome husband andwife."
Thepeople shouted again andagain, saying,
"This isthehusband ofour chiefess." Then
began thehookupu. Sixdistricts brought six
piles ofofferings. There were treasures and


190LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
treasures ofallkinds. Then came thewonder-
fulfeast ofallthepeople.
The fishcompanions ofKe-au-nini, whohad
drawn hisboatfrom Kuai-he-lani, wanted Haina-
kolo forthemselves. While theywere atthe
feasttheyfound theycould notgether,andthey
grew coldandashamed andangry. Soon they
broke away from thefeast. MoiandUhuran
away totheseaandreturned totheir homes.
Niu-loa-hiki (agreat eel)looked atKe-au-nini
and said:"You arevery strange. Ithought
Ishould havemyreward thisday,butthewin-
ninghascome toyou. Iamangry, because you
aremyservant. Itisashame forthechiefs of
Hawaii toletyoubecome their ruler." His
angry eyesflashed fire,heopened hismouth and
started tocryoutagain, butthepeople sawhim
andshouted: "Look, look, there isaneelthat
comes totheland.Herunsanddives intothe
sea. This eel,Niu-loa-hiki, ismore evilthan
anyother ofallthefamily ofeels."
Then allthe fishran offangry atthis failure
andgathered intheseaforconsultation. Uhu
saidhewould return atonce toMakapuu. He
wastheUhuwhohadthegreat battle with
Kawelo when hewascaught inanet.Moiwent

came tovisitHawaii. HewaskilledbyLimaloa.
HouandAwela went wherever they could find
aditch toswim in.
Thepeople feasted onthemullet ofLolakea
andthebaked dogs ofHiloandthehumpbacked
mullet ofWaiakea and allthesweet things of
Hawaii. Then thesports commenced andthere
wassurf-riding, dancing, wrestling, andboxing.
Kawelo-hea, thesurf-rider ofKawa inOahu,
wasthebest surf-rider. Hina-kahua, thechild
ofthebattling-places ofKohala, wasthebest
boxer. Pilau-hulu, thenoted boy ofOlaa, was
thebest puhenehene-player. Lilinoe wasthe
bestkonane-player. Luu-kia wasthebest kilu-
player. Shewasarelative ofHaina-kolo.
When thesports were over they returned to
thechief's house and slept. Haina-kolo wasone
whodidnotclosely adhere tothetabu. Sheate
thetabu things, which were sacred, belonging to
thegods, such asbananas andluau. Ke-au-nini
hadalways carefully, from hisbirth tomarriage-
day,observed thetabu, but,following theexam-
pleofhiswife,soon laidaside hiscarefulness, and
lived infulldisregard ofallrestraint foratime.
Then Ke-au-nini leftHaina-kolo andreturned
toKuai-he-lani because dissensions arose be-
tween themonaccount oftheir wrong-doing.
Hedidnot tellhiswifeorfriends, oreven his
uncles, buthetook hiscocoanut-boat togoback


192LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
tohishome secretly. When hewas faroutin
theocean hissister sawhimfrom herhome in
Lewa-lani (theblue sky). ShesentKana-ula,
herwatchman, togooutandguard himandbring
himtoher. Kana-ula wasastrong windblowing
with theblack clouds which risebefore astorm.
Inalittle while thewatchman sawKe-au-nini
offKohala, andbyhisgreat strength lifted Ke-
au-nini andplaced himonKuai-he-lani, where he
sawhismother and relatives. Then hewentup
toLewa-lani tohissister anddwelt with herto
forget hislove forHaina-kolo.
Haina-kolo hadagreat love forherhusband,
never making anytrouble before they separated.
Herlove forhimwasburning and fullofpassion,
while shegrieved over hisdisappearance. She
soonhadachild. Thepriests living intheheiau
(temple), Pakaalana, beat their drums, and all
Waipio knew thatachiefwasborn.
Haina-kolo began togoabout likeonecrazed,
longing toseetheeyes ofherhusband. Shetook
herchildandlaunched outintheocean. The
boat inwhich sheplaced thechildwasthelong
husk ofacocoanut. Sheheld fasttothisand
swam andfloated byitsside.When theyhad
gone faroutintheseaagreat wind swept over
themandupon them, driving them faroutof
sight ofallland. Shelooked only fordeath.
ThiswindwasKana-ula, andhadbeen sentby


KE-AU-NINI 193
Moho, whowasveryangry atthe girlforvio-
lating thetabu ofthegodsandeating thethings
setapart forthegods. Thiswindwastoblow
herfaraway ontheocean untildeath came.
When Haina-kolo hadbeenblown alittleway
sheprayed andmoved her feet, turning toward
theplace where shehadrejoiced with herhus-
band. Then sheoffered another prayer and
began toswim, butwasdriven outofsight of
land. Thewind ceased, itsanger passed away,
andanewland appeared. Sheswam toward
thisnew land. Lei-makani, thechild, saw this
land, which wasthehigh place ofKe-ao-lewa,
andchanted:
"Destroy thefirstkougrove;
Destroy thesecond kougrove;
Open awonderful door intheevening;
OfEeryour worship.
Return, return,Obird!"
Themother said:"No,mychild, that isnota
bird. Oh,my child, that isKe-ao-lewa, the
landwhere weshall findashore."
Butshewent onpatiently, swimming bythe
capes ofKohala, andcame near totheplaces of
noted surfandwasalmost ontheland. Moho
sawher stillswimming andsentanother wind-
servant, Makani-kona, thesouth wind, todrive
heragain outintheocean. This south wind
came likeawhirlwind, sweeping and twisting
over thewaves, sending Haina-kolo faroutin


194LEGENDS OFCODSANDGHOSTS
thetossing sea.Hethought hehad killed her,
sohewentback toMoho.
Moho asked himabout hisjourney over the
seas.Hereplied, "You sentmetokill,andthat
Idid." Shewas satisfied andceased hervigi-
lance. Tired and suffering, Haina-kolo andher
child floated faroutintheocean, tooweary to
swim. Then Lei-makani sawKe-ao-lewa again
liftedupandspread outlikethewings ofafloat-
ingbird. Helpcame toherinagreat shark,
Kau-naha-ili-pakapaka (Kau-naha, witharough
skin), belonging tothefamily ofPii-moi, oneof
therelatives ofKu,whoswam uptoherand
carried herandthechild until hewas tired.
Haina-kolo wasrested andwarmed bythesun.
Shesawthathershark friend wasgrowing weak,
soshecalled tothesun,"Osun,goonyourway
totheland ofKa-lewa-nuu, and tellKe-au-nini
thatwearehere atthecape ofKa-ia."
Thesundidnothear thecryfrom the sea.
Shecalled again, using thesame words. Thesun
heard this callofHaina-kolo andwentontothe
place where Ke-au-nini wasstaying and called
tohim,"0Ke-au-nini, your wife isnear the
cape ofKa-ia."
Moho heard the call. Shewasplaying konane
with herbrother. Shemade anoise toconfuse
thewords ofthesun,and said toherbrother,
"0kekukela, okaholo keia. Niole kaluna.


KE-AU-NINI 195
kopala kaele,nakekeakaai.""Take thisone
up.Letthatonemove. Take thatupslowly.
Theblack isblotted out,thewhite wins."
Then thesuncalled again, saying thesame
words, andKe-au-nini heard, leaped upand left
hissister, andwentdown toKuai-he-lani and
entered thetemple, where hewasaccustomed to
sleep, and fellasonedead. While hewas reclin-
ing, hisspirit lefthisbodyandwentdown to
Miluandstayed there along time.
Haina-kolo wasvery near theland inthe
afternoon. Soontheycame tothebeach. There
shedugalittle hole forherchildandlaidhimin

crazy person tothetopofthehigh precipices of
Ka-hula-anu (the cold dancing) andbegan to

selfinleaves, thenrushed intotheforest.
Lei-makani was stillfloating where hismother
had lefthim,nearaplace where theservants of
Luu-kia went fishing every morning togetthe
food loved bythe chiefs. Twomen, Ka-holo-
holo-uka andKa-holo-holo-kai, hadcomedown
forLuu-kia, carrying anet.They threw their
netover thewater andthechild floated into it.
They thought theyhad agreat fish.They
carried thenetuponthebeach andfound the
boy. Itwasalittle dark,andhard toseewhat
theywere catching. One called totheother,


196LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
"What havewecaught thismorning?" The
other said:"Ithought wehadagreat fish,but
this isachild. Iwilltake this child tomy
home." Theother said,"No— This isafish."
Sotheyhadaquarrel until thesunrose. Then
theywentuptothevillage.
Ka-holo-holo-uka told hiswife,"We have- a
child." Then hetoldherhowtheyhadcaught
Lei-makani. They talked loudly. This chiefess
heard their noisy clamor andasked herservant,
"What's thetrouble with these noisy ones?"
They toldherandshewanted that childbrought
toher,andcommanded Maile-lau-lii (small leaf
maile) togoandget it.Hetook ittoLuu-kia,
whomarked itswonderful beauty. She sent
forthefishermen totellherhowthey gotthe,
child. They toldherabout thefishing.
Shewanted toknowwhowere theparents.
They said:"Wedonotknow. Thismaybethe
child ofHaina-kolo, forweknow shehas dis-
appeared withherchild. Shemaybedeadand
thismaybeherboy."
Luu-kia said,"You twotake thechild, and I
will give thename, Lopa-iki-hele-wale [going
without anything]. Then youcare for ituntil
itgrows up."
They took thechild totheland ofOpaeloa, as
agood place tobring itup.Thefishermen said
toLuu-kia, "Will youprovide food, fish,and


KE-AU-Nim 197
cldthing?" Shesaid,"Yes." They thought the
childwould notunderstand, but itknew allthese
words. The fisherman and hiswifetook the
child away. Waipio Valley people were sur-
rounded byprecipices, butthegods ofWaipio
watched allthetroubles bysending messengers
togoover totheupland and follow Haina-
kolo.
KuandHinaandOlopana wereburdened by
thelossofHaina-kolo andLei-makani, sothey
went tothetemple atPakaalana, where the
uncles ofKe-au-nini were staying. There they
consulted thegodswith signsandsorceries.
They sent Ke-au-miki togetsome little
stones atKea-au, aplace nearHaena. His
brother said:"Get thirteen stones—seven white
and sixblack. Make them fastinabundle, so
theycannot belost,thencomebackbyPana-ewa
andgetawa {piper methysticum) which man
didnotplant, butwhich wascarried bythebirds
tothe treesandplanted there. Then return

au-miki wentupthepali (precipice) andhast-
ened along thetoprunning and leaping and
flying overHamakua toHilo.
TheHilo palis were nothing tothisman as
hesped swiftly over thegulches until hecame
totheWailuku River guarded bythekupua
Pili-a-mo-o, whoconcealed thepath sothatnone

Then Ke-au-miki rushed over theriverandup

turned toward theseaandwent toHaena, to

Then hechanted:
"OKuandKaneandKanaloa,

Tabu islifted from
Mybird-catching place forfood.

Letthefriend betaken care of.

Thebubbles stood ontheright side,andthe
priest said,"We shall never findHaina-kolo;
thegodshave gone away." Olopana said:"I
ammuch troubled formybrother and sister, and
that child Iwanted forthechief ofthisland. I


200LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
donotunderstand why these things havecome
tous."
Allthepeople were silent, weeping softly, but
Ke-au-kai and hisbrother werenottroubled, for
theyknew their chiefandwifewere inthecare
oftheaumakuas.
When Lei-makani hadgrown up,Luu-kia took
himasherhusband. Hewent surf-riding daily.
Shewasvery jealous ofMaile, whowould often
gosurf-riding with him. Lei-makani didnot
care forher, forheknew shewasasister ofhis
mother although shehadachildbyhim. One
day,when hewent with Maile, Luu-kia was
angry andcaught that child and killed itby
dashing itagainst astone.
Theservants wentdown tothebeach, waiting
forLei-makani tocome toland. Then they told
himabout thedeath ofhischildand their fear
forhim ifhewentuptothehouse with Maile.
Lei-makani lefthissurf-board andwent tothe
house weeping, andfound thechild's bodyby
thestone. Hetookapiece ofkapaandwrapped
itup,carrying thebroken bodydown toafoun-
tain,where hecleansed itandoffered chants and
incantations until thechildbecame alive. His
mother, Haina-kolo, heard thefollowing chants
andcame toherson,forthevoicewascarried to
herbykupuas whohadmagic powers. The
child's namewasLono-kai. Hewrapped itagain


KE-Au-mm 201
insoftwarm kapas andchanted while hewashed
thechild, naming thefountain Kama-ahala (a
child haspassed away):
"Kama-ahala smells oftheblood;
The sicksmell oftheblood rises.
Washed away intheearth istheblood;
Hard istheredblood
Warmed bytheheat oftheheavens,
I^doutunder theshining sky.
Lono-kai-o-lohia isdead."
Then thevoice ofthechildwasheard inalow
moan from thebundle, saying,'
'Lono-kai-o-
lohia [Lono possessed oftheAla spirit] isalive."
The father heard thevoice and softly uttered
another chant:
"Inthesilence
Hasbeenheard thegods ofthenight;
What isthiswailing overus?
Wailing forthedeath of
Lono, thespirit ofthesea—dead!"
Thevoicecame again from thekapas,'
'Lono,
the spirit ofthe sea, isalive." Lei-makani's
love forhischildwasoverflowing, andagain he
uttered anincantation tohisownparents:
"OKu,thefather!
Hina, themother!
Olopana wasthefirst-bom;
Haina-kolo, thesister, wasbom;
Haina-kolo andKe-au-nini were theparents:
Lei-makani wasthechild:
1amLei-makani, thechild ofHaina-kolo,
Thesacred woman ofWaipio's precipices;
Mymother islivingamong theripehalas;

Foruswasthefruit o{the ulii;
Iwasfound bythefisherman;
Iamthechild ofthepalihula-anu;
Iwascared forbyoneofmyfamily
Inland atOpaeloa;
They gavemethename Lopa-iki-hele-wale
[Little lazyfellow having nothing];
ButIamLei-makani —^youshallhear it."
Hisheart washeavy with longing forhis
mother, and thegods ofthewind, thewind
brothers, took hisplaintive love-chant tothe
ears ofHaina-kolo, whohadwandered inher
insanity, butwasnow freefrom hercraze and
hadbecome herself. Shefollowed that voice
over theprecipices andvalleys tothetopofa
precipice. Standing thereandlooking down she
sawherchild andgrandchild below, and she
chanted:
"Thy voice Ihaveheard
Softly echoed bythepali,
Wailmg against thepall;
Thy voice,mychild beloved;
Mychild, indeed;
Mychild,when thecloud hxmg over
Andtherainbow lightwasabove us.

When theseawasbreaking myheart;
Mychild ofthecape ofKa-ia,
When thesunwashanging above us.
Where have Ibeen?
TellKe-au-nini~ula-o-ka-lani;
Iwasinthemidst ofthesea
With thechild ofourlove;
Mychild,my little child,
Where areyou? Oh,come back!"


KE-AU-NINI 203
Then shewentdown theprecipice andmet
hersonholding hischild inhisarms, andwailed:
*'Mylordfrom thefogs oftheinland,
From theprecipices fighting thewind,
Striking down along theridges;
Mychild, with thevoice ofabird.
Echoed bytheprecipice ofPakohi,
Shaking anddancing oninaccessible places.
Laughing outonthebroken waters
Where wewere floating indanger;
There Iloved dearly your voice
Fighting withwaves
While thefierce storm wasabove us
Seenbyyourmany gods
Who dwell intheshining sky—
Auwe forusboth!"
They waited alittle while, until thetimewhen
Lono-kai became strong again. Then theywent
uptothevillage.
Haina-kolo hadruninto theforest, herwet
pa-u torn oflf,noclothing left.Herlong hair
washercloak, clothing herfromhead tofoot.
Shewandered until cold, then dressed herself
with leaves. Asherright senses returned she
madewarm garments ofleaves andatefruits of
theforest. When theycame tothevillage they
met thepeople whoknew Haina-kolo. She
dwelt there until Lono-kai grew up.Heand
hisfather looked liketwins, having great resem-
blance, people toldthem, toKe-au-nini. Theboy
asked, "Where ismygrandfather, Ke-au-nini?"
Lei-makani said:"Inever sawyour grandfather.
Hewasverytabuandsacred. Hekilled hisown


204LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
father, Ku-aha-ilo, godoftheheavens. Iknow
bymymana [spirit power] thatheiswith the
daughters ofMilu." Theboysaid:"Imust go
andfindhim. Iwillgoinmyspirit body, leav-
ingthishuman body. Youmust notforbid the
journey." Ke-au-kai, thepriest, said:"You can-
notfindhimunless youlearnwhat todobefore
yougo.Those chiefs ofMiluhavemany sports
andgames. Itellyou these things must be
learned before yougointo that land. Ifyou
areable towinagainst thespirits ofthat place
youcangetyour grandfather."
Allthechiefs aided theboytoacquire skill in
allsports. Theywent tothefields ofPaaohau.
Nuanua, themost skilful teacher ofhula, taught
him todance. Thehighest chiefs andchiefesses
went withhimtohelp, taking their retinues with
them. Lei-makani said:"The knowledge of
sports isthemeans bywhich you willcatch your
grandfather. Nowbecareful. Donotbestingy
with food. Give toothers andtake care ofthe
people."
Theywentupinagreatcompany, andHaina-
kolowondered atthebeauty oftheboy,andasked
whytheywere travelling. Lono-kai toldthem
thereason forhisjourney anddesire toseethe
field ofsports.
Nuanua, thehula teacher, sent hisassistants
toget allkinds ofleaves andflowers used inthe


KE-AU-NINI20S
hula, then sent forablack pigtobeused as
anomen. IfitrantoLono-kai, hewould be-
come agood dancer; ifnot,hewould fail.The
pigwent tohim. Thepriest offered thisprayer:
"Laka isliving where theforest leaves aretrembling,
Theghost -god ofdancers above andbelow,
From theboundary oftheNorth totheplacemost southern:
OLaka, your altar iscovered with leaves.
Thedancing leaves oftheieievine;
This offering ofleaves isthelabor ofthegods.
Thegods ofyour family, PeleandHiiaka;
Thewomen living inwarm winds come here forthe toil,
And thislabor ofours islearning your dance.
Tabu laiddown; tabu lifted. Amama uanoa[wearethroughjl"
The priest lifted hiseyes,andthepigwasseen
lying atthefootoftheboy. Then hecommenced
teaching theboythekiluand the.vfirst dance.
They were thirty days learning thedances, and
theboylearned allthose histeachers knew.
Then theywentaround Hawaii, studying the
dances. Hewastoldtogobackandgetallthe
newideasandseekthegods tolearn theirnewest
dance, fortheirs differed from those ofhisteach-
ers.Hewastoseek thisknowledge indreams.
Lei-makani said:"Your teachers have shown
youtheslowway; ifthat isallyouknow, you
willwinfame, butnotvictory. Youmust learn
from thegods." Lono-kai againwent toHama-
kuawith hiscompanions andlearned howtoplay
konane, thefavorite game ofKe-au-nini. The
teacher said,"Ihave taught you allIknow


2o6 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
inside and outside, asIwould notteach the
other young chiefs." Theboy said tohim,
"There isonething more,—give offerings tothe
gods that theymay teach usinourdreams
newer andbetter ways."
Sotheywaited quietly, offering sacrifices. The
priests toldhimtosetapart apigwhile hemade
aprayer. Ifthepigdiedduring theprayer, he
would notforget anything learned. Theboy
laidhisrighthandonthepigandbegan topray:
"Here isapig,anoffering tothegods.

Then theboylifted hishandandthepiglaysilent

KE-AU-NINI 207
ows ofthethousands ofgods ofKe-au-nini fell
upon theboy. Theteachers andfriends satin
perfect silence foralong time. Thestorm was
beating outside, andtheboywasovercome with
weariness andwondered atthesilence ofhis
friends.
Rainbow colors wereabout him,andthepeople
wereawedbytheir fearsandsat stilluntil even-
ingcame. Then theteacher asked theboy if
hesawwhathadbeendone inthedarkness rest-
ingoverhim,and ifhecould explain tothem.
Theboysaid,"Idonotunderstand you;perhaps
myteacher canexplain."
Nuanua said:"Iamgrowing oldandhave
never seensuch things above anyonelearning
thedance. Youhavecome tomemodestly, like
oneofthecommon people, when Ishould have
gone toyou,andnowthegodsshow yourworth
andpower andtheir favor."
Then hetook apiece ofwood from thehula
altarwhich wascovered with leaves andflowers,
and,putting itinacupofawa,shook it,and
looked, andsaid totheboy:"This isthebest I
candoforyou.Now thegods willtakeyouin

passing them toallthepeople ashechanted
incantations, allthecompany clapping their
hands. Then they drank. Buttheboy's cup
wasdrunk bytheeepas ofPo(gnomes ofthe

night). Sothecompany feasted andthenight
became cahn. Lono-kai that night left his
friends withNuanua andjourneyed on.He
waited some daysandthen toldLei-makani he
thought hewasready. Hesaid: "Yes, Ihave
heard about your success, butIwill seewhat
youcando.We willwait another tendays
before yougo."Then fortwodays allthepeople
ofWaipio brought their offerings. They built
agreat lanai, and feated. Lei-makani told the
people thathehadcalled them together tosee
thewonderful power inthesports oftheboy.
Sotheboystoodupandchanted:
"OKuamu-amu [the little people oftheclouds ofthesky].
The aliithronging incrowds from Kuai-he-lani,
Ontheshoulders ofMoana-liha, divided atthewaters,
Divided atthewaters oftheheavy mist,
Andtheraincoming from theskies.
Andthestorm rushing inland.
Broken intomists arethefalls ofthemountains,—
Mists thatbathe thebuds oftheflowers, ^
Opening thebudsbelow theprecipices.
Arise,Obeloved one!"
Ke-au-nini heard thischant, evendown inPo,
while hewassporting with theeepas ofMilu,
while hisspirit bodywaswith hisfriend Popo-
alaea. Heirepeated thesame chant, and the
ghosts allrejoiced andlaughed, andLaka leaped
tohissideanddanced before him. They had
thesame sports asthenoted onesonHawaii.
Lono-kai danced inmagic power before allthe






KE-AU-Nim 209
people until thetimecame forJiim togoalong
thepath ofhisvisions ofthenight. Allomens
andsignshadbeennoted andwerefound tobe
favorable. Oneoftheoldpriests toldthepeople
tomake known their thought about thebest
path fortheyoung chief, buttheywere silent.
Then Moli-lele, anoldpriestwhohadthespirit
oftheunihipilis resting upon him, said:"Iknow
that there willbemany troubles. Cold and
fierce winds come over thesea.Low tidescome
inthemorning. Theland ofKane-huna-moku
rises inthecoral surf." Hechanted:
"Dead isthischief ofours,
Caught asabird strikes afish;
Thefoam ofsurfwaves risesup,
Smiting anddriving below.
Nosorcerer oftheland isthere.
Where thecoral reeflabors,
Andtherock-eating Hina ofthefar-oS sea."
The chiefs began towail,butlightning was in
theeyes oftheboyand hisfacewas filled with
anger atthisword oftheold priest. Then
another priest arose and said:"0chiefs and
people, Ihave seenthepath totheUnder-world,
and itisnotright forthisyoungman togo.His
body ishiunan andeasily captured bytheghosts.
Hemight besafe ifhecould getthebody ofthe

210LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
Then Kalei, another priest, said:"Iknow their
world. Isawthestars thismorning, andthey
toldmethatthepathwasstopped against this
chiefbybroken coralandthebones ofthedead.
Thetabu-children ofHina areswimming inthe
sea. Iwillprove thedanger bythisawa cup.
Ifthebubbles oftheawapoured ingotothe
right, hecango. Iftothe left,hemust stay."
This hediduttering incantations, butbubbles
covered allthesurface.
Then thepriests advised theyoung chief to
stayandeatthefatoftheland. Then Hae-hae,
thegreat chief, said,"Wehavecome topoint out
apath, ifwecan,andtomake quietandpeaceful
thatway intoPo."Heinstituted newomens,
andshowed thattheyoung chiefwould besuc-
cessful, buthewould havemany difficulties to
overcome.
Lono-kai aroseandsaid:"The words ofthese
chiefs were twisted. Iwillgoafter the spirit-
body ofmygrandfather, asIhavesworn todo.
Myword isfast. Iwillgotothelandwheremy
grandfather stays."
The priests whohad tried toterrify Lono-kai
were hisenemies, andwould oppose hisjourney,
andhewanted them killed, butLei-makani would
notpermit it.Kualsoquieted himwith patient
words, andheceased from anger andtoldthem
hemust prepare atonce togo.


KE-AU-NINI 211
Lei-makani hadadouble canoemade ready,
andselected anumber ofstrong men toaccom-
pany theyoung chief. Lono-kai would nothave
anyofthesemen,butwent outearly inthemorn-
ing,tookacupofawa tothetemple nearby and
chanted hisgenealogical mele.
Thunder andlightning andheavy wind and
rainattended hisvisit tothetemple. Here-
turned tohisparents andtoldthem towait for
himthirty days. Ifamistwasover alltheland
theymight waitandwatch tendaysmore, and
ifthemistcontinued, another ten,when hewould
return with thunder andlightning tomeet his
friends. But ifthevoices oftheseawere strong
atKumukahi, with mist resting onOpaelolo
and rainonPuu-o-ka-polei, then hewould be
dead.
Hetook hisfeather cloak andwarweapons
from hisgrandparents, andfeather helmet, and
went out.Hebade hisparents farewell, took a
cocoanut-husk canoe andwentdown tothesea.
Thewaves rose high, pounding theface ofthe
coast precipices. Lei-makani randown tobring
Lono-kai back, butaccording totheproverb he
caught thehand ofthechiefess who lives inthe
land ofNowhere. Theboyhaddisappeared.
Out intheseaLono-kai was tossing inthe
highwaves, passing alltheislands, even tothe
landNiihau. There hemetthegreatwatchman


212LEGENDS OFGOGSANDGBOSTS
ofKuai-he-lani called Honu (the turtle). He
came quietly near thehead. Honu asked,
"Where areyougoing?" Lono-kai said:"You
speak asifyoualone hadtheright tothesea.
You areahumpbacked turtle; youshallbecome
agreat round stone." Then theturtle began
toslap itsfinsonthesea,raising waves high as
precipices. Five times forty hestruck thesea
withmighty force, looking forthedestruction of
thechief asthewaves passed over him. But
Lono-kai waited until theturtle became tired,
thinking thechief dead. Asthewaters became
calm thechief raised hiscluband struck the
right flapper oftheturtle, destroying itspower.
Then the left finbeat theseaintofoam, but
Lono-kai waited andbroke that finalso ;thenhe
broke theback oftheturtle into little pieces and
went onhisway. Soon theocean grew fierce
again. Huge waves came, andwhirlwinds. He
sawsomething redinthegreat sea—akupua
oftheocean. Thename ofthisenemy wasEa,
agreat redturtle, whocrawled outandasked
where hewas going. Lono-kai said:"What
right haveyou toquestion me?Have Iques-
tioned your right togoonthesea?"
Easaid:"This isnotyour place. Iwill kill
you.You shallbefood formetoeat.When
youaredead Iwillgoand killthewatchman who
letyoucome into thistabu-sea ofmychief."


KE-AV-NINI 213
"Who isyour chief?" asked Lono-kai. Eare-
plied :''Hina-kekai [thecalabash forboiling water],
thedaughter ofPii-moi. Now Iwill killyou."
ThenEabegan tostrike thewater with his
right fin,throwing thewater uponallsides in
mighty waves, expecting tooverthrow Lono-kai
andhisboat. When herested toseetheresult
ofthisbattle hisfinwasonthesurface, andthe
chief struck itandbroke it.
Then inanother fight,whenheadand finwere
lifted todestroy theboat, Lono-kai struck the
neckandbroke it,sokilling hisenemy.
Nowhethought allhistroubles wereoverand
hecould gosafely onhisway.
Butsoon there laybefore himanewenemy,
floating onthesea,avery long thing, likealong

butLono-kai, leaping uponthehead oftheeel,

breaking thebones. Firecame outofthebroken
head, the eelfalling into pieces which became
islands offireinthemidst ofwhich appeared a
very beautiful woman whoasked himwhence he
came, andwhy.
HetoldherhewasfromHawaii andwasgoing
toKuai-he-lani andwould killher,forhethought
shewasamo-o, ordragon-woman. Hesaid,
"You tried tokillme, woman, andnow
youmust stayandbecome the fireoven ofthe
ocean." Heasked hername. Shesaid tohim:
"This kupua wasWaka, thedragon oftherough
head,andIhave escaped from hisbody. Iwant
younow formyhusband, andIwillaccompany

Lono-kai told her,"This would notberight,
butwhen Ireturn, ifIcome thisway,you shall
bemine." Shesaid,"My ruler will killme,for
Ihavebeen senttoguard thisplace." Lono-kai
asked,"Who isyour ruler?" "Hina-kekai, she
will killme.Youbelong totheKu-aha-ilo fam-
ily,which isavery strong family. Therefore we
havebeenwatching foryouforourchiefess."
Lono-kai toldhertogotohislandandwait
forhim.Hewould beherhusband. Shemust
wait there without fault until hisreturn. Then
hewent away. Waka didnotknow whence this
chief came, soshewent toOahu andlanded at
Laiewai. There sheawaited herhusband.


KE-AU-NINI 215
Lono-kai went ontotheland ofKuai-he-lani,
where helanded andhidhisboatamong the
vinesonthebeach. Hewent tothetemple where
thebody ofhisgrandfather lay,cleanandbeau-
tiful indeath. Hecould notseeanydoor or
break inthebody fortheescape ofthespirit.
Then hestruck theearth with hismagic war-
club until agreat holeopened. Helooked down
andsawalarge house andmany people moving
around below. Heknew that thespirit ofhis
grandfather was there. Hewent down and
looked about, butthepeople haddisappeared.
Theremains ofagreat feast were there. He
stood atthedoor looking in,when twomenap-
peared andwelcomed himwithan"Aloha," and
toldhimhemusthavecomefrom thelandabove,
forthere wasnoman likehim inthat place.
They advised him tomake hispathback into
thatlandfromwhence hehadcome, for ifthe
king oftheUnder-world sawhimhewould be
killed. Lono-kai asked,"Who isyour king?"
They toldhim,"Milu." "What doeshedo?"
"Our king dances forPopo-alaea andKe-au-
nini." Lono-kai went with themen toseethe
sports. They tried topersuade himnottogo,
buthewasvery obstinate andasked them to
hidehim. They said, "Ifwedothisandyou
arediscovered weshallbedestroyed."
Hetoldthem thereason ofhiscoming and


2i6LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
asked their help,andsaidwhen hehadhisgrand-
father they could follow him into theUpper-
world. They went toahouse which waslarge
andbeautiful. They entered andsawthechiefs
playing kilu. After alongtimeLono-kai began
tomake hispresence known. Popo-alaea was
winning. Then Ke-au-nini chanted:
"The multitude ofthose below givegreeting
Tothefriends oftheinland forest ofPuna;'
Wepraise therestfulness ofourhome;
Theleaves anddivine flowers ofthatplace."
Lono-kai chanted thesame words asanecho
ofKe-au-nini. Silence fellonthegroup, and
Milu cried out:"Who isthedisturber ofour
sport? Wemust findhimand killhim." They
began thesearch, butcould notfindanyone
and atlastresumed their games. Popo-alaea
chanted:
"Iwelcome bademyfriend.
Thegreatshadow ofWaimea,
Where stands themilo-tree inthegentle breeze,
Andtheohia-tree. Youknow theplace."
Ke-au-nini sang thesame chant. Then Lono-
kaiechoed itvery softly andsweetly. Allsaid
this lastvoicewasthebest. Milu again caused
asearch tobemade, butfound nothing. The
twomenhidLono-kai byapost ofthehouse.
Thegroup returned tothesports. SoonMilu
changed thegame tohula. Ke-au-nini stood up
todance andbegan hischant:


KE-AV-NINI 217
*'Aloha toourhouses without friends.
Thepath goesinland toFapalakamo;
Comenowandenter!
Outside isthetrouble, thestonn,
Andthereyoumeet thecold."
Thepeople around were striking the spirit
drums. Then Lono-kai chanted:
"Established isthehonor ofKe-au-nini
(Noteworthy isthename).
Lifted uptothehighheaven;
Iamthechild ofLei-makani,
IamLono from thesunrise place, Hae-o-hae:
Ihavecome after thee,myfather;
Wemust return. Where areyou?"
Ke-au-nini could notstand uptodance when
heheard thevoice ofhisgrandchild, forhislove
overpowered him.Helooked upandsawthe
form oftheyoung chief leaping intotheplace
prepared forthehulaandstanding there before
thechief. Thepeople roseupingreat confu-
sion. Lono-kai caught thespirit ofKe-au-nini
andput itinacocoanut-shell. Heleaped past
theghosts, andranvery swiftly outofthehouse.
Some ofthepeople sawhim layhands on
Ke-au-nini, andcried out:"Oh, thehusband of
ourchiefess! Oh,thehusband ofourchiefess!
Hehastaken thehusband ofourchiefess!"But
theydidnotseeLono-kai goout.Thetwomen
whohadaided Lono-kai went outassoon ashe
leaped intothehula place. They hurried along
thepath toward freedom, butLono-kai soon


2l8LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
overtook them. Milu called tohispeople to
hasten andcapture and killtheonewhohad
stolen Ke-au-nini. They sawthetwomenwith
Lono-kai, andpursued rapidly, butcould not
overtake them. The fugitives were very near
theopening totheworld above. When Lono-
kaisaw that thepursuers were almost upon
himhewhirled hismagic war-club and struck
theground, making agreat hole intowhich the
spirits felloneovertheother.
Lono-kai andthetwowatchmen wentupthe
caveopening bywhich hehadgonedown into
theland ofMilu. Dawn wasbreaking asthey
raninto thetemple atKuai-he-lani, where the
body ofKe-au-nini waslying. Lono-kai pushed
thespirit intothehollow ofthefootandheldthe
foot fast,shaking ituntil thespirit hadgone to
theveryends ofthebodyand lifehadreturned.
When Ke-au-nini was fully restored, Lono-kai
askedhim ifhecould help restore totheir bodies
thetwo spirits whohadaided him inescaping.
Ke-au-nini evidently didnotremember anything
ofhislifeintheUnder-world, forhedidnotknow
these ghosts andthought hehadbeen asleep
from thetimeheentered thetemple and fell
down inweariness. Lono-kai thought they
could notfindthebodies, butKe-au-nini put
theghosts incocoanuts and carried them up
intotheforest tooneofhisancestors whoknew


KE-AU-Nim 219
thebodies from which these ghosts hadcome.
Thus ,they were restored andhadalongand
happy lifeintheir former home.
Lono-kai toldhisgrandfather theymust return
toHawaii tomeet allthefriends.
Forthirty daysmists covered Hawaii andthere
wasthunder and lightning and earthquakes.
Then Lono-kai saidtoKe-au-nini: "To-morrow
wemust gotoHawaii. Wemust have theap-
propriate ceremonies forcleansing andtaking
food." Ke-au-nini said: "Yes, Ihave been a
longtime intheadopted land ofMilu, andmy
eyes aredimmed andmythought isdazed with
thedance oftherestless spirits ofthenight.We
must wait until Ihaveperformed allthecleans-
ingceremonies, made offerings andincantations.
Prayers must besaidformyreturn tolife.Then
wewillgo."
They attended toallthetemple rites,andthe
marks ofdeath werewashed away. Thebody
wascleansed, theeyesmade clear, sostrength
andjoyreturned intothebody. Then Ke-au-
nini said:"Iamready. Iseeamultitude of
birds circling around Kaula. There isevil
toward Hawaii."
They again went into thetemple and' slept
until very early thenextmorning. Then they
took their cocoanut-husk canoes, each holding
hisown inhishand, andwentdown totheedge


220LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
oftheseaandstood there, eachpointing thenose
ofhisboattoward Waipio.
None ofthepeople awoke until they landed.
They pulled theboats upon thebeach andwent
totheir temple. Astheycame tothedoor ofthe
temple, drums beat like rolling thunder. Then
thesunarose, themists allvanished fromHawaii.
The people awoke andunderstood that their
chiefs had returned. They ranout oftheir
houses shouting and rejoicing. Olopana com-
manded thechiefs andthepeople toprepare all
kinds ofsweet foodandgiftsandthings foravery
great luau. When thiswasdone they feasted
sixty daysandreturned totheirhomes.
Lei-makani became the ruler ofHawaii.
Lono-kai-o-lohia washonored byhisfather. All
ofthe chiefs inthat generation were noted
throughout theislands.
Itwassaidthat therewasabeautiful chiefess
ofMolokai whowanted tofindayoung chief of
Hawaii forherhusband, soshesentherkahu, or
guardian, and servants tomake thejourney
while shewent back tohersleeping-place and
dreamed ofavery fineyoung chief shining like
thesunandsurrounded byallthecolors ofthe

rainbow. Then sheawoke andfound noone,
butsheloved that spirit-body which shehad
seen inherdreams, soshearoseandwentdown
tothebeach andtoldherguardian tomake haste
andreach Hawaii thatday.
When thekahu heard her call,heputforth all
hispower anduttered theproper incantations.
Hespedthrough thewaters likeaskimming bird,
passed thegreat precipices nearWaipio, andsoon
afterdawn landed onthebeautiful beach.
Thepeople hadnotyetcomefrom theirhomes
forthework oftheday.Hewentuptothe
village andcame nearthehouse ofLei-makani.
Awatchman asked where hewasfromandthe
purpose ofhisjourney. Hesaid: "Iama
stranger from Molokai, amessenger frommy
chiefess, whoseeks ahusband ofhighrank equal
toherown. Shehasnooneworthy tobeher
husband."
TheWaipio chief said:"Wehave asplendid
young chief, butthere isnoonehisequal inrank
andbeauty. Youcould notaskforhim."
Then Lei-makani heard thenoise andcame
outand asked about this conversation. His
watchman toldhim that thismanwasfrom
Molokai.
Lei-makani asked theman toapproach. The
Molokai chief thought thatLei-makani wasthe
handsomest man hehadever seen. Ke-au-kai


222 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
came outofthetemple andlooked upon the
stranger andaskedwhyhehadcome.
When helearned thatthemansought ahus-
band forhischiefess, headvised him toreturn
lestheshould meet death atthehands ofthe
watchman, butthemanwould notgoaway.
After atime thechiefs ofWaipio came before
Lei-makani. TheMolokai chief explained his
errand, andpraised hischiefess, andsaidthathe
waswilling tobekilled andcooked inanoven if
shewere notasbeautiful and ofashighrank

entered theassembly, andthestranger cried out:
"Thisman isthehusband formychiefess. Her
taburank isthesame asthetaburank ofthis
fineyoung chief. Noothers inalltheislands are
likethese two. Itwould beglorious forthem to
meet." Lono-kai said,"You return atonceand
make preparation, andIwillcome intheeven-
ing."
Thekahu returned toMolokai, butthechiefess
sawhimcoming back alone andbecame very
angry, hereyes flashing withwrath because he
hadnotbrought theyoung chief withhim. She
screamed out,"Where isthevalue ofyour jour-
ney, ifyoureturn without myhusband?"
"Wait alittle," theguardian said gently,
"until youhearabout what Ihave seenupon

Sheordered allMolokai toprepare foragreat

THEBRIDE FROMTHEUNDER-WORLD
ALegend oftheKalakaua Family
KU,oneofthemost widely known gods ofthe
Pacific Ocean, wasthought bytheHawai-
ianstohave dwelt asamortal forsome timeon
thewestern side oftheisland Hawaii. Here
hechose achiefess bythename ofHina ashis
wife,andtothemwereborntwochildren. When
hewithdrew from hisresidence among menhe
leftasonontheuplands ofthedistrict ofNorth
Kona, andadaughter ontheseashore ofthesame
district. The son, Hiku-i-kana-hele (Hiku of
theforest), lived with hismother. Thedaugh-
ter,Kewalu, dwelt under thecare ofguardian
chiefs andpriests byatemple, theruined walls
ofwhich arestanding even tothepresent day.
Here shewas carefully protected andperfected
inallartspertaining tothevery high chiefs.
Hiku-of-the-Forest wasnotaccustomed togo
tothesea. His lifewasdeveloped among the
forests along thewestern slopes ofthegreat
mountains ofHawaii. Here helearned thewis-
dom ofhismother andofthechiefs andpriests


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 225
under whose carehewasplaced.. Tohimwere
givenmany ofthesupernatural powers ofhis
father. Hismother guarded himfrom theknowl-
edgethathehadasisterandkepthimfromgoing
tothetemple bytheside ofwhich shehadher
home.
Hikuwasproficient inallthefeats ofmanly
strength and skilluponwhich chiefs ofthehighest
rank prided themselves. None ofthechiefs of
theinland districts could compare withhim in
symmetry ofform, beauty ofcountenance, and
skillinmanly sports.
Theyoung chiefnoted thesounds oftheforest
andtherushing winds along thesides ofthe
mountains. Sometimes, likestorm voices, he
heard from faroffthebeat ofthesurfalong the
coral reef.Onedayheheard anoise likethe
flapping ofthewings ofmany birds. Helooked
toward themountain, butnomultitude ofhis
feathered friends could befound. Again the
same sound awakened hiscuriosity. Henow
learned that itcame from thedistant seashore
farbelow hishome onthemountain-side.
Hiku-of-the-Forest called hismother and to-
gether they listened asagain thestrange sound
from thebeach rosealong themountain gulches
andwasechoed among the cliffs.
"EHiku," saidthemother, "that istheclap-
ping ofthehands ofalargenumber ofmenand


226LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
women. Thepeople who livebytheseaare
verymuch pleased and areexpressing their
great delight insome wonderful deed ofagreat
chief."
Day afterdaytherejoicing ofthepeople was
heard bytheyoung chief. Atlasthesent a
trusty retainer tolearn thecause ofthetumult.
Themessenger reported thathehadfound cer-
taintabu surfwaters oftheKona beach andhad
seenaveryhigh chiefess whoalone played with
hersurf-board ontheincoming waves. Her
beauty surpassed that ofanyotheramong all
thepeople, andher skill inriding thesurfwas
wonderful, exceeding that ofanyonewhom the
people hadever seen, therefore themultitude
gathered from nearandfartowatch themarvel-
ousdeeds ofthebeautiful woman. Their pleas-
urewassogreat thatwhen they clapped their
hands thesound was likethevoices ofmany
thunder-storms.
Theyoung chief saidhemust godownandsee
thisbeautiful maiden. Themother knew that
thischiefess ofsuchgreatbeauty mustbeKewalu,
the sister ofHiku. She feared that trouble
would come toKewalu ifhermore powerful
brother should findherandtakeherinmarriage,
aswas thecustom among thepeople. The
omens which hadbeenwatched concerning the
children intheir infancy hadpredicted many


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 227
serious troubles. Buttheyoungmancould not
berestrained. Hewasdetermined toseethe
wonderful woman.
Hesent hispeople togather thenuts ofthe
kukui, orcandlenut-tree, andcrush outthe oil
andprepare itforanointing hisbody. Hehad
never used asurf-board, buthecommanded his
servants toprepare thebestonethatcould be
made. Down totheseashore Hiku went with
hisretainers, down tothetabu place ofthebeau-
tifulKewalu.
Heanointed hisbody with thekukui oiluntil
itglistened likethepolished leaves oftrees;
thentaking hissurf-board hewent boldly tothe
tabu surfwaters ofhissister. Thepeople stood
inamazed silence, expecting toseespeedy pun-
ishment meted outtothedaring stranger. But
thegods oftheseafavored Hiku. Hiku had
never been totheseaside andhadhever learned
theartsofthosewhowere skilful inthewaters.
Nevertheless asheentered thewater hecarried
thesurf-board more royally thanany chief the
people hadeverknown. The sunlight shone in
splendor upon hispolished bodywhen hestood
ontheboard androde totheshore onthecrests
ofthehighest surfwaves, performing wonderful
featsbyhismagic power. Thejoyofthemulti-
tudewasunbounded, andamighty storm ofnoise
wasmadebytheclapping oftheir hands.


228 LEGENDS OF(X)DSANDGHOSTS
Kewalu andhermaidens had leftthebeach
before thecoming ofHiku andwere resting in
their grass houses inagrove ofcocoanut-trees
near theheiau. When thegreat noisemadeby
thepeople aroused hershesentoneofherfriends
tolearn thecause ofsuch rejoicing. When she
learned thatanexceedingly handsome chief ofthe
highest rankwassporting among hertabuwaters
shedetermined toseehim.
So,calling hermaidens, shewentdown tothe
seashore and firstsawHiku onthehighest crest
oftherolling surf. Shedecided atonce that she
hadnever seenaman socomely, andHiku, surf-
riding totheshore, feltthathehadnever dreamed
ofsuch graceandbeauty asmarked themaiden
whowascoming towelcome him.
When Kewalu came near shetook thewreath
ofrareandfragrant flowers which shewore
andcoming close tohimthrew itaround his
shoulders asatoken toallthepeople that she
hadtaken himtobeherhusband.
Then thejoyofthepeople surpassed allthe
pleasure ofallthedays before, forthey looked
upon thetwomost beautiful beings theyhad
ever seenandbelieved that these twowould
make gladeach other's lives.
ThusHiku married hissister, Kewalu, accord-
ingtothecustom ofthat time, because shewas
theonlyoneofallthepeople equal tohim in


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 229
rankandbeauty, andhealonewasfitted tostand
inherpresence.
Foralongtimethey lived together, sometimes
sporting among thehighest white crests ofstorm-
tossed surfwaves, sometimes enjoying theguess-
ingandgambling games inwhich theHawaiians
ofalltimes have been very expert, sometimes
chanting meles andgenealogies and telling mar-
velous stories ofseaand forest, andsometimes
feasting andresting under thetrees surrounding
their grass houses.
Hiku atlastgrewweary ofthe lifebythesea.
Hewanted theforest onthemountain andthe
cold, stimulating airoftheuplands. Buthedid
notwish totake hissister-wife withhim. Per-
haps theomens oftheir childhood hadrevealed
danger toKewalu ifsheleftherhomebythesea.
Whenever hetried tostealaway from hershe
would rush tohimand cling tohim,persuading
himtowait fornewsports andjoys.
OnenightHiku roseupvery quietly andpassed
outinto thedarkness. Ashebegan toclimb
toward theuplands theleaves ofthetrees rustled
loudly inwelcome. The night birds circled
around himandhastened himonhisway, but
Kewalu wasawakened. She called forHiku.
Again andagain shecalled, butHikuhadgone.
Sheheard hisfootsteps ashiseager tread shook
theground. Sheheard thebranches breaking


230LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
asheforced hiswaythrough theforests. Then
shehastened afterhimandherplaintive crywas
louder and clearer than thevoices ofthenight
birds.
"EHiku, return! EHiku, return!
Omylove, wait forKewalu!
Hiku goesupthe hilis;
Veryhard isthis hill,OHiku!
OHiku, mybeloved!"
ButHikubyhismagic power sentthick fogs
andmists around her. Shewasblinded and
chilled, butsheheard thecrashing ofthebranches
andferns asHiku forced hiswaythrough them,
andshepressed on, still calling:
"EHiku, beloved, return toKewalu."
Then theyoung chief threw thelong flexible
vines ofthe ieiedown into thepath. They
twined around herfeetandmade herstumble as
shetried tofollow him. Therainwasfalling all
around her,andthewaywasveryrough and
hard. Sheslipped and fellagain andagain.
Theancient chant connected with thelegend
says:
"Hiku isclimbing upthe hill.
Branches andvines areintheway,
AndKewalu isbegging himtostop.
Rain-drops arewalking ontheleaves.
Theflowers arebeaten totheground.
Hopeless thequest, butKewalu iscalling:
'EHiku, beloved! Letusgoback together.'"
Her tears, mingled with the rain, streamed
down hercheeks. Thestorm wetanddestroyed

THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 231
thekapa mantle which shehadthrown around
herasshehurried from herhome afterHiku. In
rags shetried toforce herway through the
tangled undergrowth oftheuplands, but as
shecrept forward stepbystepshestimibled and
fellagain intothecoldwetarms ofthefernsand
grasses. Then thevines crept uparound her
legsandherarmsand held her,butshetore
them loose and forced herwayupward, still
calling. Shewasbleeding where therough hands
oftheforest hadtorn herdelicate fiesh. She
wassobruised and sorefrom theblows which
thebranches hadshowered upon herthat she
could scarcely creep under them.
Atlastshecould nolonger heartheretreating
footsteps ofHiku. Then, chilled anddesolate
anddeserted, shegaveupindespair andcrept
back tothevillage. There shecrawled intothe
grasshouse where shehadbeen sohappy with
herbrother Hiku, intending toputanendtoher
life.
The ieievines heldherarmsand legs,butshe
partially disentangled herself andwound them
around herheadandneck. Soon thetendrils
grew tight and slowly butsurely choked the
beautiful chiefess todeath. Thiswasthe first
suicide intherecords ofHawaiian mythology.
Asthebody gradually became lifeless thespirit
creptupward tothelua-uhane, thedoorbywhich


232 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
itpassed outofthebody intothespirit world.
This "spirit-door" isthelittle hole inthecorner
oftheeye.Out ofitthe spirit isthought to
creep slowly asthebody becomes cold indeath.
The spirit leftthecoldbody aprisoner tothe
tangled vines, andslowly andsadly journeyed
toMilu, theUnder-world home oftheghosts of
thedeparted.
The lust oftheforest hadtaken possession of
Hiku. Hefeltthefreedom oftheswift birds
whohadbeen hiscompanions inmany anexcur-
sionintotheheavily shaded depths oftheforest
jungles. Heplunged with abandon into the
whirlandrush ofthestorm winds which hehad
called tohisaidtocheck Kewalu. Hewas
drunken with theatmosphere which hehad
breathed throughout hischildhood andyoung
manhood. When hethought ofKewalu hewas
surethathehaddriven herback toherhomeby
thetemple, where hecould findherwhen once
more heshould seektheseashore.
Hehadonlypurposed tostayawhile onthe
uplands, andthen return tohissister-wife.
Hisfather, thegodKu,hadbeenwatching him
andhad alsoseen thesuicide ofthebeautiful
Kewalu. Hesawthe spirit passdown tothe
kingdom ofMilu, thehome oftheghosts. Then
hecalled Hiku andtoldhimhow heedless and
thoughtless hehadbeen inhistreatment of


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 233
Kewalu, andhow indespair shehadtaken her
life,thespirit going totheUnder- world.
Hiku, thechild oftheforest, wasovercome with
grief. Hewasready todoanything toatone
forthesuffering hehadcaused Kewalu, andrepair
theinjury.
Kutoldhimthat onlybythemost daring
effort could hehope toregain hisloved bride.
Hecould gototheUnder-world, meet theghosts
andbring hissister back, butthiscould onlybe
done atverygreat risktohimself, foriftheghosts
discovered andcaptured himtheywould punish
himwith severest torments anddestroy allhope
ofreturning totheUpper-world.
Hiku wasdetermined tosearch theland of
Miluandfind hisbride andbring herback to
hisKonahome bythesea.Kuagreed toaid
himwith themighty power which hehadasa
god, nevertheless itwas absolutely necessary
thatHiku should descend alone andbyhisown
witand skillsecure theghost ofKewalu.
Hiku prepared acocoanut-shell fullofoilmade
from decayed kukui nuts. Thiswasvery vile
andfoul smelling. Then hemade along stout
rope ofieievines.
Kuknew where thedoor totheUnder-world
was,through whichhuman beings could godown.
Thiswasaholeneartheseashore inthevalley of
Waipio ontheeastern coast oftheisland.


234LEGENDS OFCODSANDGHOSTS
KuandHiku went toWaipio, descended the
precipitous walls ofthevalley andfound the
door tothepitofMilu. Miluwastheruler of
theUnder-world.
Hiku rubbed hisbody alloverwith therancid
kukui oilandthengave the ieievine intothe
keeping ofhisfather tohold fastwhile hemade
hisdescent intotheworld ofthespirits ofthe
dead. Slowly Ku letthevinedown until at
lastHiku stood inthestrange land ofMilu.
Noonenoticed hiscoming andsoforalittle
while hewatched theghosts, studying hisbest
method offinding Kewalu. Some oftheghosts
were sleeping; some were gambling andplay-
ingthesamegames theyhadloved sowellwhile
living intheUpper- world; others were feast-
ingandvisiting around thepoibowl astheyhad
formerly beenaccustomed todo.
Hikuknew thatthestrong odor oftherotten
oilwould behisbest protection, fornone ofthe
spirits would want totouchhimandsowould not
discover thathewasfleshandblood. Therefore
herubbed hisbody oncemore thoroughly with
the oilanddisfigured himself with dirt. Ashe
passed from place toplace searching forKewalu,
theghosts said,"What abad-smelling spirit!"
Sotheyturned away fromhimasifhewasone

Intherealm ofMilu hesawthepeople inthe

Kulioe, oneofthespirits, hadbeen playing the
kiluandhadlost allhisproperty tothedaughter
ofMiluandoneofherfriends. HesawHiku
and said,"Ifyouareaskilfulmanperhaps you
should play with these two girls." Hiku said:
"Ihave nothing. Ihave onlycome thisday
andamalone." Kulioe bethisbones against
some oftheproperty hehad lost.The first
girlthrew hercup atthe kilu post. Hiku
chanted:
"Areyouknown byPapaandWakea,
Oeyelashes orrays ofthesun?
Mine isthecupofkilu."
Hercupdidnottouch thekilupost before Hiku.
Shethrew again, butdidnottouch, whileHiku
chanted thesame words. They tookanewcup,
butfailed.
Hikucommenced swinging thecupandthrew.
Itglided andtwisted around onthefloorand
struck thepost. Thiscounted fiveandwonthe
first bet.Then hethrew thecupnumbered
twenty, won alltheproperty andgave itback
toKulioe.
Atlasthefound Kewalu, butshewasbythe
side ofthehigh chief, Milu,whohadseen the
beautiful princess asshecame intotheUnder-
world. More glorious wasKewalu than any
other ofallthose ofnoble bloodwhohadever


236LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
descended toMilu. Theghosts hadwelcomed
thespirit oftheprincess withgreat rejoicing, and
thekinghad called heratonce tothehighest
place inhiscourt.
Shehadnotbeen longwith thechiefs ofMilu
before theyasked hertosingorchant hermele.
Themelewasthefamily songbywhich apy

which hewasconnected, whenever hevisited
chiefs faraway from hisownhome.
Hiku heard thechant andmingled with the
multitude ofghosts gathered around theplace
where thehigh chiefs werewelcoming thespirit
ofKewalu.
While Hiku andKewalu hadbeen living to-
gether one oftheir pleasures wascomposing
andlearning tointone achant which noother
among either mortals orspirits should know
besides themselves.
While Kewalu wassinging sheintroduced her
part ofthischant. Suddenly fromamong the
throng ofghosts arose thesound ofaclear voice
chanting theresponse which wasknown byno
other person butHiku.
Kewalu wasovercome bythethought that
perhaps Hikuwasdeadandwasnowamong the
ghosts, butdidnotdare toincur thehatred of
King Milubymaking himself known; orper-
hapsHiku hadendured many dangers ofthe


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 237
lower world bycoming even inhuman form to
findherandtherefore must remain concealed.
Thepeople around theking, seeing her grief,
were notsurprised when shethrew amantle
around herself and leftthem togoaway alone
intotheshadows.
Shewandered from place toplaceamong the
groups ofghosts, looking forHiku. Sometimes
shesoftly chanted herpart ofthemele. Atlast
shewasagain answered andwassurethatHiku
wasnear,buttheonlyonevery closewasafoul-
smelling, dirt-covered ghost fromwhom shewas
turning away indespair.
Hiku inalowtonewarned hertobevery
careful andnotrecognize him,butassured her
thathehadcome inperson torescue herand
take herback toheroldhome where herbody
wasthen lying. Hetoldhertowander around
andyettofollow him until theycame tothe
ieievinewhich hehad lefthanging from thehole
which opened totheUpper-world.
When Hikucame totheplace where thevine
washanging hetookhold tosee ifKu,hisfather,
was stillcarefully guarding theother endtopull
himupwhen theright signal should begiven.
Having made himself sure oftheaidofthegod,
hetiedtheendofthevine intoastrong loopand
seated himself init.Then hebegan toswing
backandforth, backandforth, sometimes rising


238 LEGENDS OFGODSANDGHOSTS
highandsometimes checking himself andresting
with hisfeetontheground.
Kewalu came nearandbegged tobeallowed
toswing, butHiku would only consent onthe
condition thatshewould sitinhislap.
Theghosts thought that thiswould beanex-
cellent arrangement andshouted their approval
ofthenew sport. ThenHiku took thespirit of
Kewalu inhisstrong armsandbegan toswing
slowly back and forth, thenmore andmore
rapidly, higher andhigher until thepeople mar-
velled atthe,wonderful skill. Meanwhile he
gave thesignal toKutopullthem up.Almost
imperceptibly theswing receded from thespirit
world.
AllthistimeHiku hadbeen gently and lov-
ingly rubbing the spirit ofKewalu and softly
uttering charm aftercharm sothat while they
wereswaying intheairshewasgrowing smaller
andsmaller. Even thechiefs ofMiluhadbeen
attracted tothisunusual sport, andhaddrawn
near towatch thewonderful skill ofthestrange
foul-smelhng ghost.
Suddenly itdawned uponsome ofthebeholders
thatthevinewasbeing drawn uptotheUpper-
world. Then thecryarose:"He isstealing the
woman!" "He isstealing thewoman!"
TheUnder-world was inagreat uproar of
noise. Some oftheghosts were leaping ashigh


THEBRIDE FROM THEUNDER-WORLD 239
asthey could, others were calling forHiku to
return, and others were uttering charms to
cause hisdownfall.
Noonecould leaphighenough totouch Hiku,
andthepower ofallthecharms wasdefeated by
thegodKu,whorapidly drew thevineupward.
Hiku succeeded incharming theghost ofKe-
walu intothecocoanut-shell which hestillcarried.
Then stopping theopening tight with hisfingers
sothat thespirit could notescape hebrought
Kewalu back totheland ofmortals.
With theaidofKuthesteep precipices sur-
rounding Waipio Valley were quickly scaled and
thejourney made tothetemple bythetabu
surfwaters ofKona. Here thebody ofKewalu
hadbeen l)dng instate. Here theauwe, or
mourning chant, oftheretinue ofthedead
princess could beheard from afar.
Hiku passed through thethrongs ofmourners,
carefully guarding hisprecious cocoanut until
hecame tothe feet, coldand stiff indeath.
Kneeling down heplaced thesmall hole inthe
endoftheshell against thetender spot inthe
bottom ofoneofthecold feet.
The spirits ofthedeadmust find theirway
back Uttlebylittle through thebody from the

when they bidfinal farewell totheworld. To
trytosend the spirit back into thebody by

placing itinthelua-uhane, or"door ofthesoul,"

thebody rather than enter it.
Hikuremoved hisfinger from thehole inthe
cocoanut and uttered theincantations which
would allure theghost intothebody. Little by
little thesoul ofKewalu came back, andthe
bodygrewwarm from thefeetupward, until at

Note.—Alover oflegends should now read"The
Deceiving ofKewa" intheAppendix, alegend which
shows conclusively theconnection some centuries ago
between theHawaiians andtheMaoris ofNew Zealand.


APPENDIX
THEDECEIVING OFKEWA
Apoem, ormourning chant, oftheMaoris ofNewZealand
hasmany references tothedeeds oftheir ancestors inHawaiki,
which inthis case surely has reference totheHawaiian
Islands. Among the first lines ofthispoem istheexpres-
sion,"Kewa wasdeceived." Anexplanatory note isgiven
which covers almost twopages oftheJournal ofthePoly-
nesian Society inwhich thepoem ispublished. Inthis
note theoutline ofthestory ofthedeceiving ofKewa is
quite fully translated, and issubstantially thesame as"The
Bride from theUnder-world."
"The Deceiving ofKewa," astheNewZealand story is
called, hasthisrecord among theMaoris. "This narrative
isofold,ofancient times, very, very old. 'The Deceiving
ofKewa' isanold,oldstory." Milu insome parts ofthe
Pacific isthename oftheplace where thespirits ofthedead
dwell. Sometimes itisthename oftheruler ofthat place.
Inthisancient New Zealand legend ittakes theplace of
Hiku, and isthename oftheperson whogoesdown intothe
depths after hisbride, while thespirit-king iscalled Kewa,
apart ofthename Kewalu, which wasthename ofthe
Hawaiian bride whose ghost wasbrought back from the
grave.
This, then, istheNewZealand legend, "The Deceiving of
Kewa." There once lived inHawaiki achiefand hiswife.
They hadachild, agirl,born tothem; then themother
died. The chief took another wife,whowasnotpleasing
tothepeople. Hisanger wassogreat thatthechiefwent
away tothegreat forest ofTane (thegodKane inHawaiian),
andthere builtahouse forhimself andhiswife.
After atimeasonwasborn tothem andthefather named
himMiru. This father wasagreat tohunga (kahuna), or
priest, aswellasachief. Hetaught Miru allthesupreme
kinds ofknowledge, alltheinvocations andincantations, those


242 APPENDIX
forthestars, forthewinds, forfoods, forthesea,andforthe
land.Hetaught himthepeculiar incantations which would
enable him tomeet allcunning tricks andenmities ofman.
Helearned also allthegreat powers ofwitchcraft. Itis
saidthatononeoccasion Miruandhisfather went toariver,
agreat river. Here thechild experimented with hispower-
fulcharms. Hewasachild oftheforest andknew the
charm which could conquer the trees.Now there wasa
talltreegrowing bytheside oftheriver. When Mirusaw
itherecited hisincantations. Ashecame totheendthe
tree fell, thehead reaching right across the river. They
leftthetreeIjdng inthisway that itmight beused asa
bridge bythepeople whocame totheriver. Thus hewas
conscious ofhispower tocorrectly usethemighty invocations
which hisfather hadtaught him.
Theyears passed andtheboybecame ayoung man. His
wasalonely life,andheoften wondered ifthere were not
thosewhocould behiscompanions. Atlastheasked his
parents: "Arewehere, allofus?Have Inoother relative
intheworld?"
Hisparents answered, "You have asister, butshedwells
atadistant place."
When Miru heard thishearose andproceeded tosearch
forhissister, andhehappily came tothevery place where
shedwelt. There theyoung people were gathered intheir
customary place forplaying teka (Hawaiian keha). The
tekawasadartwhich wasthrown along theground, usually
thehardbeach oftheseashore. Miru watched thegame for
some timeandthenreturned tohishome intheforest. He
told hisfather about thetekaandtheway itwasplayed.
Then thechief prepared ateka forMiru, selected from the
best treeand fashioned while appropriate charms were
repeated.
Miru threw hisdartalong theslopes covered bytheforest
and itsunderbrush, butQieground wasuneven andthe
undergrowth retarded thedart. Then Miru found aplain
andpractised untilhewasvery expert.
After awhile hecame totheplace where hissister lived.
When theyoung people threw their darts hethrew his.Aha!
itflewindeed andwas lostinthedistance. When thesister

they rested, andMiru letgotheanchor. Hethen said to
hiscompanions, "When you seetheanchor rope shaking,

Miru carried withhim hisnetswhich were given magic

Inmany ways heendeavored toinduce herghost tocome

entered thebodyandthesister wasalive again. This isthe
endofthenarrative, but itisofold,ofancient times, very,
very old."The Deceiving ofKewa" isanold,oldstory.
IntheMaori poem inwhich thereference toKewa ismade
which brought outtheabove translation ofoneoftheold
NewZealand stories arealsomany other references tosemi-
historical characters andevents. Attheclose ofthepoem
isthefollowing note: "The lament issofullofreferences to
theancient history oftheMaoris that itwould takeavolume
toexplain them all.Most oftheincidents referred tooc-
curred inHawaiki before themigration oftheMaoris toNew
Zealand oratleast fivehundred tosixhundred years ago."
Another NewZealand legend ought tobenoticed incon-
nection with theHawaiian story ofHiku (Miru,NewZealand)
seeking hissister intheUnder-world. Inwhat isprobably
themore complete Hawaiian storyHikuhadamagic arrow
which flewlong distances andledhim totheplace where his
sister-wife could befound.
InaNewZealand legend amagic dart leads achiefbythe
name ofTama inhissearch forhiswife,whohadbeen carried
away tospirit-land. Hethrew thedartandfollowed itfrom
place toplace until hefound awrecked canoe, nearwhich
laythebody ofhiswifeandhercompanions. Hetried to
bring herback tolife,buthisincantations were notstrong
enough torelease thespirit.
Evidently theHawaiian legend became alittle fragmen-
tary while being transplanted from theHawaiian Islands to
New Zealand. Hiku, theyoung chiefwhoovercomes Miru
ofthespirit-world, loses hisname entirely. Kewalu, the
sister, also loses hername, apart ofwhich, Kewa, isgiven
totheruler oftheUnder-world, andthemagic dart isplaced
inthehands ofTama inanentirely distinct legend which
stiUkeeps thethought ofthewife-seeker. There canscarcely
beanyquestion butthat theoriginal legend belongs tothe
Hawaiian Islands, andwas carried toNew Zealand inthe
days ofthesea-rovers.


HOMELESS ANDDESOLATE GHOSTS 245
HOMELESS ANDDESOLATE GHOSTS
The spirits ofthedead, according toasummary ofancient
Hawaiian statements, were divided into three classes, each
class bearing theprefix "ao," which meant either theen-
lightened orinstructed class, orsimply acrowd ornumber of
spirits grouped together.
The first class, theAo-Kuewa, were thedesolate andthe
homeless spirits whoduring their residence inthebodyhad
nofriends andnoproperty.
Thesecond classwascalled theAo-Aumakuas. These were
thegroups ofghost-gods orspirit-ancestors oftheHawaiians.
They usually remained near their oldhome ashelpful pro-
tectors ofthefamily towhich they belonged, andwerewor-
shipped bythefamily.
Thethird classwastheAo-o-Milu. Miluwasthechiefgod
oftheUnder-world throughout thegreater part ofPolynesia.
Many times theUnder-world itself bore thename ofMilu.
TheAo-o-Milu were thesouls ofthedeparted ofboth the
preceding classes whohadperformed alltasks, passed all
barriers, andfound their proper place intheland oftheking
ofghosts.
The oldHawaiians never intelligently classified these
departed spirits andsometimes mixed them together ininex-
tricable confusion, butinthelegends andremarks ofearly
Hawaiian writers these three classes areroughly sketched.
Thedesolate ghost hadnoright tocallanyplace itshome,
towhich itcould come, overwhich itcould watch, and4round
which itcould hover. Ithad togotothedesolate parts of
theislands orintoawilderness orforest.
Thehomeless ghosthadnoonetoprovide even theshadow
offood for it.Ithadtogointothedark places andsearch
forbutterflies, spiders, andother insects. These were the
ordinary food forallghosts unless there were worshippers
toplace offerings onsecret altars, which were often dedicated
togainaspecial power ofpraying other people todeath. Such
ghosts were wellcared for,but,ontheother hand, thedesolate
onesmustwander andsearch until they could godown into
theland ofMilu.
There were several ways which thegodshadprepared for
ghosts touseinthisjourney totheUnder- world. Itisinter-


246 APPENDIX
esting tonote that allthrough Polynesia aswell asinthe
Hawaiian Islands thepath forghosts ledwestward.
Thestudents ofNewZealand folk-lore willsaythat this
signified thedesire ofthose about todietoreturn totheland
oftheir ancestors beyond thewestern ocean.
Thepaths were called Leina-a-ka-uhane (paths-for-leaping-
by-the-spirit). They were almost always onbold bluffs
looking westward over theocean. The spirit unless driven
back couldcome totheheadland andleapdown intotheland
ofthedead, butwhen thiswasdone that spirit could never
return tothebody ithad left. Frequently connected with
these Leina-a-ka-uhane wasabreadfruit-tree which would
beagathering-place forghosts.
Atthese places there were often friendly ghosts who
would helpandsometimes return thespirit tothebody or
send ittojointheAo-Aumakuas (ancestor ghosts). Atthe
place ofdescent itwas said there wasanowawa (ditch)
through which theghosts onebyonewere carried down to
Po,andLei-lono wasthegatewhere theghosts were killed
astheywent down. Near thisgateway wastheUlu-o-lei-'
walo, orbreadfruit-tree ofthe spirits. This treehadtwo
branches, onetoward theeastandonetoward thewest,
both ofwhich wereusedbytheghosts. Onewasforleaping
intoeternal darkness intoPo-pau-ole, theother asameeting-
place with thehelpful gods.
This treealways bore thename Ulu-o-lei-walo (the-
quietly-calling-breadfruit-tree). Onthe island ofOahu,
oneofthesewas said tohavebeen atKaena Point; another
wasinNuuanu Valley.
The desolate ghost would come tothismeeting-place of
thedeadandtrytofindaghost ofthesecond class, the
aumakuas, whohadbeen oneofhisancestors andwho still
hadsome family towatch over. Perhaps thisonemight
entertain orhelphim.
Iftheghost could findnoonetotakehim, thenhewould
trytowander around thetreeandleap into thebranches.
The rotten, deadbranches ofthetreebelonged tothespirits.
When theybroke and fell,thespirits onthem dropped into
theland ofMilu^the under-world home ofghosts. Often
thespirit could leapfrom thesedeadbranches intotheUnder-
world.
Sometimes thedesolate spirit would beblown, asbythe
wind, backandforth, hereand there, untilnopossible place


HOMELESS ANDDESOLATE GHOSTS 247
ofrestcould befound ontheisland where death hadcome;
then theghost would leapintothesea,hoping tofindtheway
toMilu through some sea-cave. Perhaps thewaves would
carry theghost, oritmight beable toswim toone ofthe
other islands, where anewsearch would bemade forsome
ancestor-ghost from which toobtain help. Not finding
aid, itwould bepushed anddriven over rough, rocky places
andthrough thewilderness until itagain went intothesea.
Atlastperhaps awaywould befound into thehome ofthe
dead, andtheghost would have aplace inwhich tolive,
oritmightmake theround through thewilderness again and
again, until itcould leapfromabluff, orfallfromarotten
branch ofthebreadfruit-tree.
Agreat caterpillar wasthewatchman ontheeastern side
oftheleaping-off place. Napaha wasthewestern boundary.
Amo-o (dragon) wasthewatchman onthat side. Ifthe
ghost was afraid ofthem itwent back tosecure thehelp
oftheghost-gods inorder togetby.TheHawaiians were
afraid that thesewatchmen would killghosts ifpossible.
Ifacaterpillar obstructed theway itwould raise itshead
over theedge ofthe bluff, andthen thefrightened ghost
would gofaroutofitsway,andwandering around bedestroyed
orcompelled toleap offsomedeadbranch intoeternal dark-
ness. But ifthat frightened ghost, while wandering, could
findahelpful ghost god, itwould bekept alive, although
stillawanderer over theislands.
Atthefield ofkaupea (coral) nearBarbers Point, inthe
desert ofPuuloa, theghost would goaround among thelehua
flowers, catching spiders, butterflies, and insects forfood,
where theghost-gods might findthemandgivethem aidin
escaping thewatchmen.
There aremany places fortheLeina-a-ka-uhane (leaping-
off-places) andtheUlu-o-lei-walo (breadfruit-trees) onallthe
islands. Tothese places thewandering desolate ghosts went
tofindaway totheUnder-world.
Another name forthewandering ghosts waslapu, also
sometimes called Akua-hele-loa (great travellers). These
ghosts were frequently those who enjoyed fooUsh, silly
pranks. They would sweep over theoldbyways introops,
dancing and playing. They would gather around theold
matswhere theliving hadbeen feasting, and sitandfeaston
imaginary food.
TheHawaiians say:"On one side oftheisland Oahu,


248 APPENDIX
even tothisdaythelapucome atnight. Their ghostdrums
andsacred chants canbeheard and their misty forms seen
astheyhover about theruins oftheoldheiaus (temples)."
The finemists orfogs ofManoa Valley weresupposed to
conceal alargecompany ofpriests andtheir attendants while
roaming among thegreat stones which still liewhere there
wasapuu-honua (refuge-temple) intheearly days. Ifany
onesawthese roving ghosts hewascalled lapu-ia, oroneto
whom spirits hadappeared.
TheHawaiians said:"The lapughosts were notsupposed
towatch over thewelfare ofthepersons they met. They
never went intotheheavens tobecome black clouds, bringing
rain forthebenefit oftheir households. They didnotgo
outafter winds toblow with destructive force against their
enemies. Thiswastheearnest work oftheancestor-ghosts,
andwasnotdonebythelapu."
Another name forghosts was wai-lua, which referred
especially tothe spirit leaving thebody andsupposed to
have been seenbysome one. This wai-lua spirit could be
driven back intothebodybyother ghosts, orpersuaded to
come back through offerings orincantations givenbyliving
friends, sothatadeadperson couldbecome alive again.
Itwasfirmly believed that aperson could endure many
deaths, andthat ifanyonelostconsciousness hewasdead,
and thatwhen lifestopped itwasbecause the spirit left
thebody. When hfewasrenewed itwasbecause thespirit
hadreturned toitsformer home.
Thekino-wai-lua wasaghost leaving thebody ofaliving
person andreturning afteratime, aswhen anyonefainted.
Besides theghosts ofthedead, theHawaiians gave spirit
power toallnatural objects. Large stones were supposed
tohavedragon power sometimes.
AUMAKUAS, ORANCESTOR-GHOSTS
There aretwomeanings tothe firstpart ofthisword, for
"au" means amultitude, asin"auwaa" (many canoes), but
itmaymean timeand place, asinthefollowing: "Our
ancestors thought that ifthere wasadesolate place where
noman could befound, itwastheaumakua (place ofmany
gods)." "Makua" wasthename given totheancestors of
achiefandofthepeople aswellastoparents.


AUMAKUAS, ORANCESTOR-GHOSTS 249
Theaumakuas were theghosts whodidnotgodown into
Po,theland ofKing Milu. They were intheland ofthe
living, hovermg around thefamilies from which theyhad
been separated bydeath. They were theguardians ofthese
families.
When anyonedied,many devices wereemployed indispos-
ingofthebody. The fact thatanenemy ofthefamily
might endeavor tosecure thebones ofthedead forthepur-
pose ofmaking them into fish-hooks, arrow-heads, orspear-
heads ledthesurviving members ofafamily either todestroy
ortoconceal thebody ofthedead. For ifthebones were
soused itmeant great dishonor, andthespirit wassupposed
tosuffer onaccount ofthisindignity.
Sometimes thefleshwasstripped from thebones andcast
intotheocean orintothefires ofthevolcanoes, thattheghost
might bemade apart ofthefamily ghosts who lived insuch
places, andthebones wereburied insome secret cave orpit,
orfolded together inabundle which wasthought toresemble
agrasshopper, sothese were called unihipili (grasshopper).
The unihipili bones were used inconnection withastrange
belief called pule-ana-ana (praying todeath).
When thebody ofadead person wastobehidden, only
twoorthreemenwereemployed inthetask. Sometimes
theonehighest inrankwould slay hishelpers sothatno
oneexcept himself would know theburial-place.
The tools, theclothing, andthecalabashes ofthedead
were unclean until certain ceremonies ofpurification had
been faithfully performed. Many times these possessions
were either placed intheburial-cave beside thebody orburned
sothattheymight betheproperty ofthespirit inghost-
land.
Thepeople whocared forthebodyhad tobathe insalt
water andseparate themselves from thefamily foratime.
Theymust sprinkle thehouse and allthings inside with salt
water. After afewdays thefamily would return andoccupy
thehouse oncemore.
Usually thecaretakers ofadeadbody would make ahole
inthesideofthehouse andpush itthrough rather than take
itthrough theolddoorway, probably having theidea that
theghost would onlyknow thedoor through which the
bodyhadgoneoutwhen aliveandsocould notfindthenew
waybackwhen theopening wasclosed.
After death came, theghost crept outofthebody, coming


250 APPENDIX
upfrom thefeetuntil itrested intheeyes,andthen itcame
outfrom thecomer ofoneeye,andhadakind ofwindbody.
Itcould passaround theroom andoutofdoors through
anyopeYiing itcould find. Itcoidd perch likeabirdonthe
roof ofahouse orinthebranches oftrees, oritcould seat
itself onlogsorstones near thehouse. Itmight have to
goback into thebody andmake itlive again. Possibly
theghost might meetsome oldancestor-ghosts andbeled
sofaraway that itcould notreturn; then itmustbecome a
member oftheaumakua, orancestor-ghost, family, orwander
offtojointhehomeless desolate ghost vagabonds.
Sometimes dead bodies werethrown intotheseawith the
hope that theghost body would become ashark oraneel,
orperhaps amo-o, ordragon-god, tobeworshipped withother
ancestor-gods ofthe'same class.
Sometimes thebody orthebones would becastinto the
crater ofKilauea, thepeople thinking thespiritwould become
aflame offire like Pele, thegoddess ofvolcanoes; other
spirits went intotheairconcealed inthedarkdepths ofthe
sky,perhaps intheclouds.
Here they carried onthework needed tohelp their fam-
ilies. They would become fogormistorthefinemisty rain
colored bylight. With these theRainbow Maiden, Anueiiue,
delighted todwell. They often lived inthegreat rolling white
clouds, orinthegray clouds which letfallthequiet rain
needed forfarming. They also lived inthe fierce black
thunder-clouds which sentdown floods ofadevastating
character upon theenemies ofthefamily towhich they
belonged.
There wereghost ancestors whomade theirhomes near the
places where themembers oftheir families toiled; there were
ancestor-ghosts totakecare ofthetapa, orkapa, makers, or
thecalabash orhouse orcanoe makers. There were special
ancestor-ghosts called upon byname bythefarmers, the
fishermen, and thebird-hunters. These ghosts had their
ownkuleanas, orplaces towhich theybelonged, andinwhich
theyhad theirown peculiar duties and privileges. They
became ancestor ghost-gods anddwelt ontheislands near
thehomes oftheir worshippers, orintheairabove, orinthe
treesaround thehouses, orintheocean orintheglowing
firesofvolcanoes. They evendwelt inhuman beings, making
them shake orsneeze aswith cold,andthenaperson was
saidtobecome anipu,orcalabash containing aghost.


AUMAKUAS, ORANCESTOR-GHOSTS 251
Sometimes itwasthought thataghost godcould beseen
sitting onthehead orshoulder oftheperson towhom it
belonged. Even inthistwentieth century anative woman
toldthewriter thatshesawaghost-god whispering inhisear
while hewasmaking anaddress. She said,"That ghost
waslikeafireoracolored light." Many times theHawaiians
have testified that they believed inthepresence oftheir
ancestor ghost-gods.
This istheway thepresence ofaghost wasdetected:
Some sound would beheard, such asasibilant noise, asoft
whistle, orsomething likemurmurs, orsome sensation ina
part ofthebody might befelt. Ifaneyelid trembled, a
ghost wassitting onthat spot.Aquivering orcreepy feeling
inanypart ofthebodymeant thataghost wastouching that
place. Ifanyofthese things happened, aperson would cry
out,"Ihave seenorfeltaspirit ofthegods."
Sometimes people thought theysawthe spirits oftheir
ghost friends. They believed thatthespirits ofthese friends
appeared inthenight, sometimes tokillanyonewhowas
intheway. Thehigh chiefs andwarriors aresupposed to
march andgoincrowds, carrying their spears andpiercing
those theymet unless some ghost recognized thatoneand
called totheothers, "Alia [wait]," but ifthewordwas"0-i-o
[throw thespear]!" then that spirit's spear would strike
death tothepasser-by.
There were night noises which thenatives attributed to
sounds orrustling motions madebysuch night gods asthe
following:
Akua-hokio (whistling gods).
"
.-kiei (peeping gods).
"-nalo (prying gods).
"-loa(long gods).
"-poko (short gods).
"-mulii (sibilant gods).
Aprayer tothese read thus:
"OAkua-loa! [long god]
OAkua-poko! [short god]
Akua-muki! [godbreathing inshort, sibilant breaths]
Akua-hokio! [godblowing likewhistling winds]
OAkua-kiei! [godwatching, peeping atonej
OAkua-nalo! [god hiding, slipping outofsight]
OAllyeGods,whotravel onthedark night paths!
Come andeat.
Give lifetome,
Andmyparents,
Andmychildren,
Touswhoareliving inthisplace. Amama [Amen].


252 APPENDIX
Thisprayer wasoffered every night asaprotection against
theghosts.
Theaumakuas werevery laka(tame andhelpful). Itwas
saidthatanaumakua living inashark would bevery laka,
andwould come toberubbed onthehead, opening hismouth
forasacrifice. Perhaps some awa, ormeat, would beplaced
inhismouth, andthenhewould goaway. Soalso iftheau-
makua were abird, itwould become tame. Ifitwere the
alae (asmall duck), itwould come tothehand ofitswor-
shipper; ifthepueo (owl), itwould come andscratch the
earthaway from thegrave ofoneofitsworshippers, throwing
thesandaway with itswings, andwould bring thebody
back tolife.Anowlancestor-god would come and seta
worshipper freewereheaprisoner withhands andfeetbound
byropes.
Itmade nodifference whether thedead person weremale
orfemale, child oraged one,thespirit couldbecome aghost-
godandwatch overthefamily.
There were altars fortheancestor-gods inalmost every land.
These were frequently only little piles ofwhite coral, but
sometimes chiefswould build asmall house fortheir ancestor-
gods, thusmaking homes thattheghosts might have akuleana,
orplace oftheir own,where offerings could beplaced, and
prayers offered, andrestenjoyed.
TheHawaiians have this tosayabout sacrifices forthe
aumakuas: Ifamo-o, ordragon-god, wasangry with its
caretaker orhisfamily andtheybecame weak and sick,
theywould sacrifice aspotted dogwithawa, red fish,red
sugar-cane, andsome ofthegrass growing Intaropatches
wrapped inyellow kapa. Thistheywould take tothelua,
orhole,where themo-o dwelt, andfasten thebundle there.
Then themo-o would become pleasant andtakeaway the
sickness. Ifitwere ashark-god, thesacrifice wasablack pig,
adark redchicken, andsomeawawrapped innewwhitekapa
made byavirgin. This bundle would becarried tothe
beach, where aprayer would beoffered:
"Oaumakuas from sunrise tosunset,
From North toSouth, fromabove andbelow,Ospirits oftheprecipice and spirits ofthesea,
Allwhodwell inflowing waters,
Here isasacrifice—ourgifts aretoyou.
Bring lifetous,toallthefamily.
Totheoldpeople withwrinkled skin,
Totheyoung also.
This isour life.
From thegods."


AUMAKUAS, ORANCESTOR-GHOSTS 253
Then thefarmer would throw thebundle intothesea,bury
thechicken aUve, takethepigtothetemple, thengobade to
hishouse looking forrain. Iftherewas rain, itshowed that
theaimiakua hadseenthegiftsandwashed away thewrong.
Iftheclouds became black withheavy rain, thatwas well.
The offerings forPeleandHiiaka wereawa todrink and
food toeat,infact allthings which could betaken tothe
crater.
This applies tothefour great gods, Kane, Ku,Lono, and
Kanaloa. They arecalled the first oftheancestors. Each
oneofthese wassupposed tobeable toappear inanumber
ofdifferent forms, therefore eachhadanumber ofnames
expressive oftheworkheintended orwasdesired todo.An
explanatory adjective orphrase wasadded tothegod'sown
name, defining certain acts orcharacteristics, thus: Kane-
puaa (Kane, thepig)wasKanewhowould aidinstirring up
theground likeapig.
This isoneoftheprayers usedwhen presenting offerings
toaumakuas, "OAumakuas oftherising ofthesun,guarded
byevery tabu staff, here areofferings and sacrifices—the
black pig,thewhite chicken, theblack cocoanut, thered
fish—sacrifices forthegodsand alltheaumakuas; those of
theancestors, those ofthenight, andofthedawn, hereamI.
Let lifecome."
Theancestor-gods were supposed tousewhatever object
theyUved with. Ifghosts wentupinto theclouds, they
moved theclouds from place toplaceandmadethemassume
such shapes asmight befancied. Thus theywould reveal
themselves over their oldhomes.
Alltheaumakuas weresupposed tobegentle andready to
help theirown families. The oldHawaiians saythat the
power oftheancestor-gods wasvery great. "Here isthe
magic power. Suppose amanwould callhisshark,'OKuhai-
moana [theshark-god]! O,theOnewho lives intheOcean!
Takemetotheland!' Then perhaps ashark would appear,
andthemanwould getontheback oftheshark, hold fastto
the fin,andsay:'You lookahead. Goonvery swiftly with-
outwaiting.' Then theshark would swim swiftly tothe
shore."
TheoldHawaiians hadthesport called "lua." Thissome-
timesmeant wrestUng, butusually wasthegame ofcatching
aman, lifting himup,andbreaking hisbody sothathewas
killed. Awrestler oftheluaclasswould goouttoaplain


254 APPENDIX
where nopeople were dwelling and call hisgodKuialua.
Theaumakua ghost-god would give thisman strength and
skill,andhelphimtokillhisadversaries.
There weremany priests ofdifferent classes whoprayed to
theancestor-gods. Those ofthefarmers prayed like this:
"Ogreat black cloud inthe£ar-off sky,
Oshadow watching shadow,
Watch overourland.
Overshadow ourland
Fromcomer tocorner
From sidetoside.
Donotcastyourshadow onother lands
Nor letthewaters fallontheother lands
[i.e.,keep therains overmyplace]."
Also theyprayed toKane-puaa (Kane, thepig), thegreat
amnakua offarmers:
"OKane-puaa, root!
Diginland, digtoward thesea;
Digfromcomer tocomer,
From sidetoside;
Letthefoodgrow inthemiddle,
Potatoes ontheside roots.
Fruit inthecentre.
Donotrootinanother place I
Thepeoplemay strike youwiththespade [o-o]
Orhityouwithastone
Andhurtyou.Amama [Amen]."
Soalsotheyprayed toKukea-olo-walu (ataroaumakua
god):
"OKukea-olo<walu!
Make thetarogrow.
Lettheleafspread likeabanana.
Taro forus,OKukea!
Thebanana andthetaro forus.

Pound thetaro.

Give lifetous—
Tothefarmers—
From sunrise tosunset
From onefastened place totheother fastened place
[i.e.,oneside oftheskytotheother fastened oneach sideofthe
earth]. Amama [Amen]."
Trees with their branches and fruit were frequently en-
dowed with spirit power. Allthedifferent kinds ofbirds
andeven insects, andalsotheclouds andwinds andthefish
intheseaswere given aplaceamong thespirits around the
Hawaiians.


THEDRAGON GHOST-GODS 255
Thepeople believed inlifeand itsmany forms ofpower.
They would pray totheunseen forces forlifeforthemselves
and their friends, andfordeath tocomeonthefamihes of
their enemies. They had special priests and incantations
forthepule-ana-ana, orpraying todeath, andeven tothe
present time thesupposed power topray todeath isoneof
themost formidable terrors totheir imagination.
Menehunes, eepas, andkupuas were classes offairies or
gnomes which didnotbelong totheancestor-gods, orau-
makuas.
Themenehunes were fairy servants. Some ofthePolyne-
sianIslands called thelowest class ofservants "manahune."
TheHawaiians separated them almost entirely from the
spirits ofancestors. They worked atnight perforihing
prodigious tasks which theywere never supposed totouch
again after thecoming ofdawn.
Theeepas were usually deformed and defective gnomes.
They suffered from allkinds ofweakness, sometimes having
nobones andnomore power tostand than alarge leaf.
They weresometimes setapart asspirit caretakers oflittle
children. Nuuanu Valley wasthehome ofamultitude of
eepaswhohad their temple onthewestern side ofthe
v^ey.
Kupuas were thedemons ofghost-land. They were very
powerful andvery destructive. Nohuman being could
withstand their attacks unless specially endowed with
power from thegods. They hadanimal aswell ashuman
bodies andcould usewhichever body seemed tobemost
available. The dragons, ormo-os, were themost terrible
kupuas intheislands.
THEDRAGON GHOST-GODS
Dragons wereamong theghost-gods ofthe ancient
Hawaiians. These dragons were called mo-o. TheNew
Zealanders used thesamenames forsome oftheir large reptile
gods. They, Jiowever, spelled theword witha"k," caUing
itmo-ko, and itwasalmost identical inpronunciation asin
meaning with theHawaiian name. Both theHawaiians
andNewZealanders called allkinds oflizards mo-o ormo-ko;
and their useofthisword intraditions showed thatthey
oftenhadinmind animals likecrocodiles and alligators, and


2S6 APPENDIX
sometimes they referred thename toanymonster ofgreat
mythical powers belonging toaman-destroying class.
Mighty eels, irrmiense sea-turtles, large fishoftheocean,
fierce sharks, were allcalled mo-o. Themost ancient dragons
oftheHawaiians arespoken ofasliving inpools orlakes.
These dragons wereknown also askupuas, ormysterious
characters who could appear asanimals orhuman beings
according totheir wish. Thesaying was:"Kupuas have a
strange double body."
There weremany other kupuas besides those ofthedragon
family. Itwassometimes thought that atbirth another
natural formwasadded, such asaneggofafowl orabird,
ortheseed ofaplant, ortheembryo ofsome animal, which
when fully developed made aform which could beused as
readily asthehuman body. These kupuas were always
given some great magic power. They were wonderfully
strong andwiseand skilful.
Usually thebirth ofakupua, likethebirth ofahigh chief,
wasattended with strange disturbances intheheavens, such
asreverberating thunder, flashing lightning, and severe
storms which senttheabundant red soiloftheislands down
themountain-sides inblood-red torrents known aska-ua-koko
(theblood rain). Thisnamewasalsogiven tomisty finerain
when shotthrough bytheredwaves ofthesun.
Byfarthelargest class ofkupuas wasthat ofthedragons.
These allbelonged toonefamily. Their ancestor wasMo-o-
inanea (The Self-reliant Dragon), who figured verypromi-
nently intheHawaiian legends ofthemost ancient times,
such as"TheMaiden oftheGolden Cloud."
Mo-o-inanea (The Self-reliant Dragon) brought the
dragons, thekupua dragons, from the"Hidden Land of
Kane" totheHawaiian Islands. Mo-o-inanea wasappar-
ently ademi-goddess ofhigher power even than thegods
Ku,Kane, orKanaloa. Shewasthegreat dragon-goddess
oftheHawaiians, coming totheislands inthemigration
ofthegodsfrom Nuu-mea-lani andKuai-he-lani tosettle.
Thedragons andother kupuas came asspirit servants ofthe
gods.
Forawhile thisMo-o-inanea lived with herbrothers,
thegods, atWaolani, but after alongtime there were so
many dragons that itwasnecessary todistribute them over
theislands, andMo-o-inanea decided toleave herbrothers
andfindhomes forhernumerous family. Soshewentdown


THEDRAGON GHOST-GODS 257
toPuunui inthelower part ofNuuanu Valley and there
made herhome, and itissaidreceived worsUp from the
men oftheancient days. Here shedwelt inherdualnature—
sometimes appearing asadragon, sometimes asawoman.
Very richclayey soilwasfound inthisplace, forced out
oftheearth asifbygeyser action. Itwasgreatly sought in
later yearsbythechiefswhoworshipped thisgoddess. They
made theplace tabu,andused theclay,sometimes eating it,
butgenerally plastering thehairwith it.Thisplacewasmade
verytabubythelateQueen Kaahumanu during herlifetime.
Mo-o-inanea lived inthepitfrom which this claywas
procured, aplace called Lua-palolo, meaning pit-of-sticky-
clay. After shehadcome tothisdwelling-place thedragons
were sentouttofindhomes. Somebecame chiefs andothers
servants, andwhenbythemselves wereknown asthe evil
ones. Shedistributed herfamily overaUtheislands from
Hawaii toNiihau. Two ofthese dragon-women, according
tothelegends, Uved asguardians ofthepali(precipice) atthe
endofNuuanu Valley, above Honolulu. Aftermany years
itwassupposed thattheybothassumed thepermanent forms
oflarge stones which have never lost their associations with
mysterious, miraculous power.
Even aslateas1825, Mr.Bloxam, thechaplain ofthe
English man-of-war, recorded in"TheVoyage oftheBlonde"
thefollowing statement:
"At thebottom oftheParre (pali) there aretwo large
stones onwhich evennow offerings offruits andflowers are
laid topropitiate theAku-wahines, orgoddesses, who are
supposed tohave thepower ofgranting asafepassage."
Mr.Bloxam saysthatthese wereakind ofmo-o, orreptile,
goddesses, andadds that itwas difficult toexplain themean-
ingofthename given tothem, probably because theHawaiians
hadnothing intheshape ofserpents orlarge reptiles intheir
islands.
Anative account ofthese stones says: "There isalarge
grove ofhau-trees inNuuanu Valley, andabove these lie
thetwoforest women, Hau-ola andHa-puu. These arenow
two large stones, onebeing about three feetlongwithafine
smooth back, theother round withsome little rough places.
Thelong stone isontheseaward side,and this istheMo-o
woman, Hau-ola; and theother, Ha-puu. The leaves of
ferns cover Hau-ola, being laidonthat stone. Ontheother
stone, Ha-puu, arelehua flowers. These arekupuas."


258 APPENDIX
Again theoldpeople said that their ancestors hadbeen
accustomed tobring thenavel cords oftheir children andbury
them under these stones toinsure protection ofthelittle ones
from evil,andthatthese werethestonewomen ofNuuanu.
Ala-muki lived inthedeep pools oftheWaialua River
near theplace Ka-mo-o-loa, which received itsname from the
longjourneys thatdragon made over theplains ofWaialua.
Sheandherdescendants guarded thepaths andsometimes
destroyed thosewho travelled thatway.
Onedragon lived intheEwa lagoon, nowknown asPearl
Harbor. This wasKane-kua-ana, whowas said tohave
brought thepipi (oysters) toEwa. Shewasworshipped by
thosewhogathered the shell-fish. When theoysters began
todisappear about 1850, thenatives saidthat thedragon
hadbecome angry andwassending theoysters toKahiki, or
some far-away foreign land.
Kilioe, Koe,andMilolii were noted dragons ontheisland
ofKauai. They were thedragons oftheprecipices ofthe
northern coast ofthis island, whotook thebody ofthehigh
chiefLohiau andconcealed itinacave farupthesteep side
ofthemountain. There isavery long interesting story of
thelovebetween Lohiau and Pele, thegoddess offire. In
thisstory Peleovercame thedragons andwon thelove of
the chief. Hiiaka, the sister ofthe fire-goddess, wona
second victory overthemwhen sherescued abodyfrom the
caveandbrought itback tolife.
OnMaui, thegreatest dragon oftheisland wasKiha-
wahine. Thenatives hadthesaying, "Kiha hasmana, or
miraculous power, likeMo-o-inanea." Shelived inalarge
deep poolontheedge ofthevillage Lahaina, andwaswor-
shipped bytheroyal family ofMaui astheir special guardian.
There weremany dragons oftheisland ofHawaii, andthe
mostnoted ofthese were thetwowho lived intheWailuku
River near Hilo. They were called "themoving boards"
whichmade abridge across theriver.
Sometimes they accepted offerings andpermitted asafe
passage, andsometimes theytipped thepassengers intothe
water anddrowned them. They were destroyed byHiiaka.
Sacred tothese dragons whowere scattered over allthe
islands were themo-o priests andthesorcerers, who propi-
tiated them with offerings andsacrifices, chanting incantations.

Mr.Westervelt haslongbeenanactive investigator of
theaboriginal conditions ofHawaiian life,andthestories he
hasdiscovered haveadded notalittle toourknowledge of
thePolynesian race asitwasbefore thedawn ofhistory.
Theancient Hawaiians were ofanimaginative turn ofmind,
and their traditions abound intales ofgodsand goblins.
Some ofthe stories, now centuries old,areclosely related
tothelegends that areknown toexist inNewZealand and
other islands ofthePacific, andmany ofthem bear active
resemblances tothefairy-tales ofourowncountry. They
areinteresting enough inthemselves, andhaveanadded
attraction forthestudent ofcomparative folk-lore. The
present volume contains excellent illustrations ofthescenery
ofHonolidu, some ofthem taken from photographs bythe
author.—

The character ofthelegends varies. One ortwo,and
these perhaps themost interesting, areCreation myths.

Kamapuaa wasrather aglorious ruffian andcapable ofsur-
prising transformations.
"Many oftheHawaiians [hewrites] ofto-day believe
inthecontinual presence oftheaumakuas, thespirits ofthe
dead. Intimepast theaumakuas were apowerful reality.
Anancester, afather oragrandfather, amakua, died. Some-
times hewent toPo,theunderworld, ortoMilu, theshadow-
land, ortoLani, theHawaiian heaven, andsometimes he
remained tobeatorment orablessing tohispast friends."

Honolulu isfastbecoming afavorite tourist land, and
particularly since thetremendous popularity ofarecent
Hawaiian volcano play, agoodmany people have taken to
humming pensively thenative farewell songanddiscoursing
wistfully oftheEden-like qualities oftheislands. Inview
ofthisincreasing interest, W.D.Westervelt's book ofthe
legends ofHonolulu isespecially timely, although sucha
work always hasvalue. During hisresidence inHonolulu
thiswriter hascollected andtranslated from theHawaiian
alltheavailable legends oftheregion, retelling them with
singular success.
Tomention butaninstance, every oneofthem hasatale
relating thecreation ofman. This haunting similarity is
oneofthefascinations oflegend study. Mr.Westervelt has
made anoteworthy contribution tothatbranch ofliterature.—

These legends willprove ofunusual interest tothegeneral
reader andespecially tothescholar, thinker, andpoet. They
describe vividly andstrongly thetriumphs andthewander-
ings ofthepeople ofHawaii. Thelegends ofoldHonolulu

"Legends ofOldHonolulu" isaninteresting summary of
what isknown about theHawaiian Islands, their people,
andtheorigin oftheir race.
Assoon astheHawaiian alphabet wasprepared, in1821,
native writers began delving into their past, finding there a
treasure-mine ofromantic stories andofvaluable ethnological
andhistorical facts inregard tothePols^iesian race. These
stories were written originally inHawaiian, fornative news-
papers, andhavebeen collected andtranslated byMr.W.D.
Westervelt, author ofprevious volumes onthissame subject.
While thebook willbeofspecial interest tostudents of
ethnology and tothose who have visited Honolulu, the
romantic charm which pervades this Pacific archipelago
gives itshistory auniversal attraction forthereading public.
