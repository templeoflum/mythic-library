senger answered, "Theday after to-morrow they
will arrive here/' Then Maru-tnahu gave orders,
saying, "To-morrow letthe feast beranged in
rows, sothatwhen they arrive heretheymay find
itallready forthem/' Upon thisthey allretired
torest,andwhen thedawn appeared theyarranged
thefood tobegiven tothestrangers inrows :the

butunder thesewasplaced nothing butrotten wood
and filth, although theexterior made averygoodly
show. Heintended this feast tobeafeast at
which thosewhocame asguests should beslaugh-
tered, inrevenge forthecurse against Hotunui,
which hadexceedingly pained hisheart.
Soon after daybreak thenext morning the
guests came, and seeing the piles ofprovisions
which were laid out forthem, they were ex-
ceedingly rejoiced, and longed forthetime of
their distribution, andwhen they might touch
this food, little thinking how dearly they were
topay for it.The guests had allarrived and
taken their seatsupon thegrass,when Marutuahu
and hispeople came together;—they were only
onehundred and forty.
Astheywere tostretch thegreat netmade up

bemore easily stretched ;andwhen themorning-
dawned thosewhohadcome forthepurpose began
todraw outthenet, stretching theropeandthe
bottom ofthenetalong theground, andpegging it
tightdown from corner tocorner, andthus whilst
Maru-tuahu's people were preparing food forthem
toeat,theothers worked away atstretching the

Maru-tuahu sentaman toseewhether theyhad
finished stretching the net,andwhen theman
came back, hesaid, "Have theydone stretching the
net?" and theman answered, "Yes, they have
finished.'' Then Maru-tuahu said, "Letusgoand
lifttheupper endofthenetfrom theground;—they
have finished thelower endof it.''Then theone
hundred and fortymenwent with him, each one
carrying aweapon, carefully concealed under his
garments, lest their guests should seethem;and
when they reached theplace where thenetwas,
theyfound theguests, nearly athousand innum-
ber,had finished stretching thelower endofthe
net. Then thepriest ofMaru-tuahu whowas to
consecrate thenetsaid, "Lettheupper endofthe

Then theonehundred and fortymen began to
liftupthe net,with the lefthand they seized
theropes toraise it,butwith theright hand
each firmly grasped hisweapon, andMaru-tuahu
shouted out, "Liftaway, hftaway, lift itwell

theywalked onwith it ;holding itupasifthey
were spreading itout, until they got itwell over
thestrangers, whowere either pegging thelower
enddown, orwere seated ontheground looking
on;thenMaru-tuahu shouted out, "Let itfall;"
andthey let itfall,andcaught inittheir guests,
nearly athousand innumber ;theycaught every
one ofthem inthe net, sothat they could not
move tomake any effectual resistance, andwhilst
some oftheonehundred and fortymen ofMaru-
tuahu held thenetdown, therest sleAvwith their
weapons thewhole thousand, notoneescaped, whilst

"The feast ofrotten wood" isaproverb amongst
thedescendants ofMaru-tuahu tothisday. This
feast ofrotten wood wasgiven ataplace which
wasthennamed Pukeahau, butwhich was after-
wards called Karihitangata (or,men w^ere the

people, thecountry they inhabited became thepro-

About thetime thatTeKahureremoa, Paka's
daughter, became marriageable, alarge party of
visitors arrived atWharekawa, thevillage ofTe
Paka ;theycame from Aotea, ortheGreat Barrier
Island ;attheir head was the principal chief
ofAotea, andhebrought inhiscanoes apresent of
twohundred andsixty baskets ofmackerel forTe
Paka, andtheybecame suchgood friends, thatthey
thought theywould like tobeconnected ;soit
wasarranged thatTePaka's daughter, TeKahu-
reremoa, should begiven asawife tothesonof
that chief; part ofTePaka's planwas toget
possession ofAotea forhisfamily, forhethought
when hisdaughter had children, andthey were
grown up,that itwas possible theywould secure
theisland fortheir grandfather, orfortheir mother's
family.
When theparty ofvisitors wasabout toreturn

hetold hisdaughter togoonboard thecanoe, and
