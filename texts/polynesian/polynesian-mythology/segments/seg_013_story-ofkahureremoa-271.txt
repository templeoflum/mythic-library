THETWOSOECERERS,
(kOTEMATENGA KIKI.)
KiKl wasacelebrated sorcerer, and skilled in
magical arts ;lielived upon the river Waikato.
Theinhabitants ofthat river stillhave thisproverb,
"Theoffspring ofKiki v^rither shrubs/' This pro-
verbhad itsorigin inthecircumstance ofKiki
being suchamagician, thathecould notgoabroad
inthesunshine;forifhisshadow fellupon any
place notprotected from hismagic, itatonce be-
came tapu, and alltheplants there withered.
This Kikiwasthoroughly skilled intheprac-
tice ofsorcery. Ifany parties coming upthe
river called athisvillage intheir canoes asthey
paddled by,he stillremained quietly athome,
and never troubled himself tocome out,but
justdrew back the sliding door ofhishouse,
sothat itmight stand open, and thestrangers

dlingdown from theupper parts oftheriver, he

dow ofhishouse, andthecrews onboard ofthem
were sure todie.
Atlength, thefame ofthis sorcerer spread ex-
ceedingly, andresounded through every tribe, until
Tamure, achiefwho dwelt atKawhia, heard with
others, reports ofthemagical powers ofKiki, for
hisfame extended over theAvhole country. At
length Tamure thought hewould goandcontend
intheartsofsorcery with Kiki, that itmight be
seen Avhich ofthemwasmost skilled inmagic ;and
hearranged inhisownmind afortunate season for
hisvisit.
When thistime came, heselected two ofhis
people ashiscompanions, andhetook hisyoung
daughter withhim also;andthey allcrossed over
themountain range from Kawhia, andcamedown
upon theriverWaipa, which runs into theWai-
kato, andembarking there inacanoe, paddled
down theriver towards thevillage ofKiki ;and
theymanaged sowell, that before theywere seen
byanybody, theyhadarrived atthelanding-place.
Tamure was notonly skilled inmagic, buthe
was also avery cautious man ;sowhilst they
were still afloat upon the river, herepeated anin-
cantation ofthekind called "Mata-tawhito,'' to
preserve him safefrom allartsofsorcery;andhe
repeated other incantations, toward offspells, to
pr(^tect himfrom magic, tocollect good geniiround

hiiHj tokeep offevil spirits, andtosliielcl himfrom
demons;when these preparations were allfinished,
they landed, anddrewuptheir canoe onthebeach,
atthelanding-place ofKiki.
Assoon astheyhad landed, theoldsorcerer
called outtothem that theywerewelcome tohis
village, andinvited them tocomeuptoit;sothey
went uptothevillage :andwhen they reached
thesquare inthe centre, they seated themselves
upon theground ;andsome ofKiki's people
kindled fireinanenchanted oven, andbegan to
cook food initforthestrangers. Kiki satinhis
house, andTamure ontheground just outside the
entrance to it,andhethere availed himself of
thisopportunity torepeat incantations over the
threshold ofthehouse, sothatKikimight been-
chanted ashestepped over ittocome out.When
thefood intheenchanted ovenwas cooked, they
pulled offthecoverings, andspread itoutupon
clean mats. The oldsorcerer nowmade hisap-
pearance outofhishouse, andheinvited Tamure
tocome and eatfood with him ;but thefood
was allenchanted, and hisobject inasking Ta-
mure toeatwithhimwas, that theenchanted
foodmight killhim;therefore Tamure saidthat his
young daughter wasvery hungiy, andwould eat
ofthefood offered tothem;heinthemeantime
kept onrepeating incantations ofthekind called


276 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
Mata-tawhito, Whakangungu, andParepare^ protec-
tions against enchanted food, and assheateshe
also continued torepeat them ;evenwhen she
stretched outherhand totakeasweet potato, or
anyother food, shedropped thegreater part ofit
ather feet,andhid itunder her clothes, andthen
only atealittle bit. After shehad done, the
old sorcerer, Kiki, kept waiting forTamure to
begin toeat also oftheenchanted food, that
hemight soon die. Kiki having gone into his
house again, Tamure still satontheground out-
side the door, and ashehad enchanted the
threshold ofthehouse, henow repeated incan-
tations which might render thedoor enchanted
also, sothatKiki might becertain nottoescape
when hepassed outofitBythistimeTamure's
daughter hadquite finished hermeal, butneither
herfather noreither ofhispeople hadpartaken of
theenchanted food.
Tamure now ordered hispeople tolaunch his
canoe, andthey paddled away, andalittle time
after they had leftthe village, Kiki became un-
well;inthemeanwhile, Tamure and hispeople
were paddling homewards inallhaste, and as
they passed avillage where there were agood
many people onthe river's bank, Tamure stopped,
and said tothem, "Ifyoushould seeanycanoe
puUino- after us,and thepeople inthecanoe ask

farhas itgot?' would youbegoodenough tosay,
'Oh,bythistime ithasgotvery farupthe
riverV"andhaving thus said tothepeople of
that village, Tamure paddled away again inhis
canoe with allhaste.
Some time after Tamure's party had leftthe
village ofKiki, theoldsorcerer became very ill
indeed, and hispeople thenknew that thishad
beenbrought about bythemagical artsofTamure,
andthey sprang intoacanoe tofollow after him,
andpulled uptheriver ashard asthey could; and
when they reached thevillage where thepeople
wereontheriver's bank, they called outandasked
them, "How farhas thecanoe reached, which
passed uptheriverVandthevillagers answered,
"Oh,that canoe must have gotvery farupthe
riverbythis time.'' Thepeople inthecanoe that
waspursuing Tamure, upon liearing this, returned
again totheirown village, andKiki diedfrom the
incantations ofTamure.
Some ofKiki's descendants are still living—
oneofthem,named Mokahi, recently died atTau-
ranga-a-Ruru, butTeMaioha isstill living onthe
river Waipa. Yes, some ofthedescendants of
Kiki, whose shadow withered trees, are still living.

THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD,
(kongapumiapuarata eaua kotautohito.)
This head bewitched allpersons whoapproached
the hillwhere the fortress inwhich itwaskept
was situated, sothat, from fear of it,nohuman
being dared toapproach theplace, which wasthence
named theSacred Mount.
Upon thatmount dwelt Puarata andTautohito
with their carved head, and itsfamewent through
allthecountry, totheriver Tamaki, and toKai-
para,and tothe tribes ofNgapuhi, toAkau, to
Waikato, toKawhia, toMokau, toHauraki, and
toTauranga ;theexceeding great fame ofthe
powers ofthat carved head spread toevery part
ofAotea-roa, orthenorthern island ofNew Zea-
land;everywhere reports were heard, that sogreat
were itsmagical powers, none could escape alive
fromthem;andalthough many warriors andarmies
went totheSacred Mount totrytodestroy the
sorcerers towhom thehead belonged, andtocarry
itoffasagenius fortheirown district, that its

magical powers might besubservient tothem,
they allperished intheattempt. Inshort, no
mortal could approach the fortress, and live;
even parties ofpeople whowere travelling along
theforest track, tothenorthwards towards Muri-
whenua, alldiedbythemagical powers ofthat
head ;Avhether theywent inlargearmed bodies, or
simply asquiet travellers, their fatewasalike—they
allperished, from itsmagical influence, somewhere
about theplacewhere thebeaten track passes over
Waimatuku.
Thedeaths ofsomany persons created agreat
sensation inthecountry, and, atlast, thereport of
these things reached averypowerful sorcerer named
Hakawau, who, confiding inhismagical arts, said
hewasresolved togoandseethismagic head, and
thesorcerers whoowned it.So,without delay, he
called upon allthegeniiwhowere subservient to
him, inorder that hemight bethrown intoan
enchanted sleep,andseewhat hisfateinthisunder-
taking would be ;and inhisslumber hesawthat
hisgenius would triumph intheencounter, for it
was soloftyandmighty, that inhisdream itshead
reached theheavens, whilst itsfeetremained upon
earth.
Having byhisspells ascertained this,heatonce
started onhisjourney, and the district through
which hetravelled wasthatofAkau;and,confiding


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 281
inhisownenchantments, hewent fearlessly totry
v/hether hisartsofsorcery would notprevail over
themagic head, andenable him todestroy theold
sorcerer Puarata.
Hetookwithhimone friend, andwent along
thesea-coast towards theSacred Mount, andpassed
through Whanga-roa, andfollowed the sea-shore
toBangikahu andKuhawera, andcame outupon
thecoast again atKaroroumanui, and arrived
atMaraetai ;there was afortified village, the
people ofwhich endeavoured todetain Hakawau
and hisfriend until they rested themselves and
partook ofalittle food;buthesaid, "Weatefood
ontheroad, ashort distance behind us;weare
notatallhungry orweary/' Sotheywould not
remain atMaraetai, butwent straight onuntil
they reached Putataka, andthey crossed theriver
there, andproceeded along thebeach toRukuwai;
neither didthey stop there, butonthey went,
and atlastreached Waitara.
When they gottoWaitara, thefriend who ac-
companied Hakawau began togetalarmed, and
said,"Now we shall perish here, Ifear;'' but
theywent safely on,andreached TeWeta ;there

safety, andonthey went, and atlength they
reached themost fatal place ofall—Wainiatuku.
Here they smelt thestench ofthecarcases ofthe
numbers whohadbeen previously destroyed ;indeed
thestench was sobadthat itwasquite suffocating,
andthey bothnow said, "This isafearful place;
wefearweshall perish here/' However, Haka-
wau keptonunceasingly working athisenchant-
ments, and repeating incantations, which might
ward offtheattacks ofevil genii, andwhich might
collect good genii about them, toprotect them from
themalignant spirits ofPuarata, lestthese should
injure them;thus they passed overWaimatuku,
looking with horror atthemany corpses strewed
about thebeach, andinthedense fernandbushes
which bordered thepath;andastheypursued their
onward journey, they expected death every mo-
ment.
Nevertheless they diednotonthedreadful road,
butwent straight along thepath tilltheycame to
theplace where itpasses oversome low hills,from
whence theycould seethefortress which stood upon
theSacred Mount. Here they satdown and
rested, forthe firsttime since theyhadcommenced
their journey. They hadnotyetbeen seenbythe
watchmen ofthe fortress. Then Hakawau, with
liisincantations, sent forthmany genii, toattack


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 283
the spirits who keptwatch over thefortress and
magic head ofPuarata. Some ofhisgood genii
were sentbyHakawau inadvance, whilst he
charged others tofollow atsome distance. The
incantations bythepower ofwhich these geniiwere
sentforthbyHakawau wasaWhangai. The genii
hesent infront were ordered immediately tobegin
the assault. Assoon asthe spirits whoguarded
the fortress ofPuarata saw the others, they all
issued outtoattack them;thegood genii then
feigned aretreat, the evil ones following them,
andwhilst they were thus engaged inthepur-
suit,some ofthethousands ofgood genii, who
had lastbeen sent forth byHakawau, stormed
thefortress now leftwithout defenders ;when the
evil spirits, whohadbeen ledaway inthepursuit,
turned toprotect the fortress, theyfound thatthe
genii ofHakawau hadalready gotquite close toit,
andthegood genii ofHakawau without trouble
caught them one after theother, andthus allthe
spirits oftheoldsorcerer Puarata were utterly
destroyed.
When allthe evil spirits whohadbeen subject
totheoldsorcerer hadbeen thus destroyed, Haka-
w^auwalked straight uptowards the fortress of
this fellow, inwhom spirits haddwelt asthick as
menstow themselves inacanoe, andwhom they

hadused inlikemanner tocanythem about. When
thewatchmen ofthe fortress, totheir great sur-
prise, sawstrangers coming, Puarata hurried tohis
magic head, tocallupon it;hissupplication was
after thismanner—"Strangers come here Istrangers
come here !Two strano-ers come 1two strano^ers
come!''But ituttered only alowwailing sound;
forsince thegood genii ofHakawau haddestro3^ed
the spirits who served Puarata, theoldsorcerer
addressed invain hissupplications tothemagic
head, itcould nolonger raise aloud itspowerful
voice asinformer times, bututtered onlylowmoans
andwails. Could ithave cried outwith aloud
voice, straightway Hakawau and hisfriend would
bothhave perished ;forthus itwas,when armies
and travellers had inother times passed the for-
tress, Puarata addressed supplications tohismagic
head, andwhen itcried outwith amighty voice,
thestrangers allperished astheyheard it.
Hakawau and hisfriend had, inthemeantime,
continued towalk straight tothe fortress. When
theydrew near it,Hakawau said tohisfriend,
"Yougodirectly along thepath that leadsby
thegateway into the fortress; asforme, Iwill
showmypower over theoldsorcerer, byclimbing
right over theparapet and palisades:'' andwhen
they reached the defences ofthe place, Haka-

wau began toclimb over thepalisades ofthe
gateway. When thepeople oftheplacesaw this,
theyweremuch exasperated, anddesired him, in
anangry manner, topassunderneath thegateway,
along thepathway which wascommon toall,and
nottodare toclimb overthegateway ofPuarata and
ofTautohito; butHakawau went quietly onover
thegateway, without paying theleast attention to
theangry words ofthosewhowere calling outto
him, forhefeltquite surethat thetwooldsorcerers
were not soskilful inmagical arts ashewas;so
Hakawau persisted ingoing direct toallthemost
holy places ofthefortress, where noperson whohad
notbeenmade sacred might enter.
AfterHakawau and hisfriend hadbeen fora
short time inthe fortress, andhad rested them-
selves alittle, thepeople oftheplace began tocook
food forthem; they stillcontinued tositresting
themselves inthe fortress foralong time, and at
length Hakawau said tohisfriend, "Letusde-
part.'' Directly hisservant heard what hismaster
said tohim,hejumped upatonceandwasready
enough tobe off.Then thepeople oftheplace
called outtothem nottogoimmediately, butto
takesome food first ;butHakawau answered, "Oh,
weateonlyalittle while ago;not farfrom here
wetooksome food.'' SoHakawau would notre-
main longer inthefortress, butdeparted, and as

hestarted, besmote hishands onthethreshold of
thehouse inwhich theyhad rested, andtheyhad
hardly got Avell outside ofthefortress before every

Once "upon atime, aman ofthename ofKahu-

very striking totell allhisfriends inevery direc-

something new.
Sothat night hereturned totheplace where

the fairies, asanencouragement intheir work, and
from thejoyoftheir hearts attheir sport in
fishing.

Foralongtime thevoices grew louder andmore

theycame quite close tothe fire;TeKanawa
and hisparty were halfdeadwith fright. Atlast
the fairies approached tolook atTeKanawa, who
was averyhandsome fellow. Todothis, they
kept peeping slilyover thelarge roots ofthetree

wasonly trying toamuse and please them tosave

taken offhisneck ornament, andpulled outhis
jasper ear-ring, and hisother ear-ring, made ofa
tooth ofthetiger-shark, hespread them outbefore
the fairies, and offered them tothemultitude

thinking itbetter thefairies should nottouch him,

thepaofRangirarunga, and thearmy invested
that fortress, and satbefore itnight andday,yet
theycould nottake it ;theycontinued nevertheless
constantly tomake assaults upon it,andtoattack
thegarrison ofthefortress, sothat itsinhabitants
became worn outfromwant ofprovisions and
water, andmany ofthem were near dying.
Atlasttheoldchief ofthepa,Rangirarunga,
overcome bythirst, stood onthetopofthede-
fences ofthe pa,and cried outtothemen ofthe
enemy's army, "Iprayyou togivemeonedrop

man, said, "Yes;'' andoneranwith acalabash
togivehimwater. But themajority being more
hard-hearted, were angry atthis,andbroke the
calabash inhishands, sothatnotadrop ofwater
reached thepoor oldman;and thiswasdone se-
veral times, whilst hisenemies continued disputing
amongst themselves.
The old chief still stood onthetopofthe

thewarriors ofthearmy ofTakarangi looked on,

There wasformerly alarge fortified town upon
Mount Eden; itsdefences were massive andstrong,
andagreatnumber ofpersons inhabited thetown.
Inthedays ofolden time awarwascommenced
bythetribes ofAwhitu andofWaikato, against the
people who inhabited thetown atMount Eden or
Maunga-whau.
There they engaged inafierce war :one side
first persisted intheir efforts forvictory, until they
were successful inbeating theother party ;then the
other sideintheir turn succeeded inresisting their
enemies, andgained avictory intheir turn;thus
the tribes ofWaikato didnotsucceed indestroy-
ingtheir enemies asthey desired.
After this thepeople ofWaikato thought, fora
long time, "Well, what hadwebetter donow
todestroy these enemies ofours?''' And seeing no
way toaccomplish this,theydetermined tomake

peace withthem;so,atlast,theyarranged apeace,
and itappeared tobeasure one.
When thispeace hadbeen made, TePonga, a
chief from Awhitu, andone ofthe fiercest ene-
mies ofthepeople ofthattown, went, attended by
alarge company, toMaunga-whau, andwhilst he
wasyetalongway off,heand hisparty were seen
coming along bythepeople ofthe fortified town,
andthey rantothegates ofthefortress, calling
out, "Welcome, oh,welcome, strangers from afar!''
andtheywaved their garments tothem ;and the
strangers, encouraged bythese cries, came straight
ontothetown until they reached it,andthen
walked direct tothelarge court-yard infront of
thehouse ofthechief ofthetown, andthere thev
allseated themselves.
The inhabitants being allnow assembled in
thetown, aswell asthe strangers, the chiefs of
each party stood upandmade speeches, andwhen
theyhadconcluded thispart oftheceremony, the
women lighted fires tocook food fortliestrangers,
andwhen theovens were heated, they put the
food inandcovered them up. Inavery short

The strangers, however, atevery slowly, know-

Then thedancers began, andwhilst theysprang

Then, just astheywere allbeating time toge-

come, and forth shesprang before theassembled
dancers;first shebends herheadwithmany ges-
tures towards thepeople upon theone side,and
then towards those upon the other, asshe per-
formed herpart beautifully; her fullorbed eyes
seemed clearand brilliant asthe fullmoon rising
inthehorizon, andwhilst thestrangers looked at
theyoung girl,they allwere quite overpowered with
herbeauty;andTePonga, theiryoung chief, felt
hisheart grow wild with emotion, when hesaw so
much loveliness before him. Inthemeanwhile the
people ofthevillage went ondancing, until allthe
evolutions ofthedance were duly completed, when
they paused.
Thenupsprang thestrangers todance intheir
turn, andthey duly ranged themselves inorder,
rank behind rank ofthedancers, andbegan with
their hands tobeat time, and whilst they thus
gave thetime ofthemeasure, theyoung chief,
TePonga, stood peeping overthemandwaiting a

the village were sosurprised athisagility and

and asfortheyoung girlPuhihuia, herheart con-
ceived awarm passion forTePonga.
Atlength thedance concluded, and alldis-
persed, each totheplace where hewas torest;
then, overcome with weariness, they allreclined

Ah !youwillnothearwhen youdonot like,but

Thus the slave advised hismaster, andthey
arranged fully theplan oftheir proceedings;the
next dayTePonga went tovisit the chief of
the village, and satinhishouse watching the
young girl,and before longevening closed in,and
they retired torest,andsome time afterwards Te
Ponga, pretending tobethirsty, called outloudly
tothis slave, "Halloa !sir,fetchmesome water ;"
butnotaword didtheslave answer him;and
TePonga continued tocallout tohim louder
and louder, until atlastheseemed tobecome
weary ofshouting. When thechief ofthevillage
heard him calling outinthisway forwater, heat

arose, and, taking acalabash, went offtofetch
water;andnosooner didTePonga seeher start-
incroffthan hetoo arose, andwent outofthe
house, feigning byhisvoice andwords tobevery
angry with hisslave, sothat allmight think he

When themaiden arrived atthebrink ofthe

sheheard some onebehind her,and,turning sud-

byher side,andthey conversed together, and to
each ofthem thewords oftheother seemed most
pleasant andengaging. Why needmore besaid ?
Before they separated they arranged atimewhen
theymight escape together, andthen each ofthem
returned tothevillage towait fortheoccasion they
had agi'eed upon.
When theappointed timehadarrived, hedesired
some chosen men ofhisfollowers togototheland-

further directed them togoround every oneofthe
other canoes, tocutthelashings which made the
topsides fast tothe hulls, and topull out all
the plugs, sothat those following them might be
checked andthrown into confusion atfinding they
hadnocanoes inwhich tocontinue the jDursuit.
Those ofhispeople towhom TePonga gave these
orders immediately departed, and didexactly as
their chiefhaddirected them.
Thenextmorning TePonga having toldhishost

andwhen theyhad allcollected, thechief ofthe
fortress stood up,and, after asuitable speech, pre-
sented hisjademere toTePonga asaparting gift,
which might establish andmake sure thepeace
which theyhadconcluded. TePonga inhisturn
presented with thesame ceremonies hisjademere

accompanied them tothegates ofthefortress to

Just before thestrangers had started, Puhihuia

Itmaynotbeamiss, before going further into this
analogy ofnature, andofanartreciprocally reflecting
back that nature, toendeavour togivetheuninitiated an
idea ofwhat ismeant bythe"enharmonic genus" ofthe
Greeks.
Imust firstremark thatwhilewehave, properly speak-
ing,onlyonescale ofmusical notes andtwogenera, the
Greeks hadthree scales and fivegenera. Forwehave
onlythediatonic scale, butbyacertain introduction ofone
ormore semitones, wemake what iscalled thechromatic.
Whereas, theGreeks hadthree scales, comprising five
genera, or,according tosome, nine* alldiffering notonly,
asours do,intheposition ofintervals, butintheintervals
themselves ;this difference ofinterval (rather than posi-

tionofinterval) gave rise totheexpression "genera ofa
system,'' anddepended onthedistribution oftwointerme-
diate sounds inthetetrachord or4th.
The principal scales andgenera were three; the dia-
tonic, thechromatic, andtheenharmonic. The diatonic
(genus) consisted ofalimma orminor half tone, amajor
tone,andamajor tone ascending, thishadanother modi-
fication, bjwhich, while itretained thesame semitone, it
contracted thenext tone,andextended thelast; thelatter
wascalled softdiatonic.
The chromatic, which consisted ofsemitone, semitone,
onetoneandahalf interval, ornearly ourminor third,
was called tonaoson, andhadtwo modifications, one
called hemiolion, andtheother malakon ;these shades or
modifications seem oflater invention, andsoon tohave
fallen into disuse.
Theenharmonic consisted ofaquarter tone, aquarter
toneandaninterval oftwotones, aninterval somewhat
greater than ourthird major.
Wallis says thatwehave noidea ofthese intervals at
thepresent day, asinanywayconnected with ascale, since
theyamount tolittlemore thananimperfect elevation or
depression ofthevoice within thelimits ofwhatwecalla
sound orharmonic note ;though acertain use ismade of
theterm enharmonic, andtheexistence oftheinterval is
admitted inthehigher researches onmusic, andsaid tobe
apparent intheso-called tierce wolf oftheorgan, inun-
tempered instruments, andinthesystems ofequal tem-
perament.
Writers ofthepresent daygreatly differ astotheex-

tointroduce;* others again fdeclaring them tobeinprac-
ticeimpossible ;and allforthemost part alleging that,
whatever might have been thecase informer times, no
such modifications doexist inpractice atthepresent day.
Now, with regard totheexistence ofthem inancient
times, innumerable authorities might bequoted;but,notto
exceed areasonable limit, Ishall only citeoneortwo tes.-
timonies, andshall confine myself tothose referring to
theenharmonic.
Vitruvlus (lib. v.c.5)says :*'Diatoni veroquod naturalis

cepta, etearecantio ejusmaxime gravem etegregiam habet

Wemayhere incidentally remark, thatthough hesays,
"aharte concept a," itdoes notprove that itmight not
havebeen artimitating nature ;andmore, itisnotimpos-
sible that these, atpresent so-called uncivilised andsavage
nations, might have retained thischaracter ofsongfrom a
period ofthehighest state ofcivilisation, atanepoch of
great antiquity.
Plutarch (Oe^I Mova-iy.^q) remarks, thatthemost beautiful
ofthemusical genera istheenharmonic, onaccount ofits
grave andsolemn character, and that itwasformerly
most inesteem.
Aristides Quintilian tellsusitwasthemost difficult of

theirjudgment could appreciate, awant ofexactness in

selfhasbeen inthemost crowded theatre, where, ifa
singer orcitharoedist mistook thesmallest interval (pre-sumed tobetheenharmonic diesis), hewashissed offthe

Isaac Vossiiis,^ from amultitude ofauthorities, has
established, that transitions weremade byancient singersandperformers, from thediatonic tothechromatic andenharmonic, withthegreatest facility;andheadds,"which,

ancients could notaccompany theenharmonic) forget that
iftheycanaccompany greater intervals which were com-posed ofless, there canbenoreason whythescale ofaninstrument might notbesoadjusted astoaccompany the
lessintervals which compose those greater.
Thedoubt ofthepossibility ofusing theenharmonic asascale isnotconfined toourown day,forPlutarch, aswehave seen (and inother places also), speaks ofthedecline
ofIt;andAthenj£us speaks ofcertain Greeks who, from
time totime, retired bythemselves tokeepuptherecol-

Forwhatever reason, itappears itwaswholly laidaside in

Wallis supposes thegenera ofthechromatic andenhar-

neither voice could execute, noreareasily distinguish so

Dr.Burney (i.433), inhisHistory ofMusic, from vari-

that letter thattheArabian scale ofmusic wasdivided into
quarter tones; andthatanoctave, which, upon ourkeyed
instruments isonly divided into12semitones, intheAra-
bian scale contained 24.,forallofivhich theyhadparticular
denomhiations.''
This latter observation would seem totally very well
withwhat Mr.Lane* says ofthecanoon (xav^v) ofthe
present Arabs, which, hesays, has24treble notes. Only,
thatheadds, eachnotehasthree strings toit,which (later,
asweshall see)heaffirms tohavebeen thirds oftones. If
so,thesystem isashade ofthechromatic ;and ifMr.
Lane isright (andhegives adrawing oftheinstrument),
Dr.Russell must err,orspeak ofanother instrument. I
should beinclined togive preference toLane, because of
thegreat pains hehastaken indescribing theinstrument.

says, that'*itisimpossible toobtain theintervals oftheir
scaleonourkeyed instruments, buttheymaybeperfectly
effected ontheviolin."
Mr.Vincent* gives amost scientific description ofan
elaborate instrument made atParis, exhibited attheIn-
stitut, onwhich thequarter tones were most correctly
illustrated, andobserves, that amuch less interval than
thequarter-tone, perhaps eight ortentimes less, isdis-
cernible, asproved byaM.Delezenne,f 1827; andour
own ears attest thatuniversally inthemodulations ofthe
voice oftheso-called savage tribes, andintherefined and
anomalously-studied Chinese, there areintervals which do
notcorrespond toanynotes onourkeyed instruments, and
which toanuntrained earappear almost monotonous.
There isanother matter withwhich incidentally wehave
todo,namely, anapparent difference ofopinion between
ancient authors themselves about theenharmonic. Plu-
tarchtsays thatAristoxenus (inabook notnowextant)
informs usthatOlympus wastheinventor ofanenhar-
monic, butofakind consisting ofascale inwhich certain
notes, the"lichani" or"indicatrices," were omitted, and
that the airs ofOlympus were sosimple and beautiful,
that there wasnothing likethem.

This Scale would approximate totheScotch, orrather
tothatgiven asChinese byDr.Russell. §
Butthere isnothing repugnant inthis, tothedivision
oftheintermediate half-note between thissaltus ;and, as

Suffice ittosay, thatmany Chinese airs, ofwhich I

which Ihave heard aresofter andmore "ligate,'' and
have agreat predominance ofthediesic element.

Ifanywish toexamine thismatter more closely, they
canconsult theTreatises onHarmonics. Mr.Vincent has
calculated these differences bylogarithms tothe60root
of2.
Mypoint is,toprove that theancients didpossess and
practise amodulation which contained much less intervals
than ours,andthatsuch, oranapproach tosuch, modula-
tion (though probably butimperfect) isstill retained
among some people, and that theprinciples onwhich the
Greeks founded their enharmonic genus, still survive in
natural song, though Iwillnotbeboldenough toassert
thatsometimes these songs may notchange intooneof
thechromaticx?°^'*» which, forwant ofpractice, Imight
notbeable todecide. Onething, however, iscertain, that,
asAristoxenus tells us,noperfect earcould modulate
more than twodieses atatime (andthen there wasa
''saltus'' orinterval oftwotones), and astheNew Zea-
landsongs frequently exhibit more than twoclose intervals
together, itismore than probable thatmany ofthese
songs areachromatic, represented by120, 114, 108, or
120,112J,108 ;but itwillnotbeworth while forthepre-
sent purpose todiscuss this nicety, asallwewant isa
practical approximation.

Still survives, Ishall produce, asnearly asmyearcould

melodies;and shall show astillnearer approach tothe
system oftherealGreek enharmonic, inaChinese air
which Iheard andnoted.
Afewremarks onthesystem itself, theintervals, and
thenotation.
SYSTEM.
First, thatanenharmonic modulation might exist is
admitted bymany modern writers. Mr.Donkin, forin-
stance, author oftheable article onAncient Music in
Dr.W.Smith's "Dictionary ofGreek andEoman Anti-
quities," observes (under thetitleof"Music") ofthediffer-
entgenera lessfrequently named,* "that itwould be
wrong toconclude hastily thattheothers would beimpos-
sible inpractice, ornecessarily unpleasing;"andoftheen-
harmonic hesays, "butitisimpossible toform ajudgment
ofitsmerits without amuch greater knowledge ofthe
rules ofcomposition thanseems nowattainable."
Mr.LayTradescant having shown thedifferences of
interval oftheChinese instruments from theintervals
generally inuseinEurope, adds—"Itwill therefore
very readily appear from therespective rules, that the
character ofthemusic, or,ifyou please, themood (he
should have said "genus "),must bevery different from
ourown, and thatnone ofourinstruments (heshould
have said keyed orbored) arecapable ofdoing jus-
tice toany airthat isplayed onthekin" (orscholar's
lute). Hesubjoins :"Inmytravels Isometimes uTote
down the airs that Ihadheard among thenatives, but
though Itookmuch pains tolearn them accurately, I

matic.


324 APPENDIX.
always found theyhad lostsomething oftheir peculiarity
when played upon theviolin.
"Thereason ofthisdefect seems tohavebeen thatthe
intervals oftheIndian music didnotagree with those of
Europe."*
Mr. Tradescant might have added, that there will
always besome difference iuanairplayed ontheguitar
andontheviolin, though theintervals used areesteemed
thesame ;and, again, perhaps thelearned traveller did
nottake care todivide thescale ofhisviolin mathemati-
cally, likethat ofthekin, before hetried the eff'ect ;he
might alsonothave noted theright interval. Hecon-
cludes :"There is,however, aconnection between theChi-
neseand oldScotch music, sothatwhen anyhighly-ad-
mired airsofScotland happen tofallwithin thecompass
ofthekin,theyseem athome when played upon this in-
strument."
Mr.Lane saysthe"canoon" oftheArabians hadtwenty-
fournotes. Dr.Russell toBurney saysthattheArab scale
oftiventy-four notes wasequal toone octave. ButMr.
Lane adds, that "themost remarkable peculiarity inthe
Arab system ofmusic isthedivision oftones into thirds.'"
Hence, fromthesystem ofthirds oftones, Ihaveheard the
Egyptian musicians urge against theEuropean systems of
music thatthey aredeficient inthenumber ofsounds.
Thesame remark wasmade tomebySelim Agar, a
Nubian, when singing someAmharic songs: "Your instru-
ment" (piano), said he,"isverymuch outoftune, and
jumps very much.''
Mr.Lane adds :'*These small anddelicate gradations of
sound giveapeculiar softness totheperformances ofthe
Arab musicians, which aregenerally ofajjlaintive cha-
*LayTradescant's'•'Chinese astheyAre."


APPENDIX. 325
racier; butthey are difficult todiscriminate with exact-
ness, and therefore seldom observed inthevocal and
instrumental music ofthose persons whohavenotmade a
regular study oftheart."
HadMr.Lane been describing thecharacter and diffi-
culties oftheancient Greek enharmonic orchromatic, he
could nothave used other terms; they arealmost the
words ofAristoxenus, Vitruvius, Plutarch, andother an-
cient writers onthese genera; and yet,headds,"hetook
great delight inthemore refined kind ofmusic," and
found "themore hebecame habituated tothestyle the
more hewaspleased with it."Hecontinues :"Hewas
perfectly charmed with theperformance ofsome female
singers, andthatthenatives aresofascinated astolavish
considerable sums onthem."
Precisely sotheGreeks ofold.
INTEEVALS.
Wemust notsuppose thattheGreek enharmonic wasa
consecutive gamut ofquarter-tones— no ;wearetold dis-
tinctly byallauthors (except, perhaps, Salinas), thatthere
wasaquarter-tone, then another quarter-tone, then'a
great interval completing thefourth;orreversely, agreat
interval oftwomajor tones, orabout ourthird major, the
quarter-tone, another quarter-tone, thus completing the
fourth.
Sowith these nations, andespecially intheChinese
airs Ihave heard, there iseither thetwoquarter-tones,
then aninterval ofabout athird ;or,theinterval ofthe
third, andthen thetwodieses orquarter-tones, oritisa
mixed genus, andadds atone orhalf-tone ateither

voured togiveanidea ofthose airsofNewZealand which
Iheard, yetsodifficult isittodiscover theexact interval,
that Iwillnotvouch forthemathematical exactness :nei-
ther will Ipledge myself not tohave written achromatic
foranenharmonic interval, orvice,versa.
Imust also, injustice tomyself, add,that thesinger
didnotalways repeat themusical phrase with precisely
thesame modulation, though, without avery severe test,
thiswould nothave been discernible, northen tomany
ears ;thegeneral effect being toanEuropean earverymo-
notonous.
ButImaysaythat,when Isangthem frommynotation,
theywere recognised andapproved ofbycompetent judges;
andthattheNewZealander himself said, "heshould soon
