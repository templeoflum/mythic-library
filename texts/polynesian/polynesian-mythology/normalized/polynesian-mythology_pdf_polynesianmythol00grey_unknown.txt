PREFACE,
Towards the close oftheyear 1845 Iwas
suddenly andunexpectedly required bytheBritish
Government toadminister theaffairs ofNew Zea-
land,and shortly afterwards received theappoint-
ment ofGovernor-in-Chief ofthose Islands.
When Iarrived inthem, Ifound HerMajesty's
native subjects engaged inhostilities with the
Queen's troops, against whom theyhaduptothat
timecontended with considerable success;somuch
discontent also prevailed generally amongst the
native population, thatwhere disturbances hadnot
yettaken place, there was toomuch reason to
apprehend theywould soon break out, asthey
shortly afterwards did, inseveral parts ofthe
Islands.
Isoon perceived that Icould neither successfully
govern, norhope toconciliate, anumerous and tur-
bulent people, withwhose language, manners, cus-
toms, religion, andmodes ofthought Iwasquite
unacquainted. Inorder toredress their gTievances,


iv PREFACE,
andapply remedies, which would neither wound
their feehngs, normilitate against their prejudices,
itwas necessary that Ishould beablethoroughly
tounderstand their complaints;andtowin their
confidence and regard, itwas also requisite that
Ishould beable atalltimes, andinallplaces,
patiently tolisten tothe tales oftheirwrongs or
sufierings, and,even ifIcould not assist them, to
givethem akind reply, couched insuch terms as
should leave nodoubt ontheir minds that I
clearly understood and felt forthem, andwas
really well disposed towards them.
Although furnished with some very able inter-
preters, whogavemeassistance ofthemost friendly
nature, Isoon found that even with their aidI
could stillonlyvery imperfectly perform myduties.
Icould notatalltimes andinallplaces havean
interpreter bymyside;andthence oftenwhenway-
laidbysome suitor, who had, perhaps, travelled
two orthree hundred miles tolaybefore methe
taleofhisorhergrievances, Iwascompelled to
passonwithout listening, andtowitness with pain
anexpression ofsorrow andkeenly disappointed
hope cloud over features which themoment before
were bright with gladness, that theopportunity so
anxiously looked forhadatlength been secured.
Again, Ifound thatany taleofsorrow orsuffer-
ing,passing through themedium ofaninterpreter.


PREFACE. V
fellmuch more coldly onmy ear,thanwhat it
would have done hadtheperson interested ad-
dressed the tale direct tomyself; and inlike
manner ananswer delivered through theinterven-
tion ofathird person, appeared toleave avery
different impression upon the suitor towhat it
would havehadcoming direct from thelipsofthe
Governor ofthecountry. Moreover, thismode
ofcommunication through athird person was so
cumbrous and slow, that, inorder tocompensate
forthe loss oftime thus occasioned, itbecame
necessary fortheinterpreters tocompress thesub-
stance oftherepresentations made tome,asalso
ofmyown replies, into thefewest words possible;
and asthishadineach instance tobedone hur-
riedly, andatthemoment, there wasreason tofear
thatmuch thatwasmaterial toenable mefully to
understand thequestion brought before me,orthe
suitor tocomprehend myreply, might beuninten-
tionally omitted. Lastly, Ihadonseveral occasions
reasons tobelieve that anative hesitated tostate
facts, ortoexpress feelings andwishes, toaninter-
preter, wdiich hewould most gladly havedone tothe
Governor, could hehave addressed him direct.
These reasons, andothers ofequal force,mademe
feel ittobemyduty tomake myself acquainted,
with theleast possible delay, with thelanguage of
theNew Zealanders, asalsowith their manners,
a2

customs, and prejudices. But Isoon found that
thiswasafarmore difficult matter than Ihad at
first supposed. Thelanguage oftheNew Zea-
landers isavery difficult onetounderstand tho-
roughly :therewasthennodictionary ofitpub-
lished (unless avocabulary canbesocalled);there
were nobooks pubhshed inthelanguage, which
would enable metostudy itsconstruction ;it
varied altogether inform fromanyoftheancient
ormodern languages which Iknew;andmy
thoughts and time were sooccupied with the
cares ofthegovernment ofacountry then pressed
upon bymany difficulties, andwith aformidable
rebellion raging init,that Icould findbutveryfew
hours todevote totheacquisition ofanunwritten
and difficult language. I,however, didmy best,
andcheerfully devoted allmyspare moments toa
task, theaccomplishment ofwhich was necessary
toenable metoperform properly every duty to
mycountry andtothepeople Iwasappointed to
govern.
Soon, however, anewandquite unexpected dif-
ficulty presented itself Onthesideoftherebel
pai'ty were engaged, either openly orcovertly, some
oftheoldest, least civilised, andmost influential
chiefs intheIslands. With them Ihad either
personally, orbywritten communications, todiscuss
questions which involved peace orwar,andon


PREFACE. VU
which thewhole future oftheIslands and ofthe
native racedepended, sothat itwasinthehighest
degree essential that Ishould fully and entirely
comprehend their thoughts andintentions, andthat
they should not inanywaymisunderstand the
nature oftheengagements intowhich Ientered
with them.
Tomy surprise, how^ever, Ifound that these
chiefs, either intheir speeches tome,orintheir
letters, frequently quoted, inexplanation oftheir
views and intentions, fragments ofancient poems
orproverbs, ormade allusions which rested on
anancient system ofmythology;andalthough it
was clear that themost important parts oftheir
communications wereembodied inthese figurative
forms, theinterpreters were quite atfault, they
could then rarely (ifever) translate thepoems or
explain theallusions, andtherewasnopublication
inexistence which threw any light upon these
subjects, orwhich gave themeaning ofthe gi'eat
mass ofthewords which thenatives upon such
occasions made useof;sothat Iwascompelled to
content myself with ashort general statement of
what some other native believed thatthewriter of
theletter intended toconvey ashismeaning bythe
fragment ofthepoem hehad quoted, orbythe
allusions hehadmade. Ishould add,thateven the
great majority oftheyoung Christian natives were


Vlll PREFACE.
quite asmucli atfault onthese subjects aswere
theEuropean interpreters.
Clearly, however, Icould not,asGovernor ofthe
country, permit soclose aveil toremain drawn
between myself andtheagedandinfluential chiefs,
whom itwasmyduty toattach toBritish interests
and totheBritish race,whose regard and confi-
dence, asalsothat oftheir tribes, itwasmydesire
tosecure, andwithwhom itwasnecessary that I
should holdthemost unrestricted intercourse. Only
onething could, under such circumstances, bedone,
andthatwas toacquaint myself with theancient
language ofthecountry, tocollect itstraditional
poems and legends, toinduce their priests toim-
part tometheir mythology, and tostudy their
proverbs. Formore than eight years Idevoted a
great partofmyavailable time tothese pm-suits. In-
deed Iworked atthisduty inmyspare moments
inevery part ofthecountry Itraversed, andduring
mymany voyages fi'om portion toportion ofthe
Islands. Iwasalsoalways accompanied bynatives,
and still atevery possible interval pursued myin-
quiries into these subjects. Once,when Ihadwith
great pains amassed alarge mass ofmaterials toaid
meinmystudies, theGovernment House was de-
stroyed byfire,andwith itwere burnt themate-
rials Ihad socollected, andthus Iwas left to
commence againmydifficult andwearying task.


PREFACE. IX
The ultimate result, however, was, that Iac-
quired agreat amount ofinformation onthese
subjects, and collected alarge mass ofmaterials,
which was, however, from themanner inwhich
theywere acquired, inavery scattered state—for
different portions ofthesamepoem orlegend were
often collected from different natives, invery dis-
tant parts ofthecountry ;long intervals oftime,
also, frequently elapsed after Ihadobtained one
part ofapoem orlegend, before Icould find a
native accurately acquainted with another portion
ofit;consequently thefragments thus obtained
were scattered through different note-books, and,
before they could begiven tothepublic, required
tobecarefully arranged and re-written, and,what
was stillmore difficult (whether viewed inrefer-
ence tothereal difficulty offairly translating the
ancient language inwhich theywere composed, or
mymany public duties), itwasnecessary thatthey
should betranslated.
Having, however, withmuch toilacquired in-
formation which Ifound souseful tomyself, I
feltunwilling thattheresult ofmylabours should
belost tothose whose duty itmaybehereafter
todealwith thenatives ofNew Zealand;andI
therefore undertook anew task, which Ihave
often, very often, been sorely tempted toabandon;
butthesame sense ofdutywhich mademeorigi-

nally enter upon thestudy ofthenative language
hasenabled metopersevere uptothepresent period,
when Ihave already published onelarge volume
inthenative language, containing avery extensive
collection oftheancient traditional poems, religious
chants andsongs oftheMaori race,and Inow
present totheEuropean reader atranslation ofthe
principal portions oftheir ancient mythology, and
ofsome oftheirmost interesting legends.
Another reason that hasmademeanxious to
impart tothepublic themost material portions of
theinformation Ihave thus attained is,that, pro-
bably, tonoother person butmyself would many
oftheir ancient rythmical prayers and traditions
have been imparted bytheir priests ;and itisless
likely thatanyonecouldnow acquire them, as
Iregret tosaythatmost oftheir old chiefs, and
even some oftliemiddle-aged oneswho aidedme
inmyresearches, have already passed tothetomb.
With regard tothestyle ofthetranslation a
fewwords arerequired :Ifear inpoint ofcare
andlanguage itwillnotsatisfy thecritical reader;
butIcantruly saythat Ihavehadnoleisure care-
fully torevise it ;thetranslation isalso faith-
ful,and itisalmost impossible closely and faith-
fully totranslate avery difficult language, without
ahnost insensibly falling somewhat into theidiom
andform ofconstruction ofthat language, which,


PREFACE. XI
perhaps, from itsunusualness, mayprove unplea-
sant totheEuropean earandmind, and thismust
beessentially thecaseinawork like thepresent,
noconsiderable continuous portion oftheoriginal
whereof was derived from oneperson, butwhich
iscompiled from thewritten ororally delivered
narratives ofmany, each differing from theothers
instyle, andsome even materially from therest
indialect.
Ihave said that thetranslation isclose and
faithfril :itissotothefullextent ofmypowers, and
fr-om the little time Ihave had atmy disposal.
Ihave done nomore than add insome places
such few explanatory words aswere necessary
toenable aperson unacquainted with theproduc-
tions, customs, orrehgion ofthecountry, tounder-
standwhat thenarrator meant. Forthefirst time,
Ibelieve, aEuropean reader will find itinhis
power toplace himself intheposition ofonewho
listens toaheathen and savage high-priest, ex-
plaining tohim, inhisownwords, andinhisown
energetic manner, thetraditions inwhich heear-
nestly believes, andunfolding thereligious opinions
uponwhich thefaithandhopes ofhisrace rest.
That their traditions arepuerile, istrue ;thatthe
religious faith oftheraceswho trust inthem is
absurd, isamelancholy fact ;but allmyexpe-
rience leadsmetobelieve that theSaxon, Celtic,


XU PREFACE.
and Scandinavian systems ofmythology, could
wehavebecome intimately acquainted with them,
would befound innorespects tosurpass thatone
which theEuropean reader maynow thorouglily
understand. Ibelieve that theignorance which
hasprevailed regarding themythological systems
ofbarbarous orsemi-barbarous races hastoogene-
rally ledtotheir being considered fargrander and
more reasonable than they really were.
But thepuerility ofthese traditions and bar-
barous mythological systems bynomeans dimi-
nishes their importance asregards their influence
upon thehuman race. Those contained inthepresent
volumes have, with slight modifications, prevailed
perhaps considerably more thantwothousand years
throughout thegreat mass oftheislands ofthe
Pacific Ocean /and, indeed, tliereligious system of
ancient Mexico was,probably, tosome extent con-
nected with them. They have been believed in
andobeyed bymany millions ofthehuman race;
and itisstillmore melancholy toreflect thatthey
were based upon asystem ofhuman sacrifices to
thegods;sothat ifweallowthem tohave existed
fortwothousand years, andthat, inaccordance with
theriteswhich arebased upon them, atleasttwo
thousand human victims were annually sacrificed
throughout thewhole extent ofthenumerous
islands inwhich they prevailed (both ofwhich sup-


PREFACE. xill
positions areprobably much within thetruth), then
atleast four millions ofhuman heinous have been
offered insacrifice tofalsegods;andtothisnumber
weshould have toaddafrightful listofchildren
murdered under thesystem ofinfanticide, which
thesame traditions encouraged, asalsoavery large
number ofpersons destroyed forhaving been be-
lieved guilty ofthecrime ofsorcery orwitcli-
craft.
Itmust further beborne inmind, thatthenative
races,whobeheved inthese traditions orsupersti-
tions, areinnoway deficient inintellect, andinno
respect incapable ofreceiving thetruths ofChris-
tianity;onthecontrary, they readily embrace its
doctrines andsubmit toitsrules;inour schools
they stand afaircomparison with Europeans, and,
when instructed inChristian truths, blush attheir
own former ignorance and superstitions, andlook
backwithshame andloathing upon their previous
state ofwickedness and credulity ;andvet fora
great part oftheir liveshave they, and, forthou-
sands ofyears before theywere born, have their
forefathers, impKcitly submitted themselves tothose
very superstitions, and followed those cruel and
barbarous rites.

POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY,
THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN AND
EARTH.
(kONGATAMA ARANGT—TRADITION RELATING TOTHEORIGIN OF
THEHUMAN RACE.)
Menhadbutonepair ofprimitive ancestors;they
sprang from thevastheaven that exists above us,
andfrom theearthwhich hesbeneath us. Accord-
ingtothetraditions ofour race,Eangi andPapa,
orHeaven andEarth, were thesoui'ce from which,
inthebeginning, allthings originated. Darkness
then rested upon theheaven andupon theearth,
andthey stillboth clave together, fortheyhadnot
yetbeen rent apart ;and thechildren theyhad
begotten were ever thinking amongst themselves
what might bethedifference between darkness
and light;theyknew that beings hadmultiplied
and increased, and yet light hadnever broken
upon them, but itever continued dark. Hence
these sayings arefound inourancient religious
services :"There wasdarkness from the first divi-


2 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
sion oftime, unto thetenth, tothehundredth, to
thethousandth,"' that is,foravast space oftime;
and these divisions oftimes were considered as
beings, andwere eachtermed aPo ;andontheir
account therewas asyetnoworld with itsbright
light, butdarkness only forthebeings which
existed.
Atlastthebeings whohadbeen begotten by
Heaven and Earth, worn outbythecontinued
darkness, consulted amongst themselves, saying,
"Letusnowdetermine whatweshould dowith
Bangi and Papa, whether itwould bebetter to
slaythem ortorendthem apart. Then spoke Tu-
matauenga, the fiercest ofthechildren ofHeaven
andEarth, "Itiswell, letusslaythem."
Then spake Tane-mahuta, thefather offorests
andofallthings that inhabit them, orthat are
constructed from trees, "Nay, not so. Itisbetter
torendthem apart, and tolettheheaven stand
farabove us,andtheearth lieunder our feet. Let
theskybecome asastranger tous,buttheearth
remain close tousasournursing mother.''
Thebrothers allconsented tothisproposal, with
theexception ofTawhiri-ma-tea, the father of
winds andstorms, and he,fearing that hiskingdom
wasabout tobeoverthrown, grieved greatly atthe
tliought ofhisparents being torn apart. Five of


THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 3
thebrothers willingly consented totheseparation
oftheir parents, butoneofthemwould notagree
toit.
Hence, also, these sayings ofoldarefound inour
prayers, "Darkness, darkness, light, light, theseek-
ing,thesearching, inchaos, inchaos;''these sig-
nified theway inwhich theoffspring ofheaven
andearth sought forsomemode ofdealing with
their parents, sothathuman beings might increase
and live.
So,also, these sayings ofoldtime, "Themulti-
tude, the length,"' signified themultitude ofthe
thoughts ofthechildren ofHeaven and Earth,
and thelength oftime they considered whether
they should slay their parents, thathuman beings
might becalled into existence;for itwas inthis
manner that they talked and consulted amongst
themselves.
But atlength their plans having been agreed
on, lo,Rongo-ma-tane, thegodand father ofthe
cultivated food ofman, rises up,that hemayrend
apart theheavens andtheearth;hestruggles, but
herends them notapart. Lo,next, Tangaroa, the
godand father offishand reptiles, rises up,that
hemayrend apart theheavens andtheearth;he
also struggles, butherends them notapart. Lo,.
next, Haumia-tikitiki, thegodand father ofthe
food ofman which springs without cultivation,
B2


4 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY,
rises upand struggles, but ineffectually. Lo,
then, Tu-matauenga, thegodand father offierce
human beings, risesupand struggles, but he,too,
fails inhis efforts. Then, atlast, slowly uprises
Tane-mahuta, thegodand father offorests, of
birds, and ofinsects, and hestruggles with his
parents ;invain hestrives torendthem apart
with hishands andarms. Lo,hepauses;hishead
isnow firmly planted onhismother theearth, his
feetheraises upand rests against hisfather the
skies, hestrains hisback andlimbs with mighty
effort. Now arerent apart "Rangi andPapa, and
with criesandgroans ofwothey shriek aloud,
''Wherefore slayyou thus your parents ?Why
commit you sodreadful acrime astoslay us,asto
rend your parents apart?" But,Tane-mahuta
pauses not,heregards nottheir shrieks and cries;
far,farbeneath himhepresses down theearth;far,
furabove himhethrusts upthesky.
Hence these sayings ofolden time, "Itwasthe
fierce thrusting ofTane which tore theheaven
from theearth, sothattheywere rent apart, and
darkness wasmade manifest, and sowas the
light."
Nosooner washeaven rentfrom earth than the
multitude ofhuman beings were discovered whom
theyhadbegotten, andwhohad hitherto laincon-
cealed between thebodies ofRangi andPapa.


THECHILDKEN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 5
Then, also, there arose inthebreast ofTawhiri-
ma-tea, thegodandfather ofwinds and storms, a
lierce desire towagewarwith hisbrothers, because
theyhadrent apart theircommon parents. He
from the firsthadrefused toconsent tohismother
being tornfrom lierlordandchildren;itwas his
brothers alone thatwished forthis separation, and
desired that Papa-tu-a-nuku, ortheEarth alone,
should beleftasaparent forthem.
Thegodofhurricanes andstorms dreads also
thattheworld should become too fairand beauti-
ful,soherises, follows hisfather totherealms
above, and hurries tothesheltered hollows inthe
boundless skies ;there hehides and clings, and
nestling inthisplace :pfrestheconsults longwith
hisparent, and asthevastHeaven listens tothe
suggestions ofTawhiri-ma-tea, thoughts and plans
areformed inhisbreast, andTawhiri-ma-tea also
understands what heshould do.Then byhimself
andthevastHeaven were begotten hisnumerous
brood, and they rapidly increased and grew.
Tawhiri-ma-tea despatches oneofthem tothewest-
ward, andone tothesouthward, andonetothe
eastward, andonetothenorthward;andhegives
corresponding names tohimself andtohisprogeny
themighty winds.
Henext sends forth fierce squalls, whirlwinds^


b POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
deDse clouds, massy clouds, dark clouds, gloomy
thick clouds, fiery clouds, clouds which precede
hurricanes, clouds offiery black, clouds reflecting
glowing red light, clouds wildly drifting from all
quarters andwildly bursting, clouds ofthunder
storms, andclouds hurriedly flying. Inthemidst
ofthese Tawhiri-ma-tea himself sweeps wildly on.
Alas !alas !then rages the fierce hurricane;and
whilst Tane-mahuta and hisgigantic forests still
stand, unconscious and unsuspecting, theblast of
thebreath ofthemouth ofTawhiri-ma-tea smites
them, thegigantic trees aresnapt ofi"right inthe
middle;alas !alas !they are rent toatoms,
dashed tothe earth, with boughs andbranches
tornand scattered, andlying ontheearth, trees
andbranches allalike left forthe insect, forthe
grub, and forloathsome rottenness.
From theforests andtheir inhabitants Tawhiri-
ma-tea nextswoops down upon theseas,andlashes
inhiswrath theocean. Ah !ah !waves^steep as
clifl*s arise, whose summits aresolofty that tolook
fromthemwould make thebeholder giddy ;these
sooneddy inwhirlpools, andTangaroa, thegodof
ocean, and father ofallthat dwell therein, flies
affi'ighted through hisseas;butbefore hefled, liis
children consulted together howtheymight secure
their safety, forTangaroa hadbegotten Punga, and


THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEAETH. 7
hehadbegotten two children, Ika-tere, thefather
offish,andTu-te-wehiwehi, orTu-te-wanawana, the
father ofreptiles.
When Tangaroa fledforsafety totheocean, then
Tu-te-wehiwehi and Ika-tere, and their children,
disputed together astowhat they should doto
escape from thestorms, andTu-te-wehiwehi and
hisparty cried aloud, "Let usflyinland;'' but
Ika-tere and hisparty cried aloud, "Letusflyto
thesea." Some would notobey one order, some
would notobey theother, andthey escaped intwo
parties :theparty ofTu-te-wehiwehi, ortherep-
tiles, hidthemselves ashore ;theparty ofPunga
rushed tothe sea. This iswhat, inourancient
religious services, iscalled theseparation ofTa-
whiri-ma-tea.
Hence these traditions havebeenhanded down:
—"Ika-tere, thefather ofthings wliich inhabit
water, cried aloud toTu-te-wehiwehi,'Ho,ho,let
usallescape tothesea.'
"ButTu-te-wehiwehi shouted inanswer,'Nay,
nay, letusrather flyinland.'
"Then Ika-tere warned him, saying,'Fly in-
land, then;andthefateofyouandyour race will
be,thatwhen they catch you, before you are
cooked, they will singe offyour scales over a
lighted wisp ofdry fern.'


8 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
"But Tu-te-wehiwehi answered him, saying,
'Seek safety, then, inthesea ;andthefuture fate
ofyour race will be,thatwhen they serve out little
baskets ofcooked vegetable food toeach person,
youwillbelaidupon thetopofthefood togivea
relish toit/
"Then without delay these two races ofbeings
separated. The fish fled inconfusion tothe sea,
the reptiles sought safety inthe forests and
scrubs/'
Tangaroa, enraged atsome ofhischildren desert-
inghim, and, being sheltered bythegodofthe
forests ondry land, hasever since waged war
onhisbrother Tane, who, inreturn, haswaged
war against him.
Hence Tane supplies theoffspring ofhisbrother
Tu-matauenga with canoes, with spears andwith fish-
hooks made from histrees,andwith netswoven from
hisfibrous plants, that theymay destroy the ofi*-
spring ofTangaroa; whilst Tangaroa, inreturn, swal-
lowsuptheoffspring ofTane, overwhelming canoes
with thesurges ofhissea,swallowing upthelands,
trees, andhouses that areswept off*byfloods, and
ever wastes awa}^, with hislapping waves, the
shores thatconfine him,thatthegiants oftheforests
may bewashed down andswept outinto his
boundless ocean, that hemay then swallow up


THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 9
the insects, theyoung birds, andthevarious ani-
mals which inhabit them,—allwhich things are
recorded intheprayers which were offered tothese
gods.
Tawhiri-ma-tea next rushed ontoattack his
brothers Eongo-ma-tane andHaumia-tikitiki, the
godsandprogenitors ofcultivated anduncultivated
food;butPapa, tosave these forherother children,
caught them up,andhidthem inaplace ofsafety;
and sowellwere these children ofhers concealed
bytheirmother Earth, thatTawhiri-ma-tea sought
forthem invain.
Tawhiri-ma-tea having thus vanquished allhis
other brothers, next rushed against Tu-mata-
uenga, totryhisstrength against his ;heexerted
allhisforce against him, buthecould neither
shake him orprevail against him. What didTu-
matauenga care forhisbrother's wrath ?hewas
theonlyoneofthewhole party ofbrothers who
hadplanned thedestruction oftheir parents, and
hadshown himself brave and fierce inwar;his
brothers hadyielded atonce before thetremendous
assaults ofTawhiri-ma-tea and hisprogeny—Ta-
ne-mahuta and hisoffspring hadbeenbroken and
torn inpieces—Tangaroa and hischildren had
fled tothedepths oftheocean ortherecesses of
the shore—Rongo-ma-tane and Haumia-tikitiki

hadbeen hidden fromhim intheearth—butTu-
matauenga, orman, stillstood erect andunshaken
upon thebreast ofhismother Earth;andnow at
length thehearts ofHeaven andofthegodof
storms became tranquil, and their passions were
assuaged.
Tu-matauenga, orfierce man, having thus suc-
cessfully resisted hisbrother, thegodofhurricanes
andstorms, next took thought howhecould turn
upon hisbrothers andslaythem, because theyhad
not assisted him orfought bravely when Tawhiri-
ma-tea hadattacked them toavenge thesepara-
tionoftheir parents, andbecause theyhad lefthim
alone toshow hisprowess inthe fight. Asyet
death hadnopower overman. Itwasnotuntil
thebirth ofthechildren ofTaranga andofMakea-
tu-tara, ofMaui-taha, ofMaui-roto, ofMaui-pae, of
Maui-waho, and ofMaui-tikitiki-o-Taranga, the
demi-god who tried todrain Hine-nui-te-po, that
death hadpower overmen. Ifthatgoddess had
notbeen deceived byMaui-tikitiki, menwould not
have died, butwould inthat casehave lived for
ever ;itwasfrom hisdeceiving Hine-nui-te-po that
death obtained power overmankind, andpenetrated
toevery part oftheearth.
Tu-matauenga continued toreflect upon the
cowardly manner inwhich hisbrothers had acted,


THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 11
inleaving him toshow hiscourage alone, andhe
first sought some means ofinjuring Tane-mahuta,
because hehadnotcome toaidhiminhiscombat
with Tawhiri-ma-tea, and partly because hewas
aware thatTanehadhadanumerous progeny, who
were rapidly increasing, andmight atlastprove
hostile tohim,and injure him, sohebegan to
collect leaves ofthewhanake tree,and twisted
them into nooses, andwhen hiswork wasended,
hewent tothe forest toputuphissnares, and
hung themup—ha !ha !thechildren ofTane fell
before him,none ofthem could anylonger flyor
move insafety.
Then henextdetermined totake revenge onhis

plants wliich hadbeen dugupwithered inthe
sun.
Thus Tu-matauenga devoured allhisbrothers,
andconsumed thewhole ofthem, inrevenge for
their having deserted himand lefthim tofight
alone against Tawhiri-ma-tea andEangi.
When hisbrothers had allthus been overcome
byTu',heassumed several names, namely, Tu-ka-
riri,Tu-ka-nguha, Tu-ka-taua, Tu-whaka-heke-tan-
gata, Tu-matarwha-iti, andTu-matauenga ;heas-
sumed onename foreach ofhisattributes dis-
played inthevictories over hisbrothers. Four of
hisbrothers were entirely deposed byhim,andbe-
came hisfood ;butoneofthem, Tawhiri-ma-tea,
hecould notvanquish ormake common, byeating
him forfood, sohe,the lastborn child ofHeaven
andEarth, was leftasanenemy forman,and still,
with arageequal tothat ofMau, thiselder brother
ever attacks him instorms and hurricanes, endea-
vouring todestroy him alikebyseaandland.
Now, themeanings ofthese names ofthe chil-
dren oftheHeaven andEarth areasfollows:—
Tangaroa signifies fishofevery kind;Rongo-
ma-tane signifies thesweet potato, and allvege-
tables cultivated asfood;Haumia-tikitiki signifies
fern root,and allkinds offoodwhich grow wild;
Tane-mahuta signifies forests, thebirdsandinsects


''THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 13
which inhabit them, and allthings fashioned from
wood ;Tawhiri-ma-tea signifies winds andstorms;
andTu-matauenga signifies man.
Four ofhisbrothers having, asbefore stated,
beenmade common, orarticles offood,byTu-mata-
uenga, heassigned foreach ofthem fitting incanta-
tions, that theymight beabundant, and that he
might easily obtain them.
Some incantations were proper toTane-mahuta,
theywere called Tane.
Some incantations were forTangaroa, theywere
called Tangaroa.
Some were forKongo-ma-tane, theywere called
Rongo-ma-tane.
Some were forHaumia-tikitiki, theywere called
Haumia.
Thereason thathesought outthese incantations
was, that hisbrothers might bemadecommon by
him,andserve forhisfood. There were also in-
cantations forTawhiri-ma-tea tocause favourable
winds, and prayers tothevastHeaven forfair
weather, asalso formother Earth that shemight
produce allthings abundantly. But itwas the
greatGod that taught these prayers toman.
There were alsomany prayers andincantations
composed forman, suited tothe difierent times
andcircumstances ofhis life—prayers atthebap-


14 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
tism ofaninfant; prayers forabundance offood,
forwealth; prayers inillness; prayers tospirits,
and formany other things.
Thebursting forth ofthewrathful fury ofTa-
wliiri-ma-tea against hisbrothers, wasthecause of
thedisappearance ofagreat part ofthedryland;
during that contest agreat part ofmother Earth
was submerged. Thenames ofthose beings of
ancient dayswhosubmerged solarge aportion of
theearth were—Terrible-rain, Long-continued-rain,
Fierce-hail-storms ;and their progeny were. Mist,
Heavy-dew, andLight-dew, andthese together sub-
merged thegreater part oftheearth, sothatonly
asmall portion ofdryland projected above the
sea.
From that time clear light increased upon the
earth, and allthebeings which were hidden be-
tween Rangi andPapa before theywere separated,
now multiplied upon theearth. The firstbeings
begotten byRangi andPapa were notlikehuman
beings ;butTu-matauenga bore thelikeness ofa
man, asdid allhisbrothers, asalsodidaPo,aAo,
aKore, teKimihanga andRunuku, andthus it
continued until thetimes ofNgainui and hisgene-
ration, andofWhiro-te-tujDua and hisgeneration,
andofTiki-tawhito-ariki aud hisgeneration, and
ithassocontinued tothisday.


THECHILDREN OFHEAVEN ANDEARTH. 15
The children ofTu-matauenga were begotten
onthisearth, andthey inereased, andcontinued to
multiply, untilwereach atlastthegeneration of
Maui-taha, and ofhisbrothers Maui-roto, Maui-
waho, Maui-pae, and Maui-tikitiki-o-Taranga.
Uptothistime thevastHeaven has stillever
remained separated from hisspouse theEarth.
Yet their mutual love still continues—the soft
warm sighs ofherloving bosom still ever riseup
tohim,ascending from thewoody mountains and
valleys, andmen callthese mists ;andthevast
Heaven, ashemourns tln^ough thelong nights his
separation from hisbeloved, drops frequent tears
upon herbosom, andmen seeing these, termthem
dew-drops.

OnedayMaui asked hisbrothers totellhim the
place where their father andmother dwelt ;he
begged earnestly thattheywould make thisknown

where thetwooldpeople dwelt ;andthey replied
tohim, "We don't know;how canwe tell
whether they dwell upabove theearth, ordown

Forhehadfound something outafter hewas
discovered byhismother, byhisrelations, andby
hisbrothers. They discovered him onenight
whilst tlieywere alldancing inthegreat House
ofAssembly. Whilst hisrelations were alldanc-

manner. For little Maui, theinfant, crept intothe
house, andwent and satbehind oneofhisbro-

counted herchildren that they might stand up
ready forthedance, shesaid—
"One, that 'sMaui-

another, and cried out, "Hollo, where did this

answered, "Ah, I'myour child too." Then the
oldwoman counted them allover again, and said,
"Oh,no,there ought tobeonly fourofyou ;now
forthe firsttime I've seenyou." Then littleMaui

about this intheverymiddle oftheranks ofall

Atlast shegotangry, and cried out, "Come,

Then thetwo elder brothers said tothetwo
younger ones, "Never mind, lethimbeom-dear

Thetwoyounger brothers, when they heard this,
answered, "Yes, yes, oh,eldest brothers ofours,you
arequite right ;letourmurmuring endhere/'
Itwasnownight;butearly inthemorning Ta-

Now atnightfall when their mother came back

crept outinthenight and stole hismother's apron,
her belt,and clothes, andhidthem; then hewent
andstopped upevery crevice inthewooden win-

dawn might notshine into thehouse, andmake
hismother hurry togetup.But after hehad
done this, his little heart still feltvery anxious
anduneasy lest hismother should, inherim-
patience, riseinthedarkness and defeat hisplans.
But thenight dragged itsslow length along with-
outhismother moving;atlast there came the
faint light ofearly morn, sothat atoneendofa
long house youcould seethe legs ofthepeople
sleeping attheother end of it,but hismother
still slept on;then thesunrose up,andmounted
farupabove thehorizon;now atlasthismother
moved, andbegan tothink toherself, "What kind of
night can this be,tolast solong?'' andhaving
thought thus, shedropped asleep again. Again she
awoke, andbegan tothink toherself, butcould
not tellthat itwasbroad daylight outside, as
thewindow andevery chink inthehouse were
stopped closely up.

Assoon ashismother gotoutside thehouse,

Hecovered uptheholeagain andreturned to

Then hisbrothers made haste andgotup;alas!

The littleMauinow asked hisbrothers again,

His brothers feltquite surprised and pleased
with their little brother when theyheard himtalk
inthisway,andwhen after alittle time theyhad
recovered from their amazement, they toldhim to
tryand find their father and mother. Sohe
saidhewould go. Itwasalong time agothat
hehad finished his first labour, forwhen he
first appeared tohisrelatives intheir house of
singing anddancing, hehadonthat occasion trans-
formed himself into theHkeness ofallmanner of
birds, ofevery bird intheworld, andyetnosingle
form thathethenassumed hadpleased hisbrothers;
butnowwhen heshowed himself tothem, trans-

What made himnowlook sowell intheshape

transform himself into thelikeness ofapigeon,
heassumed exactly thesame form asonthepre-

Hisbrothers answered himthus:—"Thatmight be

Then hismother asked Maui,whowas sitting

liisalarm andanxiety were therefore extreme. At
night-fall they allwent into hishouse.
Maui, after these things, returned tohisbrothers
totellthem thathehadfound hisparents, andto

Shortly afterMaui had thus returned tohis

Heasked again,—"Where does shedwell?''
They answered,—"Yonder.''
Thereupon hesays,—"That willdo;leave here
thepresent offood, Iwillcarry ittohermyself"
From thattime thedaily presents offood forhis
ancestress were carried byMaui himself; buthe
never tookandgavethem toherthat shemight
eatthem, buthequietly laidthembyonone side,
and thishedid formany days. At last,Muri-

going on,and thenext time hecame along the
path carrying thepresent offood, theold chief-
tainess sniffed and sniffed until shethought she

exasperated, andherstomach began todistend itself,
thatshemight beready todevour Maui assoon as
hecame there. Then sheturned tothesouthward,
andsmelt and sniffed, butnotascent ofanything
reached her ;then sheturned round from thesouth
tothenorth, bythe east,with hernoseupinthe
airsniffing and smelling toevery point asshe
turned slowly round, butshecould notdetect the
slightest scent ofahuman being, and almost
thought that shemust have been mistaken;but
shemade onemore trial, and sniffed thebreeze
towards thewestward. Ah !then thescent ofa
mancame plainly toher,soshecalled aloud—"I
know from thesmell wafted here tomebythe
breeze thatsomebody isclose tome,''andMaui
murmured assent. Thus the oldwoman knew
thathewasadescendant ofhers,andherstomach,
which was quite large and distended, immediately
began toshrink, and contract itself again. Ifthe
smell ofMaui hadnotbeen carried tolierbythe
western breeze, undoubtedly shewould have eaten
himup.
When thestomach ofMuri-ranoja-whenua had
quietly sunkdown toitsusual size, hervoice
wasagain heard saying, "Art thou Maui?'' and
heanswered, "Even so."
Then sheasked him, "Wherefore hast thou
served thyoldancestress inthis deceitful way?"

andMaui answered, "Iwasanxious thatthyjaw-
bone, bywhich thegreat enchantments canbe
wrought, should begiven tome/'
Sheanswered, "Take it,ithasbeen reserved for
thee/' AndMaui took it,andhaving done so
returned totheplace where heand hisbrothers
dwelt.
Theyoung hero, Maui, hadnotbeen long at
home with hisbrothers when hebegan tothink,
that itwastoosoon after therising ofthesunthat
itbecame night again, andthat thesunagain sank
down below thehorizon, eyery day,every day ;in
thesame manner thedays appeared tooshort to
him. Soatlast,onedayhesaid tohisbrothers,
"Letusnow catch thesuninanoose, sothatwe
may compel him tomove more slowly, inorder
thatmankind mayhave long days tolabour into
procure subsistence forthemselves ;"butthey an-
swered him,"Why,. noman could approach iton
account ofitswarmth, andthe fierceness ofits
heat;" buttheyoung hero said tothem,"Have

[This hedidsoon after hewas born, and itwas
after that hesnared thesun.] Therefore, asfor
that feat, oh,mybrothers, thechanging myself
into birds, Iaccomplished itbyenchantments, and
Iwillbythesame means accomplish also this
other thing which Ihave inmymind.'' When
hisbrothers heard this, they consented onhisper-
suasions toaidhim intheconquest ofthesun.
Then theybegan tospinandtwist ropes toform
anoose tocatch thesun in,andindoing thisthey
discovered themode ofplaiting flax into stout
square-shaped ropes (tuaonaJca), andthemanner of
plaiting flatropes {j>aharahara), andofspinning
round ropes ;atlast,they finished making allthe
ropes which they required. Then Maui tookup
hisenchanted weapon, andhetook hisbrothers
with him,andthey carried their provisions, ropes,
andother things with them, intheir liands. They
travelled allnight, andassoon asdaybroke, they
halted inthedesert, andhidthemselves thatthey
might notbeseenbythesun ;and atnight
they renewed their journey, and before dawn
they halted, andhidthemselves again ;atlength
they gotvery far,very far,totheeastward, and

came tothevery edge oftheplace outofwhich
thesun rises.
Then they settowork andbuiltoneach sideof
this place along high wall ofclay, with huts of
boughs oftrees ateachendtohidethemselves in;
when these were finished, theymade theloops of
thenoose, andthebrothers ofMaui then layinwait
ononesideoftheplace outofwhich thesun rises,
andMaui himself layinwaitupon theother side.
Theyoung hero held inhishand hisenchanted
weapon, thejaw-bone ofhisancestress—ofMuri-
ranga-whenua, and said tohisbrothers, "Mind

Maui-taha and hisbrothers after this feat re-
turned again totheirownhouse, anddwelt there,
anddwelt there, anddwelt there;andafter along
time hisbrothers went out fishing, whilst Maui-
tiki-tiki-o-Taranga stopped idly athome doing no-
tliing, although indeed hehadtolisten tothesulky

chanted fish-hook, which waspointed with partof
thejaw-bone ofMuri-ranga-whenua, andwhen he
hadfinished this,hetwisted astout fishing-line to
hishook.
His brothers inthemeantime had arranged
amongst themselves tomake fast the lashings
ofthetopsides oftheir canoe, inorder togoout
foragood day's fishing. When allwasmade
ready they launched their canoe, and assoon
asitwas afloat Maui jumped into it,and his
brothers, whowere afraid ofhisenchantments, cried
out, "Come, getoutagain,wewillnot letyougo

whilst hisbrothers paddled ofl",andwhen they
reached thefishing ground they layupon their
paddles and fished, and after agood day's sport
returned ashore.

fishing again, andtheyhad their canoe launched,
andpaddled outtoseawithout ever seeing Maui,
wholayhidinthehollow ofthecanoe under the
bottom boards. When they gotwell outtosea
Maui crept outofhishiding place ;assoon ashis
brothers sawhim, they said, "Wehad better get
back totheshore again asffistaswecan,since this
fellow isonboard;"'butMaui,byhisenchantments,
stretched outtheseasothattheshore instantty be-
came very distant from them, andbythetimethey
could turnthemselves round tolook for it,itwas
outofview. Mauinow said tothem,"You had

useful tobail thewater outofourcanoe/' To
thisthey consented, andthey paddled onagain
and speedily arrived atthefishing ground where
theyused tofishupon former occasions. Assoon as
they gotthere hisbrothers said, "Letusdrop the
anchor and fish here;'' andheanswered, "Oh no,
don't ;wehadmuch better paddle along distance

then say, "Wearenow farenough/' Andhere-

Atlast tlieyreach theopen sea,andhisbrothers
begin tofish. Lo, lo,theyhadhardly lettheir
hooksdown tothebottom, when they each pulled
upafishinto thecanoe. Twice only they let
down their lines,when behold thecanoe was filled
upwith thenumber offishthey had caught.
Then hisbrothers said, "Oh,brother, letusall
return now." And heanswered them, "Stay a
little;letmealsothrowmyhook into the sea.''
And hisbrothers replied, "Where didyougeta
hook?" And heanswered, "Oh, never mind, I
have ahook ofmyown." And hisbrothers re-
plied again, "Make haste andthrow itthen."
And ashepulled itoutfrom under hisgarments,
thelight flashed from thebeautiful mother-of-pearl
shell inthehollow ofthehook, andhisbrothers saw


42 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
that thehookwascarved andornamented with
tufts ofhair pulled from the tailofadog,and it
looked exceedingly beautiful. Maui thenasked his
brothers togivehimalittle bait tobait hishook
with ;butthey rephed, "We willnotgiveyou
any ofour bait/' Sohedoubled his fistand
struck hisnose violently, andtheblood gushed out,
andhesmeared hishookwith hisown blood for
bait,andthen hecast itintothe sea,and itsank
down, andsank down, till itreached tothesmall
carved figure ontheroof ofahouse atthebottom
ofthesea,then passing bythe figure, itdescended
along theoutside carved rafters ofthe roof,and
fellinatthedoorway ofthehouse, and thehook
ofMaui-tikitiki-o-Taranga caught first inthe sillof
thedoorway.
Then, feeling something onhishook, hebegan
tohaul inhis line.Ah !ah !there ascended on
hishook thehouse ofthat oldfellow Tonga-
nui. Itcame up,up ;and asitrose high, oh,
dear !how hishookwas strained with itsgreat
weight ;andthen there came gurgling upfoam
and bubbles from the earth, asofanisland
emerging from thewater, and hisbrothers opened
their mouths and cried aloud.
Maui allthistime continued tochaunt forth
hisincantations amidst themurmurings andwail-
ings ofhisbrothers, who were weeping and


THELEGEND OFMAUI. 43
lamenting, and saying, "Seenow,how hehas
brought usoutinto theopen sea,thatwemaybe
upset in it,anddevoured bythe fish/' Then
heraised aloud hisvoice, andrepeated theincan-
tation called Hiki, which makes heavy weights
light, inorder that the fishhehadcaught might
come upeasily, and hechanted anincantation
beginning thus,—
*'Wherefore, then, oh !Tonganui,
Dostthouhold fastsoobstinately below thereV
When hehadfinished hisincantation, there floated
up,hanging tohisline, thefishofMaui, aportion
oftheearth, ofPapa-tu-a-JSTuku. Alas !alas !their
canoe layaground.
Maui then left hisbrothers with their canoe,
andreturned tothevillage; butbefore hewent
hesaid tothem, "After Iam gone, becou-
rageous andpatient; donoteatfood until Ire-
turn,anddonot letourfishbecut ujd,butrather

fied. Iwill then return, andwecan cutup

share ofit,andreturn toyourhomes joyfully;and
whatweleave behind uswillkeep good, andthat
which wetakeaway with us,returning, willbe
good too/'
Maui hadhardly gone, after saying allthis to
them, than hisbrothers trampled under their feetthe
words theyhadheard him speak. They began at
once toeatfood,and tocutupthe fish.When they
did this,Maui hadnotyetarrived atthesacred
place, inthepresence, ofthegod;hadhepreviously
reached thesacred place, theheart ofthedeity
would have been appeased with theoffering ofa
portion ofthe fishwhich hadbeen caught byhis
disciples, and allthemaleandfemale deities would
have partaken oftheir portions ofthe sacrifice.
Alas !alas !those foolish, thoughtless brothers ofhis
cutupthe fish,andbehold thegods turned with
wrath upon them, onaccount ofthe fishwhich
theyhadthus cutupwithout having made afit-
ting sacrifice. Then, indeed, the fishbegan totoss
about hishead fi^om side toside,and tolash his
tail,andthefinsupon hisback, andhislower jaw.
Ah !ah !welldone Tangaroa, itsprings about on
shore asbriskly asifitwasinthewater.

hadnotacted sodeceitfully, thehuge fishwould
have lain flatandsmooth, andwould have re-
mained asamodel fortherestoftheearth, forthe
present generation ofmen. This, which hasjust
been recoimted, isthesecond evilwhich took place
after theseparation ofHeaven from Earth.
Thus wasdryland fished upbyMaui after it
hadbeen hidden under theocean byEangi and
Tawhiri-ma-tea. Itwaswith anenchanted fish-
hook that hedrew itup,which waspointed with
abitofthejaw-bone ofhisancestress Muri-ranga-
whenua ;and inthe district ofHeretaunga they
stillshow thefish-hook ofMaui, which became a
cape stretching faroutintothesea,andnowforms
thesouthern extremity ofHawke's Bay.
Theheronowthought thathewould extinguish
anddestroy the fires ofhisancestress ofMahu-ika.
Sohegotupinthenight, andputoutthefires
leftinthecooking-houses ofeach family inthe
village;then, quite early inthemorning, hecalled
aloud totheservants, "Ihunger, Ihunger;quick,
cook some food forme.'' One oftheservants
thereupon ranasfastashecould tomake upthe
fire tocooksome food, butthe firewasout ;and
asheranround from house tohouse inthevillage

When Maui's mother heard this, shecalled out

mygreat ancestress Mahu-ika ;tellherthat fire
hasbeen lostupon earth, andaskhertogivesome
totheworld again/' Buttheslaves were alarmed,
andrefused toobey thecommands which theirmas-
ters, thesacred oldpeople, gavethem;andthey
persisted inrefusing togo,notwithstanding theold
people repeatedly ordered them todoso.
Atlast,Maui said tohismother, "Well ;then
Iwill fetchdown firefortheworld;butwhich is
thepathbywhich Imust goVAnd hisparents,
whoknew thecountry well, said tohim, "Ifyou

and thatyou arefond ofdeceiving andinjuring

ways, todeceive this old ancestress ofyours,

ButMaui said, "No, Ionlywant tobring fire

soon asIcandothat?" Then hewent, and
reached theabode ofthegoddess offire ;andhe

wasSOfilled withwonder atwhat hesaw, that for
alongtimehecould saynothing. Atlasthesaid,
"Oh,lady,would you riseup?Where isyour fire

Then theaged lady rose right up,and said,

Then theagedwoman pulled outher nail;

shegave ittohim. Andwhen Mauisawshehad

shecaught hold ofanother nail,andpulled itout

then hewent back toheragain, and said, "Oh,

toherself atlast, "This fellow issurely playing

Then outshepulled theonetoe-nail that shehad

And shecried outtoMaui, "There, youhave itall

and the firewasquenched;and before Mahuika
could reach herplace ofshelter, shealmost perished
inthe rain,andhershrieks and screams became

Maui hadayoung sister named Hinauri, who
was exceedingly beautiful ;shemarried Irawaru.
OnedayMaui and hisbrother-in-law wentdown to

hishook, which hadnobarb toit,butaslong as
theywent onfishing Maui observed thatIrawaru
continued catching plenty offish ;sohethought to
himself, "Well,how isthis?how does that fellow
catch somany whilst Icannot catch one ?"Just as
hethought this,Irawaru hadanother bite,andup

Maui,whowasalready provoked athisown ill-

called outquite angrily, "Come, letgomy line,

"No, itisnot, itisonmine.''
Maui again called outvery angrily, "Come, let

Irawaru then slacked outhis line,and letMaui

andthey allstarted withMaui intheevening, and
arrived atthedwelling ofHine-nui-te-po, and
found her fast asleep.
Then Maui addressed them all,and said, "My

Now quitting thedeeds ofMaui, letthose ofTa-

faroutinto thesea ;hehad four brothers-in-law,
twoofthesewhen tired offishing returned towards
their village, andhewent withthem;when they
drew near the village, 'they attempted tomurder
him,andthinking theyhad slain him,buried him;
they thenwent ontheirway tothe village, and
when they reached it,theiryoung sister said to
them,"Why, where isyour brother-in-law?" and
they rephed, "Oh, they're allfishing/' Sothe
young wifewaited until theother two brothers
came back, andwhen they reached thevillage they
were questioned bytheiryoung sister,who asked,
""Where isyour brother-in-law?'' andthetwowho

andran offatonce tosearch forhim;and she
found where hehadbeen buried, andonexamining
him ascertained thathehadonly been insensible,
andwasnotquite dead;thenwith great difficulty
shegothimupon herback, and carried himhome
totheir house, and carefully washed hiswounds,
andstaunched thebleeding.
Tawhaki, when hehadalittle recovered, said to
her,"Fetch some wood, and light afireforme\'
and ashiswifewasgoing todothis,hesaid to
her,"Ifyou seeany tall treegrowing near you,
fell it,andbring thatwithyou forthe fire.'' His
wifewent, andsawatreegrowing such asherhus-
band spoke of;soshe felled it,andput itupon
hershoulder andbrought italong with her ;and
when shereached thehouse, sheputthewhole tree
upon the firewithout chopping itinto pieces;and
itwas thiscircumstance that ledher togivethe
name ofWahieroa (long-log-of-wood-for-the-fire) to
their first son, forTawhaki had toldhertobring
thislogofwood home, and tocallthechild after
it,thattheduty ofavenging hisfather's wrongs
might oflen berecalled tohismind.
Assoon asTawhaki hadrecovered from his
wounds, helefttheplacewhere hisfaithless brothers-
in-law lived, andwentaway taking allhisownwar-
riorsandtheir families with him,and built afor-
tified village upon thetopofavery loftymountain,


THELEGEND OFTAWHAKI. 61
where hecould easily protect himself; andthey
dwelt there. Then hecalled aloud totheGods, his
ancestors, forrevenge, andthey letthefloods of
heaven descend, andtheearthwasoverwhelmed by
thewaters and allhuman beings perished, andthe
name given tothatevent was, "Theoverwhelming
oftheMataaho," and thewhole ofthat race
perished.
When this featwas accomplished, Tawhaki and
hisyounger brother nextwent toseek revenge for
thedeath oftheir father. Itwasadifferent race
who had carried offand slain thefather ofTa-
whaki;thename ofthatracewasthePonaturi—the
country they inhabited wasunderneath thewaters,
buttheyhadalarge house onthedryland to
which they resorted tosleep atnight ;thename of
that large house was"Manawa-Tane.''
ThePonaturi had slain thefather ofTawhaki
andcarried offhisbody, buthisfather's wifethey
had carried offalive andkept asacaptive. Ta-
whaki andhisyounger brother wentupon theirway
toseek outthat people and torevenge themselves
upon them. Atlength they reached aplace from
whence they could seethehouse called Manawa-
Tane. Atthetimethey arrived near thehouse there
wasnoonethere buttheir mother, whowas sitting
near thedoor ;butthebones oftheir father were
hungupinside thehouse under itshighsloping roof.


62 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
Thewhole tribe ofthePonaturi were atthattime
intheir country under thewaters, butattheap-
proach ofnight theywould return totheir house,
toManawa-Tane.
Whilst Tawhaki andhisyounger brother Karilii
werecoming along stillatagreat distance from the
house, Tawhaki began torepeat anincantation,
andthebones ofhisfather, Hema, felttheinfluence
ofthis,andrattled loudly together where theyhung
under theroofofthehouse, forgladness, when they
heard Tawhaki repeating hisincantations ashe
came along, fortheyknew that thehour ofrevenge
hadnowcome. Asthebrothers drew nearer, their
mother, TJrutonga, heard thevoice ofTawhaki, and
shewept forgladness infront ofherchildren, who
came repeating incantations upon theirway. And
when they reached atlength thehouse, theywept
over their mother, over oldUrutonga. When they
hadended weeping, their mother said tothem,
"Mychildren, hasten toreturn hence, oryou will
both certainly perish. Thepeople who dwell here
areavery fierce andsavage race.'' Karihi said to
her,"Howlowwillthesunhave descended when
thoseyouspeak ofreturn home?'' And shereplied,
"They willreturn herewhen thesunsinks beneath
theocean." Then Karihi asked her, "What did
they saveyou alive for?" And sheanswered,
"They savedmealive that Imight watch forthe

Karihi then said tohismother, "Cannot we
hide ourselves somewhere here?"
Their mother answered, "Youhadbetter return;
youcannot hideyourselves here, thescent ofyou
willbeperceived bythem."
"But,'' said Karihi, "wewill hide ourselves
away inthethick thatch ofthehouse."
Their mother, however, answered, "'Tisofno
use,youcannot hideyourselves there."
All thistimeTawhaki satquite silent ;but
Karihi said, "Wewillhide ourselves here, forwe
know incantations which willrender usinvisible
toall."
Onhearing this, theirmother consented totheir
remaining, andattempting toavenge their father's
death. Sotheyclimbed uptotheridge-pole ofthe
house, upon theoutside oftheroof,andmade holes
inthethick layers ofreedswhich formed thethatch

single rayoflightmay shine in/'
Atlength theday closed, and thesunsank
below thehorizon, andthewhole ofthat strange
tribe leftthew^ater inabody, andascended tothe
dryland ;and,according totheircustom from time
immemorial, they sentoneoftheirnumber infront
ofthem, thathemight carefully examine theroad,
and seethat there were nohidden foeslying in
wait forthem either ontheway orintheir house.
Assoon asthis scout arrived atthethreshold of
thehouse, heperceived thescent ofTawhaki and
Karihi ;sohelifted uphisnoseandturned sniffing
allround theinside ofthehouse. Asheturned
about, hewasonthepoint ofdiscovering that
strangers were hidden there, when therestofthe
tribe(whom long security hadmade careless) came
hurrying on,andcrowding into thehouse in
thousands, sothat from thedenseness ofthe
crowd thescent ofthestrange menwas quite lost.
ThePonaturi then stowed themselves away inthe
house until itwasentirely filledupwith them, and
bydegrees theyarranged themselves inconvenient
places, and atlength allfellfast asleep.
Atmidnight Tawhaki andKarihi stoledown
from theroof ofthehouse, andfound that their
mother hadcrept outofthedoor tomeet them, so
they satatthedoorway whispering together.

Karihi thenasked hismother, "Which isthebest
way forustodestroy these people who aresleeping
here?" And their mother answered, "You had
better letthesun killthem, itsrays willdestroy
them/'
Having said this, Tatau crept into thehouse
again;presently anoldman ofthePonaturi
called outtoher,"Ho,Tatau,^Tatau, there;isit
dawn yet?" And she^answered, "No, no, itis
deep night—itislasting night ;'iisstill night;

When itwasvery near dawn, Tatau whispered
toherchildren, whowere still sitting just outside
thedoor ofthehouse, "Seethatevery chink inthe

youhave stopped upthewindow andthedoor."
"Sothey pulled them out,andthebright rays of
thesuncame streaming into thehouse, and the
whole ofthePonaturi perished before the light;
they perished notbythehand ofman,butwithered
before thesun's rays.*
When thePonaturi hadbeen alldestroyed,
Tawhaki andKarihi carefully tookdown their
father's bones from theroof ofthehouse, and
burnt them with fire,andtogether with thebodies
ofallthosewhowere inthe house, whohad
perished, scorched bythebright rays ofthesun;
they then returned again totheirown country,
taking withthem their mother, and carefully car-

From that time Tango-tango,* the girlofthe

them ascompanions fortheir journey.
When they reached thepathway along which

When they were allgoing atearlydawn to

patiently and silently along with them, carrying

After shehad lived with thesetwo brothers for
along time, Ihuwareware went topayavisit to
hissuperior chief, Tinirau, and torelate thead-
ventui-es which hadhappened ;andwhen Tinirau
heard allthathadtaken place, hewent tobring

shewasgiven uptohim ;butbefore shewasso
given tohim, shehadconceived achildbyIhu-
atamai, andwhen shewent tolivewith Tinirau it
wasnear thetimewhen thechild should beborn.
Tinirau took herhome withhimtohisresidence
onanisland called Motu-tapu :hehadtwoother
wives living there—they were thedaughters of
Mangamanga-i-atua, and their names were Hara-
taunga andHorotata. Now,when these twowo-

could notendure it,andthey aibused Hinauri on
account ofherconduct with theirhusband ;atlast
they proceeded sofarastoattempt tostrike her,

alone.
Allthistime Hinauri was lost toherfriends
andhome, andheryoung brother Mauimua, after-
wards called Rupe, could donothing butthink of
her;andexcessive love forhis sister, andsorrow
atherdeparture, soharassed him, thathesaidhe
could nolonger remain atrest, butthathemust
goandseek forhissister.
Sohedeparted upon thisundertaking, andvisited
every place hecould think ofwithout missing
oneofthem, yetcould henowhere find hissister;
atlast,Rupe thought thathewould ascend tothe
heavens toconsult hisgreat ancestor Rehua, who
dwelt there ataplace named TePutahi-nui-o-
Rehua, and infulfilment ofthis design hebegan
hisascent totheheavenly regions.
Rupe continued hisascent, seeking everywhere
hastily forRehua;atlast,hereached aplacewhere
people were dwelling, andwhen hesawthem, he*
spoke tothem, saying, "Are theheavens above
this inhabited Vand thepeople dwelling there
answered him, "They are inhabited.'" And he
again asked them, "Can Ireach those heavens ?'^
andthey replied, "You cannot reach them, the

heavens above these arethose theboundaries of
which were fixedbyTane/'
ButRupe forced awayupthrough those
heavens, and gotabove them, andfound anin-
habited place;andheasked theinhabitants ofit,
saying, "Are theheavens above these inhabited?"
and thepeople answered him, "They areinha-
bited/' And heagain asked, "Doyouthink I
canreachthem?" andthey replied, "No,you will
notbeable toreach them, those heavens were fixed
therebyTane."
Rupe, however, forced away through those
heavens too,andthushecontinued todountil he
reached thetenth heaven, andthere hefound the
abode ofRehua. When Rehua sawastranger
approaching, hewent forward andgave liim the
usual welcome, lamenting overhim ;Rehua made
hislamentation without knowing who thestranger
was,butRupe inhislament made useofprayers
bywhich heenabled Rehua toguesswhohewas.
When theyhadeach ended their lamentation,
Rehua called tohisservants, "Light afire,and
getevery tiling ready forcooking food."" The
slaves soonmade the fireburn upbrightly, and
brought hollow calabashes, allready tohave food
placed inthem, and laidthemdown before Rehua.
AllthistimeRupewaswondering whence thefood

wastocomefromwithwhich thecalabashes, which
theslaves hadbrought, were tobefilled ;butpre-
sently heobserved thatRehua wasslowly loosen-
ingthethick bands which enveloped hislocks
around andupon thetopofhishead ;andwhen
hislong locks allfloated loosely, heshook the
dense masses ofhishair,andforth fromthemcame
flying flocks oftheTui birds, which hadbeen
nestling there, feeding upon insects;and asthey
flew forth, theslaves caught and killed them, and
filled thecalabashes with them, andtookthem
tothe fire,andputthem ontocook, andwhen
theywere done, they carried them and laidthem
before Rupe asapresent, andthen placed them
beside him that hemight eat,andRehua re-
quested him toeatfood, butRupe answered him,
"Nay, but Icannot eatthis food ;Isaw these
birds loosened andtakewing from thy locks;
whowould dare toeatbirds thathad fedupon
insects inthysacred head?'' For thereasons
hethus stated, Rupe feared thatman ofancient
days,andthecalabashes stillstood nearhimun-
touched.
At last,Rupe ventured toaskRehua, saying,
"Rehua, hasaconfused murmur ofvoices fi:om

garding which Iaminterested ?"AndRehua an-
swered him, "Yes, such amurmuring ofdistant

When Rupe heard this,heimmediately byhis
enchantments changed himself into apigeon, and

here isyour brother-in-law;'' andherhusband said
inreply,"What ishisname?'' and sheanswered,
"Itismybrother Rupe." Ithappened thatupon
thisvery day,Hinauri's little childwasborn, then
Rupe repeated thisform ofgreeting tohis sister,
thename ofwhich isToetoetu:—
"Hinauri,

Hardly had hisyoung sister finished repeating

the infant, carrying with them theplacenta to

placenta wasaccidentally dropped, and falling into
the sea,wasdevoured byashark, and this cir-
cumstance waswhat caused themultitude of
large eggswhich arenowfound intheinside of
theshark.
Atlength thebrother and sister arrived atthe
dwelling place ofRehua, which was called TePu-
tahi-nui-o-Rehua. The oldmanwas unable to
keep hiscourt-yard clean forhimself, and his
people neglected todosofrom idleness;thus itwas
leftinavery filthy state. Rupe, whowas dis-
pleased atseeing this,onedaysaid toRehua, "Oh,
Rehua, they leave this court-yard ofyours ina
very filthy state;'' andthen headded, "Your
people aresuchasetoflazy rogues, that ifevery
mess ofdirtwasalizard, Idoubt ifthey could

Atlast,Rupe thought thathecould clean and
beautify, insome respects, Rehua's dwelling forhim,

THELEGEND OFKAE'S THEFT OF
THEWHALE.
Soon afterTulmruhuru was born, Tinirau endea-
voured tofindaskilful magician, whomight per-
form thenecessary enchantments andincantations
torender thechild afortunate andsuccessful war-
rior,andKaewasthename oftheoldmagician,
whom some ofhisfriends brought tohim forthis
purpose. InduetimeKaearrived atthevillage
where Tinirau lived, andheperformed theproper
enchantments with fitting ceremonies overtheinfant.
When allthese things hadbeen rightly con-
cluded, Tinirau gave asignal toapetwhale that
hehadtamed, tocome onshore;thiswhale's name
wasTutunui. When itknew that itsmaster wanted
it,itlefttheocean inwhich itwassporting about,
andcame totheshore, and itsmaster laidhold of
it,andcutaslice ofitsflesh ofi"tomake afeast
fortheoldmagician, andhecooked it,andgave a
jDortion ofittoKae,who found itvery savoury,
and praised thedishverymuch.
Shortly afterwards, Kae said itwasnecessary for
himtoreturn tohisown village, which wasnamed
TeTihi-o-Manono ;soTinirau ordered acanoe tobe
gotready forhim totakehimback, butKaemade


KAES THEFT OFTHEWHALE. 91
excuses, andsaidhedidnotliketogoback inthe
canoe, andremained where hewas. This,however,
wasamere trick upon hispart, hisreal object
being togetTinirau topermit him togobackupon
thewhale, upon Tutunui, forhenowknewhow
savoury the flesh ofthat fishwas.
AtlastTinirau lentTutunui totheoldmagician
tocarryhimhome, buthegavehimvery particular
directions, telling him, "When yougetsonear the
shore, thatthefishtouches thebottom, itwillshake
itself toletyouknow, andyoumast then, without
anydelay,jump ofi*itupon theright side.''
Hethenwished Kae farewell, andtheoldmagi-
cian started, andawaywent thewhale through the
water with him.
When theycame close totheshore atKae's vil-
lage,andthewhale feltthebottom, itshook itself
asasign toKae tojump off"andwade ashore, but
itwas ofnouse;theoldmagician stuck fast to
thewhale, andpressed itdown against thebottom
ashard ashecould ;invain the fishcontinued
toshake itself; Kae heldonto it,andwould not
jump off",and initsstruggles theblow-holes of
Tutunui gotstopped upwith sand, and ifcdied.
Kaeand hispeople thenmanaged todragupthe
body ofTutunui onshore, intending tofeastupon
it;and this circumstance became afterwards the
cause ofawar against that tribe,whowere called
''The descendants ofPoporokewa.'' When they


92 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
haddragged Tutunui onshore, they cut itsbody-
upandcooked itinovens, covering the fleshup
with thefragrant leaves oftheKoromiko before
theyheaped earth upon theovens, andthefatof
Tutunui adliered totheleaves oftheKoromiko, and
theycontinue greasy tothisday, sothat ifKoromiko
boughs areputupon the fireandbecome greasy,
theproverb says—"There's some ofthesavouriness
ofTutunui."
Tinirau continued anxiously tolook forthere-
turn ofTutunui, andwhen alongtimehadelapsed
without itscoming back again, hebegan tosayto
himself, "Well, Iwonder wheremywhale canbe
stopping !"Butwhen Kaeand hispeople had
cooked the flesh ofthewhale, andtheovens were
opened, asavoury scentwaswafted across thesea
toTinirau, andbothheand hiswifesmelt itquite
plainly, andthen theyknew very well thatKae
hadkilled thepetwhich theyhadtamed fortheir
little darling Tuhuruhuru, andthathehadeaten it.
Without any delay, Tinirau's people dragged
down totheseaalarge canoe which belonged to
oneofhiswives, andfortywomen forthwith em-
barked init;nonebutwomen went, asthiswould
beless likely toexcite anysuspicion inKae that
theyhadcome with ahostile object ;amongst them
were Hine-i-te-iwaiwa, E-aukatauri, Raukatamea,
Itiiti, Rekareka, andRua-hau-a-Tangaroa, andother
females ofnote,whose names have notbeen pre-

served;just before thecanoe started, Tinirau's
youngest sister asked liim, "What arethemarks
byAvhich weshallknow KaeVandheanswered
her, "Oh,youcannot mistake him, histeeth are
uneven and alloverlap oneanother/'
Well,away they paddled, and induetime they
arrived atthevillage oftheoldmagician Kae,and
histribe allcollected toseethestrangers ;towards
night, when itgrew dark, afirewas lighted in
thehouse ofKae,andacrowd collected inside it,
until itwas filled ;one sidewas quite occupied
with thecrowd ofvisitors, and theother sideof
thehouse with thepeople ofKae's tribe. Theold
magician himself satatthefootofthemain pillar
which supported theroof ofthehouse, andmats
were laiddown there forhim tosleepon(butthe
strangers didnotyetknow which wasKae, forit
didnotaccord with theMaori's rules ofpoliteness
toaskthenames ofthechiefs, itbeing supposed
fi:om theirfameandgreatness thatthey areknown
byeverybody).
Inorder tofind outwhich wasKae, Tinirau's
people hadarranged, thattheywould trybywit
andfuntomake everybody laugh, andwhen the
people opened theirmouths, towatch which ofthem
haduneven teeth that lapped across oneanother,
andthus discover which wasKae.
Inorder, therefore, tomake them laugh, Eauka-
tauri exhibited allheramusing tricks andgames;


94 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
shemade them singandplayupon the flute, and
upon theputorino, andbeat timewith castanets
ofbone andwood whilst they sang ;andthey
played atiiuora, andthekind oftiinwhichmany
motions aremade with thefingers andhands, and
thekind oftiinwhich, whilst theplayers sing,
theyrapidly throw short sticks tooneanother, keep-
ingtime tothetunewhich they aresinging;andshe
played upon aninstrument likeajew's-harp for
them, andmade puppets dance, andmade them all
sing whilst they played with large whizgigs;and
after theyhaddone allthese things, themanthey
thought wasKaehadnever even once laughed.
Then thepartywhohadcome from Tinirau's,
allbegan toconsult together, andtosaywhat can
wedotomake that fellow laugh, and foralong
time they thought ofsome planbywhich they
might takeKae in,andmake himlaugh;atlast
theythought ofone,which was, thatthey should
allsing adroll comic song; sosuddenly they all
began tosing together, atthesame timemaking
most curious faces, andshaking their hands and
arms intime tothetune.
When theyhadended their song, theoldmagi-
cian could nothelp laughing outquite heartily,
and thosewhowerewatching him closely atonce
recognised him, forthere theysaw pieces ofthe
flesh ofTutunui still sticking between histeeth,
and histeeth were uneven and alloverlapped one

another. From this circumstance aproverb has
been preserved among theMaories tothepresent
day—forifanyoneonlistening toastory told
byanother isamused atitandlaughs, oneofthe
bystanders says,"Ah, there 'sKae laughing.''
Nosooner didthewomen whohadcome from
Tinirau's seetheflesh ofTutunui sticking inRace's
teeth than theymade anexcuse forletting the fire
burn dimly inthehouse, saying, thattheywanted
togotosleep—their real object, however, being to
beable toperform their enchantments without
being seen ;buttheoldmagician, who suspected
something, tooktworound pieces ofmother-of-pearl
shell,andstuck oneinthesocket ofeach eye,so
thatthestrangers, observing thefaint rays oflight
reflected from thesurface ofthemother-of-pearl,
might think theysawthewhite ofhiseyes,and
thathewas stillawake.
Thewomen from Tinirau's went on,however,
with their enchantments, andbytheir magical arts
threw every one inthehouse intoanenchanted
sleep, with theintention, when theyhaddone this,
ofcarrying offKaebystealth. Sosoon asKae
andthepeople inthehouse were alldeep inthis
enchanted sleep, thewomen ranged themselves ina
longrow, thewholewayfrom theplacewhere Kae
was sleeping down totheir canoe;they allstood
inastraight line,with alittle interval between

ontotw^o others, andthus theyhanded himon
from onetoanother, until heatlastreached the
arms ofthetwowomen whowere standinof inthe
canoe ready toreceive him;andthey laidhim
down very gently inthecanoe, fast asleep ashe
was;and thus theoldmagician Kaewascarried
offbyHine-i-te-iwaiwa andRaukatauri.
When thewomen reached thevillage ofTinirau
intheir canoe, they again tookupKae,andcarried
himvery gently uptothehouse ofTinirau, and
laidhimdown fastasleep close tothecentral pillar,
which supported theridge-pole ofthehouse, so
that theplacewhere heslept inthehouse ofTini-
rauwasexactly like hissleeping-place inhisown
house. Thehouse ofKae was, however, alarge
circular house, without aridge-pole, butwith raft-
ersspringing from thecentral pillar, running down
like rays tolow side posts inthecircular wall;
whilst thehouse ofTinirau wasalong house, with
aridge-pole running theentire length oftheroof,
and resting upon the pillar initscentre.
When Tinirau heard that theoldmagician had
been brought tohisvillage, hecaused orders tobe


kae's theft ofthewhale, 97
given toliistribe thatwhen hemade hisappear-
ance inthemorning, going tothehouse where Kae
was, they should allcalloutloud, "Here comes
Tinirau, herecomes Tinirau,'' asifhewascoming
asavisitor intothevillage ofKae, sothat theold
magician onhearing them might think thathewas
stillathome.
Atbroad daylight next morning, when Tinirau's
people sawhim passing along througli thevillage
towards hishouse, they allshouted aloud, "Here
comes Tinirau, herecomes Tinirau;''andKae,who
heard the cries, started upfrom hisenchanted
sleep quite drowsy and confused, whilst Tinirau
passed straight on,and satdown just outside the
door ofhishouse, sothat hecould look into it,
and, looking in,hesawKae, and saluted him,
saying, "Salutations toyou,OKae !"andthenhe
asked him, saying, "How came youhereVand
theoldmagician replied, "Nay, butrather how
cameyouhere ?"
Tinirau replied, "Just look, then, atthehouse,
and see ifyou recognise it?''

named Tuwhakararo, andafterwards toadaughter

afterwards her last childwasborn, and itsname
wasReimatua.
When Mairatea grew up,shewasmarried tothe

tohishome ;butTuwhakararo remained athisown

Maurea, took agreat fancy tohim,andshowed
that shehked him, although, atthevery time, she
wascarrying onacourtship with another young
man oftheAti-Hapai tribe.
AVhilst Tuwhakararo wasonthis visit tohis
brother-in-law, some oftheyoung men oftheAti-
Hapai tribe asked himoneday towrestle with
them, and he,agreeing tothis, stood uptowrestle,
andtheonewhocame forward ashiscompetitor
was thesweetheart ofhisbrother-in-law's young
sister. Tuwhakararo laidhold oftheyoung man,
andsoongavehimasevere fall.Thatmatch being
over, theyboth stood upagain, andTuwhakararo,
lifting him inhisarms, gavehimanother severe
fall ;and allthe3^oung people oftheAti-Hapai
tribe burst outlaughing attheyouth, forhaving
hadtwosuchheavy fallsfrom Tuwhakararo, and
hesatdown upon theground, looking very foolish,
andfeeling exceedingly sulky andprovoked atbeing
laughed atbyeverybody.
Tuwhakararo, having alsofinished wrestling, sat
down too,andbegan toputonhisclothes again,

toease theanguish ;the3^oung manthen struck
Jiimonthehead, and killed him. Thepeople of
theAti-Hapai tribe then raninuponhimandcut
hisbody up,andafterwards devoured it;andthey
took hisbones, andhung them upinthe roof,
under the ridge-pole oftheir liouse TeUru-o-
Manono.
Whilst theywerehung upthere thebones rat-
tled together, and his sister heard them, and it
seemed toherasiftheymade asound like "Taupa-
roro, Tauparoro;'' andshelistened again tothe
rattling ofthebones, andagain sheheard the
words "Tauparoro, Tauparoro/' And thesister of
Tawhakararo looking uptothebones, said, "You
rattle invain, bones ofhimwhowasdevoured
bytheAti-Hapai tribe, forwho isthere tolament

Atlastthenews ofthesadevent which had
taken place reached theears ofhisbrother, Wha-
katau-potiki, and ofhisother brothers, andwhen
they heard itthey were grieved and pained at
thefate oftheir brother, and atlastWhakatau-
potiki adopted afirm resolution togoandavenge
Tawhakararo's death, and astherestofhistribe
agreed inthispurpose, theybegan without delay to
build canoes foritsexecution.
Theynamed some oftheir canoes theWhiritoa,

lashing onthetop-boards oftheir canoes, their
mother Apakura, with allherfemale attendants,

inbeating andpreparing fern root forthewar
partywhowere about tostart torevenge the
death ofTuwhakararo, theykept onrepeating a
lament fortheyoung manwhich might rouse the
feelings ofthewarriors.
Lo,thearmy ofWhakatau-potiki nowembarked;
they started inathousand canoes, and floated out
intotheopen sea,andproceeding upon their course,
theylanded atacertain placewhich layintheir
route, andthere thearmy ofWhakatau hadare-
view, toshowhow well they could gothrough
their manoeuvres. Theywereformed intocolumns,
andonecolumn, with fierce shouts and yells, after
awardance, sprang upon thesupposed enemy, and
whilst theywere thusengaged with theirimaginary
foe,asecond column, with wild cries, advanced to
their support;then the firstcolumn ofwarriors
retired tore-form, andthuscolumn after column
feigned tocharge their foes.

Then onebody ofthewarriors rushed toan
adjoining creek and tried tojump across it,but
they could not.Aband ofmen under Wha-
katau's immediate command were sitting upon
theground watching the others, andwhen the
firstbody gave upindespair allthoughts of
overleaping the creek, tliischosen band ofWha-
katau rose from theground, started forward,
reached ingood order theedge ofthe creek, and
sprang easily across it(thewhole body ofthem to
theother side).
When thereview wasended, Whakatau made a
speech tothewarriors, saying, "Warriors, allofyou
listen tome.Wewillnotfinish ourvoyage until
thedark night, lestweshould beseenbythepeople

Just asitwasdark,Whakatau ordered hisown
chosen band ofwarriors togoand pulltheplugs
outofallthecanoes buttheir own, and they, in
obedience tohisorders, went round andpulled all
theplugs outofthecanoes, andthus they didto
thewhole ofthem without missing asingle canoe

Thishaving been done,Whakatau called aloud
tothewhole force, "Nowmymen, letusem-

sprang cheerfully into theirown canoes;but lo,
presently thecanoes allbegan tosink, oneafter the
other, andthecrews were compelled again toseek
theshore, andtobusy themselves there inrepairing
them. Inthemeantime thechosen band ofwarriors
ofWbakatau urged ontheir canoes, leaving theothers
behind, andwhen theydrew near theplacewhere
thehouse called theUru-o-Manono wassituated, they
landed. Then thewarriors silently surrounded the
house inranks throughout itswhole circumference,
andeach oftheeight doors ofthehouse they
guarded byaband ofmen,andWhakatau laidhold
ofamannamed Hioi,whom theycaught outside of
thehouse, andhequestioned him, saying, "Where
ismysisternowVAndHioianswered him, "She
isinthehouse.'^ And heasked him again, "In
what part ofthehouse doesPoporokewa sleep?"
Hioi replied, "Atthefootofthelarge pillar which
supports theridge-pole ofthehouse.'" Whakatau
next asked, "Hasheany distinguishing mark by
which wemayknow him?'' Hioianswered, "You
mayknow himbyoneofhisteeth being broken."
Whakatau asked himonequestion more, saying,
"Inwhat part ofthehouse doesmysister sleep?"
AndHioianswered him, "Shesleeps close tothat

Whakatau-potiki asked himnofurther questions,

buttook thefellow andcutouthistongue, and
when hehaddone sohemadehim talk,andhestill
spoke quite distinctly, although agreat part ofliis
tongue was cut out. Whakatau then tookhim
again, andcuthistongue offquite close totheroot,
andhemade him trytotalk again, andnothing
butanindistinct mumbling could beheard, sohe
then ordered theman into thehouse tosend his
sister out tohim.
Hioiwent ashewas told tosendWhakatau's
sister tohim, forshewasthen intheUru-o-Manono,
thehouse ofherfather-in-law, Poporokewa. When
hegotinside, thewhole mass oftheAti-Hapai tribe

them asked himwhere hehadbeen to,andwhat
hehadgone for ;butwhat was theuseoftheir

Butthesister ofWhakatau guessed inamoment
that thiswassome device ofherbrother's, and at
oncewent outofthehouse, andfound Whaka-

from joyattheir meeting, partly from sorrow in
thinking ofthemelancholy death oftheir brother

footofthelarge pillar which supports theridge-pole

brother, agreat part oftheAti-Hapai tribehave
seenyou before, andthey willknow you/' Her
brother thenasked her, "What thendoyouthink I
hadbetter do?"His sister answered, "Youhad
better cutyour hairquite short todisguise yourself.
Heconsented tothisbeing done, sohis sister
cuthishair quite close forhim,andwhen shehad
done thissherubbed hisface alloverwith charcoal,
andthen heand hissisterwent together intothe
house. The fire.inthehouse hadgotquite low
some time before, andwhen they entered, thepeo-
plenearwhere theywent in,cried out,"Make
upthe fire,make up the fire ;here 'sa

the fireandmade itburn brightly, andmany of
them came toseeWhakatau-potiki, andwhen they
hadlooked well athim, they broke outlaughing,
and said,"What ablack-looking fellow heis!"
EvenPoporokewa burst outlaughing athisappear-
ance, andWhakatau, when hesawhim laugh, at
oncerecognised himbyhisbroken tooth.
Whakatau-potiki hadtaken astout rope with

repeating apowerful incantation.
Then eachwarrior sprang upinto hisplace from
theground, onwhich theyhadbeen lyingdown to
conceal themselves, andthey set firetothehouse
inseveral places atonce, andslaughtered allthose
who tried toescape. Thus theyburnt theTJru-o-

THELEGEND OFRATA,
HISADVENTURES WITH THEENCHANTED TREEANDREVENGE
OFHISfather's murder.
Befoee Tawliaki ascended upinto theheavens, a
sonnamed Wahieroa hadbeenborn tohimbyhis
first wife. Assoon asWahieroa grew toman's
estate, hetookKura forawife,andsheborehim
asonwhom they called Rata. Wahieroa was slain
treacherously byachiefnamed Matukutakotako,
but hissonRatawasbornsome time before his
death. Ittherefore became hisduty torevenge
thedeath ofhisfather Wahieroa, andRata having
gTOwn up,atlastdevised aplan fordoing this; he
therefore gave thenecessary orders tohisdependants,
atthesame time saying tothem, "Iamabout to
goinsearch ofthemanwhoslewmy fatlier.''
Hethen started upon ajourney forthispurpose,
andatlength arrived attiieentrance totheplace
ofMatukutakotako ;hefound there amanwho
was leftincharge ofit,sitting attheentrance to
thecourt-yard, andheasked him, saying, "Where
isthemanwho killedmyfather?''Themanwho

was leftincharge oftheplace answered him—
"Helivesbeneath intheearth there, and Iamleft
herebyhim, tocalltohimandwarn himwhen
thenewmoon appears;atthatseason herisesand
comes forth upon theearth, anddevours men as

Ratathen said tohim, "Allthatyousay istrue,

forhim toriseupfrom theearth?" Theman re
plied, "Icallaloud tohim/'
Then said Rata,"When will there beanew

oftheplace answered him, "Intwonights hence.
Doyounowreturn toyourown village, butonthe
morning ofthesecond dayfrom thistimecome
here again tome/'
Rata, incompliance with these directions, re-
turned tohisown dwelling, andwaited there
until thetime that had been appointed him,
andonthemorning ofthatdayheagain jour-
neyed along theroad hehadpreviously travelled,
andfound theman sitting inthesame place,
andheasked him, saying, "Doyouknow anyspot
where Icanconceal myself, and liehidfrom the
enemy withwhom Iamabout tofight, fromMa-
tukutakotako?" Theman replied, "Come with
meuntil Ishowyou thetwo fountains ofclear
water."


110 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
They thenwent togetlier until theycame tothe
twofountains.
Themanthen said toRata, "The spot thatwe
stand onistheplacewhere Matuku risesupfrom
theearth, andyonder fountain istheoneinwhich
hecombs andAvashes hisdishevelled hair, butthis
fountain istheoneheuses toreflect hisface

whilst he isatthefountain heuses toreflect
hisface in,because yourshadow would bealso
reflected in it,andhewould see it ;but atthe
fountain inwhich hewashes hishair,youmay
smite andslayhim/'
Rata then asked theman, "Will hemake his
appearance from theearth this evening?'' And
themananswered, "Yes/"
They hadnotwaited long there,when evening
arrived, andthemoon became visible, andtheman
said toRata,"Doyounowgoandhide yourself
near thebrink ofthefountain inwhich hewashes
hishair;"andRatawent andhidhimself near
theedge ofthefountain, andthemanwhohad
been lefttowatch forthepurpose shouted aloud,
"Ho,Ho, thenewmoon isvisible—amoon two
days old." AndMatukutakotako heard liim,and
seizing histwo-handed wooden sword, herose
upfrom theearth there, andwent straight tohis
twofountains;thenhelaiddown histwo-handed

fountain where hedressed liis hair, andkneeling
down onboth knees beside it,heloosened the
strings which bound uphislong locks, andshook
outhisdishevelled hair,andplunged down his-head
intothecool clear waters ofthefountain. SoRata
creeping outfromwhere helayhid,rapidly moved
up,andstood behind him,andasMatuku-takotako
raised hishead from thewater, Rata with one
hand seized himbythehair, while with theother
hesmote andslewhim;thusheaveuged thedeath
ofhisfather Wahieroa.
Rata thenasked themanwhom liehadfound in
charge oftheplace, "Where shall Ifindthebones
ofWahieroa myfatherVAnd thekeeper ofthe
place answered him, "They arenothere; astrange
people who live atadistance came and carried
them off."
Upon hearing this.Rata returned to.hisown
village, andthere reflected overmany designs by
which hemight recover thebones ofhisfather.
Atlength hethought ofanexcellent plan for
thispurpose, soliewent intotheforest andhaving
found avery tall tree, quite straight throughout its
entire length, hefelled it,andcut off*itsnoble branch-
ingtop,intending tofashion thetrunk intoacanoe;
and allthe insects which inhabit trees, and the
spirits oftlieforests, were veryangry atthis,and

assoon asRatahadreturned tothevillage ateven-
ing,when hisday'sworkwasended, they allcame
andtook the tree,and raised itupagain, andthe
innumerable multitude ofinsects, birds, and spirits,
who arecalled"Theoffspring ofHakuturi," worked
away atreplacing each little chipandshaving in
itsproper place, andsang aloud their incantations
astheyworked;thiswaswhat theysangwith a
confused noise ofvarious voices:—
Flytogether, chips andshavings,
Stick yefasttogether,
Hold yefasttogether;
Stand upright again, tree !
Early thenextmorning backcame Rata, intend-
ingtowork athewing thetrunk ofhistreeintoa
canoe. When hegottotheplacewhere hehad
leftthetrunk lying ontheground, atfirst he
could noi^find it,and ifthat fine tallstraight tree,
which hesawstanding whole andsound inthe
forest, was thesame hethought hehad cut
down, there itwasnow erect again ;however
hestepped upto it,andmanfully hewing away

itbecame toodark towork, liereturned tohis

Assoon asliewas gone, back came theinnu-
merable multitudes ofinsects, birds, and spirits,
who arecalled theoffspring ofHakuturi, andthey
raised upthetreeupon itsstump once more, and
with aconfused noise ofvarious voices, they sang
incantations asthey woj^ked, andwhen theyhad
ended these, thetreeagain stood sound asever in
itsformer place inthe forest.
Themorning dawned, andRata returned once
more towork athiscanoe. When hereached the
place, wasnotheamazed toseethetreestanding
upintheforest, untouched, just ashehad atfirst
found it?But he,nothing daunted, hewsaway atit

went offasifgoing home, andthen turned back
andhidhimself intheunderwood, inaspotwhence
hecould peep outand seewhat took place;hehad
notbeen hidden long,when heheard theinnumer-
ablemultitude ofthechildren ofTane approach-
ingthe spot, singing their incantations asthey

where thetreewaslyingupon theground. Lo,a

thechildren ofTane allcried aloud inreply,—
"Who gaveyouauthority tofelltheforest godto

When Rata heard them say this,hewas quite
overcome withshame atwhat hehaddone.
Theoffspring ofTane again allcalled outaloud
tohim—"Return, Rata, tothy village, wewill
make acanoe foryou."
Rata, without delay, obeyed their orders, andas
soon ashehadgone they allfelltowork; theywere
sonumerous, andunderstood eachwhat todoso
well, that theynosooner began toadze outa
canoe than itwas completed. When theyhad
done this.Rataand histribe lostnotime inhaul-
ing itfrom theforest tothewater, and thename
theygave tothatcanoe wasRiwaru.
When thecanoe was afloat upon the sea,140
warriors embarked onboai^d it,andwithout delay
theypaddled offtoseek their foes;onenight, just
atnightfall, theyreached thefortress oftheir ene-
mies,whowerenamed Ponaturi. When they arrived
there. Rata alone landed, leaving thecanoe afloat
and allhiswarriors onboard ;ashestole along
theshore, hesawthatafirewasburning onthe
sacred place, where thePonaturi consulted their
godsand oflTered sacrifices tothem. Rata, without
stopping, crept directly towards the fire,andhid


THEADVENTURES OFRATA. 115
himself behind some thick bushes oftheHara-
keke ;*hethensawthat there weresome priests
upon theother sideofthesame bushes, serving at
thesacred place, and, toassist themselves intheir
magical arts, theyweremaking useofthebones
ofWahieroa, knocking them together tobeat time
while they were repeating apowerful incanta-
tion,known only tothemselves, thename of
which wasTitikura. Kata listened attentively tothis
incantation, until helearnt itbyheart, andwhen
hewasquite sure that heknew it,herushed sud-
denly upon thepriests;they, surprised and igno-
rant ofthenumbers of.their enemy, orwhence they
came, made little resistance, andwere inamoment
smitten and slain. Thebones ofhisfather Wahieroa
were then eagerly snatched upbyhim ;hehastened
withthem back tothecanoe, embarked onboard
it,andhiswarriors atoncepaddled away, striving
toreach hisfortified village.
Inthemorning some ofthePonaturi repaired
totheir sacred place, andfound their priests lying
dead there, just astheywere slainbyRata. So,
without delay, theypursued him.Athousand war-
riors oftheir tribe followed after Rata. Atlength
thisarmy reached thefortress ofRata, andanen-
gagement atoncetook place, inwhich thetribe of
Ratawasworsted, andsixty ofitswarriors slain;

116 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
atthismoment Rata betlioiiglit liimoftliespell lie
had learnt from the priests, and,immediately re-
peating thepotent incantation Titikura, hisslain
warriors werebyitspower oncemore restored to
life;then they rushed again tothecombat, and
thePonaturi were slaughtered byRata and his
tribe, athousand ofthem—thewhole thousand
were slain.
TeRata's task ofavenging hisfather's death
being thus ended, histribe hauled uphislarge
canoe ontheshore, androofed itoverwith thatch
toprotect itfrom thesunandweather. Ratanow
tookTongarautawhiri asoneofhiswives, andshe
borehim asonwhom henamed Tuwhakararo;
when thissoncame toman's estate, hetookApa-
kura asoneofhiswives, andfrom hersprang a
sonnamed Whakatau. Hewasnotborn inthe
manner that mortals are,butcame intobeing in
thisway: OnedayApakura wentdown upon the
sea-coast, andtook offalittle apron which she
wore infront asacovering, andthrew itinto the
ocean, andagodnamed Rongotakawiu took itand
shaped it,andgave itformand being, andWha-
katau sprang into life,and hisancestor Rongota-
kawiu taught himmagic andtheuseofenchant-
ments ofevery kind.
When Whakatau wasalittle lad, hisfavourite
amusement was flying kites. Mortals then often


THEADVENTURES OFRATA. 117
observed kites "flying inthe air,andconld seeno-
thing else, forWhakatau wasrunning about atthe
bottom ofthewaters, stillholding theendofthe
string ofthekite inhishands. Onedayhestole
upoutofthewater bydegrees, andatlength came
upon theshore, when thewhole ofhisbodywas
quite plainly seenbysome people whowere near,
and they ran as flist asthey could tocatch
him.When Whakatau observed them allrunning to
seize him,heslipped back again intothewater, and
continued flying hiskite asbefore; butthepeople
whohad seenhimwere surprised atthisstrange
siofht, and beino; determined tocatch him the
next time hecame out, they satdown upon the
bank towait forhim. AtlastWhakatau came
upoutofthewater again, andstepped onshore
oncemore ;then thepeople whowere watching
forhim, allranatfullspeed tocatch him.^When
Whakatau sawthem coming afterhim again, he
cried out,"Youhadbetter goandbring Apakura
here, she istheonlyperson whocancatchmeand
holdme fast.''
When theyheard this,oneofthem rantofetch
Apakura, andshecamewithhim atonce, and as
soon asshesaw littleWhakatau, shecalled outto
him,"Here Iam, IamApakura.'' Whakatau
then stopped running, andApakura caught hold of
himwith herhands, andshequestioned him, saying,


118 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
"Whom doyoubelong to?" AndWhakatau an-
swered her,"Iamyour child;youonedaythrew
the little apron which covered youonthesands of
the sea,andthegodRongotakawiu, myancestor,
formed mefrom it,andIgrewupahuman being,
andhenamed meWhakatau/'
From that timeWhakatau leftthewater and
continued toliveonshore. Hisprincipal amusement,
aslong ashewasalad,was stillflying kites ;but
heunderstood magic well,andnothing was con-
cealed from him,andwhen hegrew uptobea
man hebecame arenowned hero.
This second legend oftliedestruction byWhakatau-potiki of
thehouse called TeTihi-o-Manono, orTeUru-o-Manono, isadded,
because itdiflfers considerably from theother, and isoften alluded
toinancient poems.
Tinirau determined toattempt toavenge thedeath ofhisde-
scendant Tuwhakararo, andhethought thatthebestperson todo
thiswasWhakatau, whom heknew tobevery skilful inwar,and
inenchantments, sohedirected hiswife Hine-i-te-iwaiwa tofind
Whakatau, andshewent insearch ;when shereached avillage
nearwhere sheexpected tofind him, sheasked some people
whom she saw,where Whakatau was,andthey answered her,
"He isonthetopofyonder hillflying akite." She atonce pro-
ceeded onherAvay until shecame tothe hill,andseeing aman
there, sheasked him, "Canyou tellmewhere IcanfindWha-
katau?" andhereplied, "You must have passed him asyoucame
here." Then shereturned tothevillage where shehadseen
thepeople, andsaidtothem, "Why, themanupon the hillsays
thatWhatakau ishere;" butthey toldherthat themanwhohad
spoken tohermust havebeenWhakatau himself, andthat shehad
better return tohim,and toldhermarks bywhich shemight
knowhim ;shetherefore returned, and he,aftersome time,when
sheshowed him that sheknew certain marks about hisperson,


THEADVENTURES OFRATA. 119
admitted thathewasWhakatau ;andhethen asked herwhat
hadmade hercome tohim] andshereplied, "Tinirau sentmeto
youtoaskyoutocome and assist inrevenging thedeath ofour
near relative; thewarriors are allcollecting atthevillage of
Tinirauj butthey fear togotoattack thisenemy, for itisthe
bravest ofalltheenemies ofTinirau." Whakatau thenasked her,
"Have you yetgiven afeast tothewarriorsT'andshe said,
"N'ot yet."Hethenspoke toher, saying, "Return atonceand
when youreach your village, give agreat feast tothewarriors;
givethem abundance ofpotted birds from the forests, but letall
the oilinwhich thebirds were preserved bekept forme ;asfor
yourself, donotgotothe feast, but,decking yourhead witha
mourning dress offeathers, remain seated close inthehouse of

Shortly after hisvisitor had lefthim, "VVhakatau called aloud to
hispeople, saying, "Letthesideboards beatonce fresh lashed on
toourcanoe, tothecanoe ofourancestor ofRata." Hismenwere
soanxious tofulfil their chief's orders, thatalmost assoon as
hehadspoken theywere atwork, andbad finished thecanoe
thatvery day,anddragged itdown tothesea ;when night fell,
sixofhiswarriors embarked in it,andWhakatau made the
seventh ;they then paddled off,following adirect course, until
theyreached thevillage ofTinirau ;where theyfound Hine-i-te-
iwaiwa seated inherhouse ofmourning. Whakatau thenasked
her,"Have thewarriors allleftyet]" andshereplied, "They will
notdoit,they areafraid." Whakatau then saidtoher,"Farewell,
then ;doyouremain here untilyouhear further fromme."
Whakatau andhismenhaving re-embarked intheir canoe, made
astraight course fortheplace where wassituated thegreat house
called theTihi-o-Manono, andthey lettheir anchor drop, and
floated there.
When thenextmorning broke, andsome ofthepeople ofthe
village coming outofthehouse, andbeyond their defences, saw
thecanoe floating attheanchorage, theygave thealarm, crying
out, "Awarparty !awarparty!"Then thewarriors came
rushing forth tothefray incrowds, andarranged themselves in
bands. Then stood forth oneoftheirchampions whose name was
Mango-huritapena, andhedefied AYhakatau, whowasstanding up
inhiscanoe, calling out,"Were you foolenough, then, tocome

ingout,"Which ofthe arts ofwardoyou consider yourself
famous fori" andMango-huritapena shouted outinanswer, "I
amamost skilful diver.""Dive here, then, ifyou dare," shouted
outWhakatau inreply. Then thechampion oftheenemy gave a
plunge intothewater, anddived under it.Just ashegotright
under thecanoe, oneofWhakatau's men poured the oilwhich
Hine-i-te-iwaiwa hadgiven them intothesea,and itswaters im-
mediately became quite transparent, sothattheysawthewarrior
come floating upunder thecanoe, andAVhakatau transfixed him
with awooden spade ;sothatchampion perished.
Then forward stepped another champion named Pitakataka, and
hedefied Whakatau, shouting out, "Ah !youonly killed Mango-
huritapena because hechanced toputhimself inawrong position."
Whakatau shouted outinreply, "Which ofthearts ofwarare
you skilled in,then]" andheanswered, "Oh! Ileap soskilfully
that Iseem toflyintheair." "Then leap here, ifyou dare," an-
swered Whakatau ;andthechampion ofhisenemies took arun
andmade aspring high into the air;butWhakatau laidanoose
onthecanoe, and asthewarrior alighted init,hedrew ittight,
andcaught him asabird inaspringe, andthusslew that warrior
also.
And thus, oneafter theother, heslewtenofthemostfamous
warriors ofhisenemies ;onewhom hehad seized, hesaved
alive, buthecutouthistongue, andthen said tohim, "Now^,
offwithyou totheshore again, and tellthem therehow Ihave
overcome you all;"having done this,Whakatau retired alittle
distance back from theplace, sothat hiscanoe could notbeseen
byhisenemies.
Intheafternoon Whakatau landed onthecoast, andbefore eat-
inganything, oflTered theprescribed sacrifice ofthehairandapart
oftheskin ofthehead ofone ofhisvictims tothegods;and
when thereligious riteswere finished, heeatfood ;andhaving
done this, hedirected thepeople hehadwithhim toreturn,
saying,"Return atonce, andwhen youreach theresidence of
Hine-i-te-iwaiwa, speak toher,saying,*Whakatau toldustocome,
and tellyou,thathecould notreturn with us ;'andhefurther
said,'Ifheavy rain falls inlarge drops, itisasignthat Ihavebeen

and that Ihave burnt theTihio-Manono ;'healso said thathe
wished youtositupon theroof ofyour house watching until you
sawtheTihi-o-Manono burnt." Whakatau's people atoncereturned
toHine-i-te-iwaiwa todeliver themessage hehadgiven them.
Just before nightfall, Whakatau drew nearthegreat house, called
theTihi-o-Manono, and asthepeople ofWhitinakonako, agreat
chief, were collecting firewood attheedge ofaforest, hestealthily
dropped inamongst them, pretending tobecollecting firewood too;
and astheywere going home with their loads offirewood upon
their backs, hemanaged topushoninfront ofthem, andgotinto

Bythistime thepeople wholived inthehouse allcame crowd-

When their fireshadburnt upbrightly, some ofthem called outto
Mango-Pare, themanwhom Whakatau hadsaved alive, andwhose
tongue hehadcutout,"Well, now, telluswhat kind oflooking
fellow that Avaswhocutyourtongue out;"andMango-Pare answered,
"There isnoone Icancompare him to,hewasnot likeaman in
theproportion ofhisframe." One ofthem then called out,"Was

cried out,"Have Inotalready toldyou,thatthere isnotoneof

Whakatau himself thenexclaimed, "Was heatalllikemel"And
Mango-Pare, whohadnotbefore seenhim inthecrowd, looked
attentively athim foraminute, andthen cried out,"Isay,
look here allofyou atthis fellow, heisnotunlike theman,he
looks very likehim, perhaps itishehimself." ButWhakatau
coolly asked himagain, "Wastheman really something likeme?"
AndMango-Pare replied, "Yes,hewaslikeyou ;Ireally think it

THEDISSENSIONS WHICH LEDTOTHEMIGRATIONS FROM HAWAIKI.
Our ancestors formerly separated—some ofthem
were left inHawaiki, andsome came here in
canoes. Tuamatua andUenuku paddled intheir
canoes here toAotea ;again, atthattimesome of
them were separated from each other, that istosay,
Uenuku andHoumai-tawhiti.
For inthetime ofHoumai-tawhiti there had
been agreat Avar,andthence there weremany
battles fought inHawaiki ;butthiswarhadcom-
menced long before that time, inthedays ofWha-
katauihu, ofTawhaki, andofTuhuruhuru, when
they carried offKae alive from hisplace asapay-

time ofthedisputes that arose onaccount ofthe
body ofwarriors ofManaia. Again after that
came thetroubles that arose from theactofdese-

hadsloughed from anulcer ofUenuku's. Upon
this occasion, when Toi-te-huatahi andUenuku saw

went everywhere searching for it,andcould not
find it ;theywent from village tovillage, until at
lasttheycame tothevillage ofToi-te-huatahi, and
astheywent theykept calling thisdog.
Atlast thedoghowled inthebelly ofToi',
"Ow!
"ThenTama-te-kapua andWhakaturia called
their dog again, and again ithowled "Ow !"
Then Toi'held hismouth shut asclose aseverhe
could, butthedog stillkept onhowling inhis
inside. Thence Toi' said asfollows, and hiswords
passed intoaproverb, "Oh,hush, hush !Ithought
Ihadhidyouinthebigbelly ofToi',and there
you are,youcursed thing, stillhowling away.''
When Tama-te-kapua and hisbrother hadthus
arrived there, heasked,"Why didnotyou kill

might have felt satisfied, andthatwemight have

were finished, they started thatnight andwent to
the villas^e ofToi'andTJenuku, andarrived atthe
finepoporo treeofUenuku, covered with branches
and leaves, andtheyremained eating thefruit ofit
foragood long time,andthenwenthome again.


THEDISSENSIONS ATHAWAIKl. 125
Thistheycontinued doing every night, until at
lastUenuku and hispeople found that thefruit of
hispoporo treewasnearly allgone, andthey all
wondered what hadbecome ofthe fruit ofthe
poporo tree,andthey looked fortraces, and there
weresome—thetraces ofthe stilts ofTama'. At
night they kept watch onthetree :whilst one
party wascoming tosteal, theotherwas lying in
wait tocatch them ;this latter hadnotwaited
very long,when Tama' and liisbrother came, and
whilst theywerebusy eating, thosewhowere tying
inwait rushed upon them, andcaught both of
them.
They seized Whakaturia atthevery footofthe
tree;Tama' made hisescape, butthey gave chase,
andcaught himonthesea-shore. Assoon asthey
hadhim firmly, thosewhowere holding oncried
out,"Some ofyouchopdown his stilts with
anaxe, sothatthefellowmay fallintothewater;"
and allthosewhohadhold ofhim cried out, "Yes,
yes, lethim fallinto thesea." ThenTama' called
down tothem, "Ifyou fellmeinthewater, I
shall notbehurt, but ifyou cutmedown on

were behind, andwere justrunning up,heard this,
theythought well ofit,sotheychopped himdown

Then allthevillage began toassemble tosee
Whakatm^a puttodeath; andwhen theywere col-
lected, some ofthem said,"Let himbeput to
death atonce;'' and others said,"Oh, don't do
that;youhadmuch better hanghimupintheroof
ofUenuku's house, thathemaybestifled bythe
smoke, and dieinthatway." And thethought
pleased them all,sotheyhunghimupintheroof
ofthehouse, andkindled afire,andcommenced
dancing, andwhen that ceased theybegan singing,
buttheir dancing andsinging wasnotatallgood,
butindeed shockingly bad ;and this they did
every night, until atlastareport oftheir proceed-
ino;s reached theearsofhisbrother Tama' andof
their father.
AndTama heard,"There 'syour brother hang-

isalmost stifled bythesmoke." Sohethought he
would goand seehim,and ascertain whether he
stilllived inspite ofthesmoke. Hewent inthe

dotheydoitwell?'' And theother replied, "No,
nothing canbeworse ;thevery bystanders do
nothing butfind fault with thewayinwhich they
dance andsing/'
Then Tama' said tohim, "Would not itbea

anything sobadasthedancing andsinging ofthose

perhaps they will say, 'There, that will do,now

Then hefinished talking tohim.
ThenWhakaturia called down toUennku, and
toallhispeople, whowere assembled inthehouse,
"Oh, allyoupeople who aredancing andsinging
there, listen tome." Then they allsaid, "Silence,
silence, make nomore noise there, and listen to
what thefellow issaying who ishanging up

smoke, butnosuchthing ;there he is,alive still/'
Sothey allkept quiet.
Then thosewhowere inthehouse called upto

heanswered,"Imean tosaythatyoudon'tknow

Uenuku said,"Lethimdown then;"andhewas
letdown, and thepeople allcalled outtohim,
"Now dance away/' Andhedideverything ex-

Then Whakaturia called out tothem,"Make

Then hesaidquietly tothem, "Iamdying with

Tama-te-kapua stepped uptothedoor ofthehouse,
and satdown there, withtwo sticks inhishand,
allready toboltupthesliding doorandwindow.
Then Whakaturia, asisthecustom inthedance,

attheend ofthehouse near the door, before
hehadsprung back totlieother end,andstand-

from the inside ofthe house, andimmediately
hewasbeyond thedoor. Upsprang Trmia-te-

Whakaturia ;hehelped hisbrother toboltupthe

brother. Astranger whowas presently passing
bythehouse, pulled thebolts outofthedoorand
window forthem, andthecrowd whohadbeen
shut intothehouse came pouring outofit.
Thenextmorning Toi'andUenuku feltvexed
indeed, fortheescape ofthose theyhadtaken as
apayment forthefruit oftheir luxuriant poporo
tree,and said, "Ifwehadhadthesense tokill
them atonce, theywould never have escaped
inthisway. Inthedayswhich arecoming, that
fellow will return, seeking revenge forourhaving

enemy pressing theirway in;'"andHoumai-
tawhiti sliouted inreply, "That 'sright ;letthem
in,letthem in, tillthey reach thevery threshold of
thehouse ofHoumai-tawhiti/' Thrice hismen
called outthis toHou', and thrice didheanswer
them inthesame manner. AtlastuproseHou'
with hissons;then the struggle took place;
those oftheenemy that were not slain were
allowed toescape back outofthetown, butmany
oftheslainwere left there, andtheir bodies were
cutup,baked, anddevoured.
Then, indeed, agreat crime wascommitted by
Hou' and hisfamily, and hiswarriors, ineating
thebodies ofthose men, fortheywere their near
relations, being descended from Tamatea-kai-ariki.
Thence cowardice andfear seized upon thetribe of
Hou': formerly they were allvery brave indeed,
butatlastHou'and allhistribe became cowardly,
and fitfornothing, andHou'andWhakaturia both
died, butTama-te-kapua and hischildren, andsome
ofhisrelations, still lived, andhedetermined to
make peace, thatsome remnant ofhistribe might

CONSTRUCTION OFCANOES TOEMIGRATE TONEWZEALAND.
They then felled atotara tree inRarotonga,
which liesontheother sideofHawaiki, thatthey
midit build theArawa fi'om it.The treewas
felled, andthusthecanoewashewn outfrom itand
finished. Thenames ofthemenwho built this
canoe were, Rata, Wahie-roa, Ngahue, Parata, and
some other skilful men,who helped tohewoutthe
Arawa andtofinish it.
Achief ofthename ofHotu-roa, hearing thatthe
Arawa was built, andwishing toaccompany them,
came toTama-te-kapua andasked himtolendhim
hisworkmen tohewoutsome canoes forhim too,
andtheywent and built and finished theTainui
andsome other canoes.
Theworkmen above mentioned arethosewho
built thecanoes inwhich ourforefathers crossed the
ocean tothis island, toAotea- roa. Thenames of
thecanoes were asfollows :theArawa was first
completed, then Tainui, then Matatua, andTaki-
tumu, and Kura-hau-po, and Toko-maru, and
Matawhaorua. These arethenames ofthecanoes
inwhich our forefathers departed from Hawaiki,

andcrossed tothis island. When theyhadlashed
thetopsides ontotlieTainui, Rata slew thesonof
Manaia, andhidhisbody inthechipsandshavings
ofthecanoes. Thenames oftheaxeswithwhich
theyhewed outthese canoes were Hanhau-te-Rangi,
andTutauru. Tutauru was theaxewith which
they cut offthehead ofUenuku.
Allthese axesweremade from theblock ofgreen
stone brought backbyNgahue toHawaiki, which
was called "The fish ofNgahue.'' Hehad pre-
viously come tothese islands from Hawaiki, when
hewasdriven outfromthence byHine-tu-a-hoanga,

Ngahue came tothese islands;thecanoes which

THEVOYAGE TONEWZEALAND.
When thecanoes were built andready for sea.
they were dragged afloat, theseparate lading of
each canoe was collected andputonboard, with
allthe crews. Tama-te-kapua then remembered
thathehadnoskilful priest onboard hiscanoe,
andhethought thebest thing hecould dowas
tooutwit Ngatoro-i-rangi, the chiefwho had
command oftheTainui. Sojust ashiscanoe
shoved off,hecalled out toNgatoro, "Isay,
Ngatoro, justcome onboardmycanoe, and per-
form thenecessary religious rites forme.'' Then
thepriest Ngatoro came onboard, andTama-te-
kapua saidtohim, "Youhad better also callyour

canoe clean orcommon, with anoffering ofsea-

thenmycanoe willbequite common, for allthe
ceremonies willhave been observed, which should
befollowed with canoes madebypriests. Ngatoro
assented toallthis,and called hiswife,andthey
both gotintoTama's canoe. Theverymoment
theywereonboard, Tama' called outtothemenon
board hiscanoe, "Heave uptheanchors andmake
sail\'andhecarried offwithhimNgatoro and his
wife, thathemight have apriest andwisemanon
board hiscanoe. Then theyupwith the fore-sail,
themain-sail, andthemizen, andaway shot the
canoe.
Upthen came Ngatoro from below, and said,
"Shorten sail,thatwemaygomore slowly, lestI
missmyown canoe." AndTama' replied, "Oh,no,
no;wait alittle, andyour canoe willfollow after
us." Forashort time itkept near them, but
soon dropped more andmore astern, andwhen
darkness overtook them, onthey sailed, eachcanoe
proceeding onitsown course.
Two thefts wereupon this occasion perpetrated
byTama-te-kapua;hecarried offthewife ofRuaeo,
andNgatoro and hiswife,onboard theArawa. He
made afoolofRuaeo too, forhesaid tohim, "Oh,
Eua', you, likeagood fellow, justrunback tothe
village andfetchmemyaxeTutauru, Ipushed itin
under the sillofthewindow ofmyhouse." And

Rua'was foolish enough torunback tothehouse.
Then offwent Tama' with thecanoe, andwhen
Rua'came back again, thecanoe wassofiiroffthat
itssailsdidnotlookmuch bigger than little flies.
Sohefelltoweeping for allhisgoods onboard
thecanoe, and forhiswifeWhakaoti-rangi, whom
Tama-te-kapua hadcarried offasawife forhimself.
Tama-te-kapua committed these two great thefts
when hesailed forthese islands. Hence thispro-
verb,"Adescendant ofTama-te-kapua will steal
anything hecan.''
When evening came on,Rua'threw himself into
thewater, asapreparation forhisincantations to
recover hiswife,andhethenchanged thestars of
evening intothestars ofmorning, andthose ofthe
morning intothestars oftheevening, and thiswas
accomplished. Inthemeantime theArawa scudded
away faroutontheocean, andNgatoro thought to
himself, "What arate thiscanoe goes at—what a
vast spacewehave already traversed. Iknow
what 111do, I'llclimb upupon theroof ofthe
house which isbuilt ontheplatform joining the
twocanoes, andtrytogetaghmpse oftheland in

suspicions about hiswife, lestTama-te-kapua should
steal hertoo,forhehadfound outwhat atreacher-

andhecunningly untied theendofthestring which
Ngatoro hadfastened toherhair,andmade itfast

that itwas still fasttoher.AtlastNgatoro came

Then heknew that hiswdfehadbeen disturbed

Then that priest again went forthupon theroof
oftliehouse andstood there, andhecalled aloud to
theheavens, inthesamewaythatRua' did,andhe
changed thestars oftheevening intothose ofmorn-
ing,andheraised thewinds thattheyshould blow
upon theprow ofthecanoe, anddrive itastern, and
thecrew ofthecanoe were attheir wits' end,and
quite forgot their skill asseamen, andthecanoe
drew straight intothewhirlpool, called "Thethroat
ofTeParata,''* anddashed right intothatwhirlpool.
Thecanoe became engulphed bythewhirlpool,
and itsprow disappeared init.Inamoment the
waters reached the first bailing place inthebows,
inanother second they reached thesecond bailing
place inthecentre, andthecanoenowappeared to
begoing down into thewhirlpool head foremost;
thenupstarted Hei,butbefore hecould risethey
hadalready sunk farintothewhirlpool. Next the
rush ofwaters washeard byIhenga, who slept
forward, andheshouted out, "Oh,Ngatoro, oh,we
aresettling down head first. The pillow ofyour
wife Kearoa hasalready fallen from under her
head !"Ngatoro satastern listening;thesame
cries ofdistress reached himasecond time. Then

out, "Oh,Ngatoro, Ngatoro, aloft there !Doyou
hear ?Thecanoe isgonedown somuch bythe
bow, thatKearoa's pillow hasrolled fromunder her

noranswered until heheard thegoods rolling from
thedecks andsplashing into thewater;thecrew
meanwhile heldontotheca.noe with their hands
with great difficulty, some ofthem having already
ftiUen into thesea.
When these things alltook place, theheart of
Ngatoro wasmoved with pity, forheheard, too,
theshrieks and cries ofthemen, andtheweeping
ofthewomen and children. Thenupstood that
mighty man again, andbyhisincantations changed
theaspect oftheheavens, sothatthestorm ceased,
andherepeated another incantation todraw the
canoe back outofthewhirlpool, that is,tolift
itupagain.
Lo,thecanoe roseupfrom thewhirlpool, float-
ingrightly ;but,although thecanoe itself thus
floated outofthewhirlpool, agreat part ofits
lading hadbeenthrown outintothewater, afew
things onlywere saved, andremained inthecanoe.
Agreat part oftheir provisions were lost asthe

they sailed on,andlanded atWhanga-Paraoa, in
Aotea here. Asthey drew near toland, they
sawwith surprise some pohutukawa trees ofthe
sea-coast, covered with beautiful red flowers, and
the stillwater reflected back theredness ofthe
trees.
Then oneofthechiefs ofthecanoe cried outto
hismessmates,"See there, redornaments forthe
head aremuch more plentiful inthiscountry than
inHawaiki, so111throwmyredhead ornaments
intothewater ;"and, sosaying, hethrew them into
thesea. Thename ofthatmanwasTauninihi;
thename oftheredhead ornament hethrew into
the seawasTaiwhakaea. Themoment they got
onshore they run togather thepohutukawa
flowers, butnosooner didthey touch them than
theflowers felltopieces;thentheyfound outthat
these redheadornaments were nothing butflowers.
Allthechiefs onboard theArawa werethen troubled
that they should have been sofoohsh astothrow
away their redheadornaments intothesea. Very
shortly afterwards theornaments ofTauninihi were
found byMahina onthebeach ofMahiti. Assoon

Assoon astheparty landed atWhanga-Paraoa,
they planted sweet potatoes, thattheymight gi^ow

the cliffs atthat place.
Then thecrew, wearied from thevoyage, wan-
dered idlyalong theshore, and there theyfound
thefresh carcase ofasperm whale stranded upon
thebeach. TheTainui hadalready arrived inthe
same neighbourhood, although they didnotatfirst
seethatcanoe northepeople whohadcome init;
when, however, they met,theybegan todispute as
towhohadlanded firstand firstfound thedead

examine thesacred place which eachparty had set
uptoreturn thanks intothegods fortheir safe
arrival, thattheymight seewhich hadbeen longest
built;and,doing so,theyfound that theposts of
thesacred place putupbytheArawa were quite
green, whilst theposts ofthesacred place setup
bytheTainui had evidently been carefully dried
over the firebefore they hadbeen fixed inthe
ground. Thepeople whohadcome intheTainui

toseparate from those intheTainui, selected some
oftheircrew toexplore thecountry inanorth-west
direction, following thecoast line. Thecanoe then
coasted along, theland party following italong
theshore; thiswasmade upof140men,whose
chiefwas Taikehu, and these gave toaplace the
name ofTeRanga ofTaikehu.
TheTainui leftWhanga-Paraoa *shortly after the
Arawa, and,proceeding nearly inthesame direction

coasted along toRakau-mangamanga, orCape Brett,

called Motukokako, which liesoffthecape;thence
they ranalong thecoast toWhiwhia, and toTe
Aukanapanapa, andtoMuri-whenua, orthecountry

there, theyreturned again along thecoast until they
reached theTamaki, andlanded there, and after-

byTama-te-kapua, andshedidevery tiling exactly
asRua'hadtold her,andTama' began tobeather
(and sheranaway from him). Early inthe
morning Kua' performed incantations, bywhich he
kept allthepeople inthecanoe inaprofound sleep,
andwhilst they still slept from hisenchantments,
thesun rose,andmounted highupintheheavens.
Intheforenoon, Eua' gave thecanoe aheavy
blow with hisclub ;they allstarted up;itwas
almost noon, andwhen theylooked down over the
edge oftheir canoe, there were thehundred and
fortymen ofRua' sitting under them, allbeau-
tifully dressed with feathers, asiftheyhadbeen
living ontheGannet Island, inthechannel of
Karewa, where feathers aresoabundant ;andwhen
thecrew oftheArawa heard this,they allrushed
upon deck,andsawRua' standing inthemidst of
hisonehundred andforty warriors.
Then Rua' shouted out ashestood, "Come
here, Tama-te-kapua ;letustwo fight the battle,
youandIalone. Ifyou arestronger than Iam,
wellandgood, letitbeso;ifIamstronger than
you are,I'11dashyoutotheearth.''
Upsprang then theheroTama-te-kapua;heheld
acarved two-handed sword, asword thehandle of
which wasdecked with redfeathers. Rua' helda
similar weapon. Tama' firststruck afierce blow at
Rua'. Rua' parried it,and itglanced harmlessly

off;thenRua'threw away hissword, and seized
both thearms ofTama-te-kapua ;heheld hisarms
and hissword, anddashed himtotheearth. Tama'
half rose,andwasagain dashed down ;oncemore
healmost rose,andwasthrown again. StillTama'
fiercely struggled toriseandrenew thefight. For
thefourth time healmost rose up,then E-ua',
overcome with rage, took aheap ofvermin (thishe
hadprepared forthepurpose, tocover Tama' with
insult andshame), andrubbed them onTama-te-
kapua's head and ear,andthey adhered sofast
thatTama' tried invain togetthem out.
Then Rua' said, "There, I'vebeaten you ;now
keep thewoman, asapayment fortheinsults I've
heaped upon you,and forhaving been beaten by
me." ButTama' didnothear aword hesaid;
hewasalmost driven mad with thepainand
itching, andcould donothing butstand scratcliing
andrubbing hishead ;whilst Rua' departed with
hishundred and forty men, toseeksome other
dwelling-place forthemselves ;iftheyhadturned
against Tama' andhispeople tofight against them,
theywould have slainthem all.
These men were giants—Tama-te-kapua was
nine feet high, Rua'was eleven feet liigh;there
havebeennomen since thattime sotallasthose

rangi's bones totheir view. Atthetime that the
island Mokoia, inthelakeofRoto-rua, wasstormed
andtaken bytheNga-Puhi, theyprobably carried
those bones off",fortheyhave notsince been seen.
After thedispute between Tama-te-kapua and
Rua' took place, Tama' and hisparty dwelt at
Maketu, and their descendants after alittle time
spread toother places. Ngatoro-i-rangi went, how-
ever, about thecountry, andwhere hefound dry
valleys, stamped ontheearth, andbrought forth
springs ofwater;healso visited themountains,
andplaced Patupaiarehe, orfairies, there, andthen
returned toMaketu anddwelt there.
After this adispute arose between Tama-te-
kapua andKahu-mata-momoe, and inconsequence
ofthat disturbance, Tama' andNgatoro removed
toTauranga, andfounci Taikehu living there, and
collecting food forthem (byfishing), andthat place
was called bythem TeBanga-a-Taikehu ;*itlies

beyond Motu-hoa ;then they departed fromTau-
ranga, andstopped atKati-kati, where they ate
food. Tama's men devoured thefood very fast,
whilst hekeptononly nibbling his,therefore they
applied thiscircumstance asaname fortheplace,
andcalled it"Kati-kati-o-Tama-te-kapua,'' thenib-
bhng ofTama-te-kapua ;thentheyhalted atWhaka-
hau, socalled because theyhereordered food tobe
cooked, which they didnotstop toeat,butwent
right onwith Ngatoro, and thiscircumstance gave
itsname totheplace ;andtheywent onfrom
place toplace tillthey arrived atWhitianga, which
they socalled from their crossing theriver there,
andthey continued going from oneplace toanother
tilltheycame toTangiaro, andNgatoro stuck up
astone and left itthere, andthey dwelt inMoe-
hauandHau-raki.
They occupied those places asapermanent resi-
dence, andTama-te-kapua died, andwasburied
there. When hewasdying, heordered hischildren
toreturn toMaketu, tovisit hisrelations ;andthey
assented, andwent back. Ifthe children of
Tama-te-kapua hadremained atHau-raki, that
placewouldnowhavebeen lefttothem asapos-
session.
Tama-te-kapua, when dying, told hischildren
where theprecious ear-drop Kaukau-matua was,
which hehadhidden under thewindow ofhis

house ;and hischildren returned withNgatoro to
Maketu, anddwelt there;andassoon asNgatoro
arrived, hewent tothewaters tobathe himself, as
hehadcome there inastate oftapu,upon account
ofhishaving buried Tama-te-kapua, andhaving
bathed, hethen became freefrom thetapu and
clean.
Ngatoro then took thedaughter ofIhenga to
wife,andhewent and searched fortheprecious
ear-drop Kaukau-matua, andfound it,asTama-te-
kapua had told them. After this thewife of
Kahu-mata-momoe conceived achild.
Atthistime Ihenga, taking some dogswithhim

AtthistimeNgatoro again went tostamp on
the earth, and tobring forth springs inplaces
where therewasnowater, andcame outonthe
great central plains which surround Lake Taupo,
where apiece oflarge cloakmade ofkiekie-leaves
wasstripped offbythebushes, andthestrips took

press thewhole ofthem todeath).
Ngatoro went straight onandrested atTaupe,
andhebeheld thatthesummit ofMount Tongariro
wascovered with snow, andhewas seized with a
longing toascend it,andheclimbed up,saying
tohiscompanions whoremained below attheir
encampment, "Remember now, donotyou,who I

TheArawa hadbeen laidupbyitscrew at
Maketu, where they landed, andthepeople whohad
arrived with theparty intheArawa spread themselves
over thecountry, examining it,some penetrating to
Koto-rua, some toTaupo, some toWhanganui, some
toRuatahuna, andnoonewas leftatMaketu but
Hei'and hisson,andTiaand hisson,and the

Onthenight that theArawa wasburnt by
Raumati, therewasnotaperson leftatMaketu;
theywere allscattered* inthe forests, atTapu-ika,
and atWaitaha, andNgatoro-i-rangi was atthat
moment athisresidence ontheisland ofMotiti.
Thepa,orfortified village atMaketu, was left
quite empty, without asoul init.Thecanoe was
lying alone, withnone towatch it ;theyhad all
gone tocollect food ofdifferent kinds—ithap-
pened tobeaseason inwhich foodwasvery
abundant, andfrom that cause thepeople were all
scattered insmall parties about thecountry, fishing,
fowling, andcollecting food.
Assoon asthenextmorning dawned, Raumati
could seethat the fortified village ofMaketu was
empty, andnotaperson leftinit,soheand his
armed followers atonce passed over the river
andentered thevillage, which theyfound entirely
deserted.
Atnight, astheArawa burnt, thepeople, who
were scattered about inthevarious parts ofthe
country, sawthe fire, forthebright glare ofthe
gleaming flames was reflected inthesky, lighting

These were thelastwords which Houmai-ta-whiti
addressed tohischildren, andthey everkept these
sayings oftheir father firmly fixed intheir hearts.
"Depart inpeace toexplore newhomes foryour-
selves.""

But, ofcourse, when Eaumati burnt theAi^awa,
thedescendants ofHoumai-ta-whiti could nothelp
continually considering what theyought todo,whe-

destruction oftheir canoe, orwhether they should

Atlasttheymade anendofdeliberation, and
unanimously agreed thattheywould declare war,

arrived intheArawa and thosewho arrived in

(kOMANAIA, KOKUIWAI.)
When theTainui and theArawa sailed away
fromHawaiki with Ngatoro-i-rangi onboard, he
leftbehind him hisyounger sister, Kuiwai, whowas
married toapowerful chiefnamed Manaia. Some
time after thecanoes had left,agreat meeting of
allthepeople ofhistribewasheldbyManaia, to
remove atapu, andwhen thereligious part ofthe
ceremony wasended, thewomen cooked food for
thestrangers.
When their ovens were opened, thefood inthe
oven ofKuiwai, thewife ofManaia, and sister of
Ngatoro-i-rangi, was found tobemuch under-
done, andManaia wasveryangry with hiswife,
andgave herasevere beating, and cursed, saying,
"Accursed beyourhead;arethelogs offirewood

And hispoor wifewas quite overcome with

and laidthem before him, sheeatnothing herself,
butwent ononesideand cried bitterly, andthen
retired andhidherself inthehouse.
And just before night closed inonthem, she

with anewsashmade from theyoung shoots of
thetoetoe, andstood onthethreshold, andspread

andsheandherdaughter, andhersister Haungaroa,
stood before them, andtheappearance ofthegods
wasmost propitious;andwhen herincantations
were ended, shesaid toherdaughter, "My child,

godswere thenbyherbound upincloths, and
shehung them upagain, andreturned into the
house.
Shethen said toherdaughter, "Now depart,

Thewomen thentookbystealth thegods ofthe

theyhadnocanoe fortheir journey, butthese gods

firstcanoes which had leftHawaiki forNew Zea-
land carried nogods forhuman beings withthem;
they only carried thegods ofthesweet potatoes
and offish, they leftbehind them thegods for
mortals, buttheybrought away withthem prayers,
incantations, andaknowledge ofenchantments, for
these things were kept secret intheir minds, being
learnt byheart, onefrom another.
Then thegirlandhercompanions tookwiththem

;
altogether there were fivewomen, andthey jour-
neyed andjourneyed towards New Zealand, and,
borne upbythegods, theytraversed thevastocean
tillatlasttheylanded ontheburning island of
Whakaari, andwhen daylight appeared, they floated
again onthewaters, audfinally landed onthenorth-

and after therest oftheparty haddone eating^
Haungaroa stillwent on,andtwoofhercompa-

along time you continue eating;"and those
plains have ever since been called Kaingoroa, or
Kaingoroa-o-Haungaroa. (thelong meal ofHaun-
garoa). Haungaroa, whowasmuch provoked with
thetwowomen who thus teased her,smote them
onthe face,whereupon they fiedfrom her,and
Haungaroa pursued them alongway, butshepur-
sued invain, theywould notcome back toher, so
byherenchantments shechanged them into Ti

Then theother threewomen continued their

ahill,and satdown there torest themselves,
andwhilst theywere resting, Haungaroa thought
ofhermother, andlove forherovercame her,and
shewept aloud—andthat jAace hasever since been
called TeTangihanga, ortheplace ofweeping.
After theyhad rested forsome time, they con-
tinued their journey, until they reached theopen
summit ofanother high hill,which theynamed
Piopio, andfrom thence theysawthebeautiful lake
ofRoto-rua lying attheir feet,andtheydescended
towards it,andcamedown upon thegeyser, which
spouts upitsjets ofboiling water atthefoot of

wound round italong itssandy shores;thenleaving
thelake behind them, they struck offtowards
Maketu, and atlastreached that place also,coming
outoftheforests upon thesea-coast, close tothe
village ofTuhoro, andwhen theysaw thepeople
there, they called out tothem—"Whereabout is
theresidence ofNgatoro-i-rangi ?"Andthepeople
answered them, "Helives near thelarge elevated

andhaving gotinside, went straight ontothehouse
ofNgatoro-i-rangi, entered it,andgoing rightup
tothespotwhich wassacred, from hissitting onit,
sheseated herself down there.
When Ngatori-i-rangi's people saw this, oneof
them ran offwith allspeed totellhismaster, who
wasthen atwork withsome ofhisservants onhis
farm, andhaving found himhesaid, "There is

When theservant hadended hisstory, Ngatoro
atonce guessed who thisstranger from adistance
must be,and said, "It ismyniece;''andhethen
asked, "Where isTeKehu?" andthey toldhim,
"He isatwork inhisplantation ofsweet pota-

Then shesaid tothem, "Come now,and letus
becleansed bydivmg inrunning water, and let
theceremony ofWhangai-horo beperformed over
us,foryouhave been cursed byManahua and his
tribe."
When theyheard thisthey cried aloud, andtore
offtheir clothes, andrantoarunning stream and
plunged into it,anddashed water over themselves,
andthe priests chanted theproper incantations,
andperformed alltheprescribed ceremonies;and
when these were finished they leftthestream, and
went towards thevillage again, and the priests
chanted incantations forcleansing thecourt-yard of
the fortress from thedefilement ofthecurse of
Manaia;buttheincantations forthispurpose have
notbeenhanded down tothepresent generation.
The priests nextdugalong pit,termed thepit
ofwrath, intowhich bytheir enchantments they
might bring thespirits oftheir enemies, andhang
themanddestroy them there;andwhen theyhad
dugthe pit,muttering thenecessary incantations,

andeach ofthese actstheyaccompanied with pro-

The religious ceremonies being allended, they
satdown, andNgatoro-i-rangi wept over hisniece,
andthen they spread food before the travellers;
andwhen theyhadfinished their meal they all
collected inthehouse ofNgatoro-i-rangi, andthe
oldmenbegan toquestion thestrangers, saying,
"What hasbrought you here?'"Then Kuiw^ai's
daughter said, "Acurse which Manaia uttered
against you;forwhen theyhadfinished making his
sacred place forhim,andthefemales were cooking
food forthestrangers who attended theceremony,

When Ngatoro-i-rangi heard this, hewasvery
wroth, andheinhisturn cursed Manaia, saying,
"Thus shall itbedoneuntoyou—your flesh shall
becooked with stones brought fromMaketu/' Then

which theymight build acanoe, astheyhadno

Then thepeople allarose very early thenext
mornine:, andwiththem were thechosen band of
onehundred and forty warriors, andtheywent
outtosearch foralarge Totara-tree, andKuiwai's
daughter went with them, andshefound agreat
Totara-tree fallen down, andnearly buried inthe
earth ;sotheydug itout,andtheyframed alarge
canoe from it,which theynamed "TheTotara-tree,
dugfrom theearth;"andtheyhauled itdown to
theshore, and,launching it,embarked, andpaddled
outtosea,and thefavourable wind ofPunga-

Ngatoro-i-rangi thenwent atonce toafortified
village named Whaitiri-ka-papa, andwhen he

that shewaswanted outside foraminute\and

heragain, "Where arethey allintheevening?''
andshe replied, "Intheevening they collect in

morning they disperse about/' Then, just as
Ngatoro-i-rangi was going, hesaid toher, "At

house thatyoumayhave agood view, andwatch
what takes place/' Having thus spoken, here-
turned tothemainbody ofhisparty.
Then Ngatoro related tothem allthat hissister
hadtoldhim;andwhen theyhadheard this,Tan-
garoa, oneofliischiefs, said, "Mycounsel is,that
westorm their fortress thisnight;"butthen stood
upRangitu, another chief, and said,"Nay, but
rather letusattack itinthemorning/' Now arose
Ngatoro, andhespake aloud tothem and said,

hereand slain us;soshallwesurprise them/' On
hearing these words from their leader they all
arose, andfollowing him inabody tothecourt-
yard ofthesacred place, theyfound thatthefoolish
priests had feltsosure ofcompeUing their spirits

even prepared ovens tocook their bodies in,and
these were alllyiag open ready forthevictims;
andbythe sides oftheovens they had laid in

were also lying ready tobeheated. Then the
onehundred and fortymenwent and laidthem-

though theyhadbeendead bodies, andtheyturned
themselves about, andbeat themselves upon their

clubs ofjasper andofbasalt, andofthebones of
whales, andthepriestswhom theyhadwiththem
having found outthesacred place ofthepeople
ofthat country, entered it,and hidthemselves
there.
Thus theycontinued tolieintheovens until the
sunarose next morning, and until thepriests of
their enemies, according totheir custom eachday
atdawn, came tospread leaves andother offerings
tothegods inthesacred place, and there, totheir
surprise, these priests found thewarriors ofNgatoro-
i-rangi alllymg heaped upintheovens. Then the
imests raised joyful shouts, crying—"Atlastour
prayers have been answered bythegods ;here,
here arethebodies ofthehost ofNgatoro andof

hasbeen donebyom-god—hecarried them off,
andbrought them here.'' Themultitude ofpeople
inthevillage hearing these cries, ranouttosee
thewonder, andwhen theysawthebodies ofthe
onehundred andforty lying there, with theblood
inclots dried onthem, theybegan tocryout,—one,
"111have thisshoulder ;"another, "And I'11have

Manaia when they entered thesacred place, to
perform the fitting rites tothegods.
Sothese latter cried aloud, asthey ofi'ered
thanksgivings tothegods forhaving granted their
prayers, andforhaving fulfilled theirwishes ;butjust
astheir ceremonies were finished, thepriests ofthe
warparty ofNgatoro-i-rangi rushing (outoftheir
liiding places) upon theother priests, slew them,
sothatthepriests were first slain, asofferings tothe
gods. Then arose theonehundred andfortymen
from theovens, andrushed upon their enemies:all
were slain, notoneescaped butManaia, andhefled
tothetown ;butthey atonce attacked andcarried

prayers, andwhen these ceremonies were ended,
theconquerors cooked thebodies oftheir enemies,
anddevoured thewhole ofthem;butsoon after-
wards thewarriors ofthe otlier towns ofManaia
which hadnotbeen assaulted, were approaching as
aforlorn hope toattack their enemies.
Inthemeanwhile Ngatoro-i-rangi and hiswar-
riors, unaware ofthis,had retired towards their
canoe, whilst thehost ofwarriors whom Manaia
had again assembled were following upon their
traces. They sooncame toastream which theyhad
topass,andfording thatthey left itbehind them,
andgained their canoe, butbythetimetheywere
there, their pursuers hadreached thestream they
hadjust left.
Ngatoro-i-rangi now feltthirsty, andremembered
thattheyhadnowater forthecrew ofthecanoe,
sohesaid, "There isnowater here forus;''and
Rangitu hearing thevoice ofhiscommander, an-
swered cheerfully, "No, there isnone here, but
there isplenty inthestream wehave just crossed.
Sothey gave the gi-eat calabash ofthecanoe to
Rangitu, andhereturned towards thestream, but
before hegotthere thehost ofManaia hadreached

Rangitu, who didnot seethem, assoon ashe

Having thusavenged themselves oftheir enemies,
they again returned tothese islands and settled at
Maketu, and cultivated farms there. Manaia, on
hispart,wasnot idle, forshortly after theyhad
lefthisplace ofresidence, he,with histribe, setto
work atrefitting their canoes.
Ngatoro-i-rangi, inthemeantime, occupied the
island ofMotiti, oifTauranga, intheBay of
Plenty. There hebuilt afortified village, which
henamed Matarehua, and alarge house orna-
mented with carved work, which henamed Tai-
maihi-o-Rongo ;and hemade alarge under-
gi'ound store forhissweet potatoes, which henamed
TeMarihope;andheand hisoldwife generally
lived nearly alone intheir village onMotiti, whilst
thegreatbody oftheir people dwelt onthemain-
land atMaketu;whilst theoldcouple were inthis
way living onMotiti, suddenly oneevening Manaia,
with alarge fleet ofcanoes andawhole host of
warriors, appeared offthecoast ofthe island, and
they pulled straight uptothelanding-place, opposite
tothehouse ofNgatoro-i-rangi, and layontheir
paddles there, whilst Manaia hailed him, calling out,
"Ho !brother-in-law, come outhere ifyou dare,

hecame boldly outofthehouse, although hewas

heassented toit,saying, "You areright, ithas

"Youhadbetter bring-to your canoes inthean-
chorage outside there/' Manaia therefore told his
army toanchor their canoes, andtolosenotime in
cooking their food onboard;and the priest
Ngatoro-i-rangi remained inhisfortress.
Allthe early part ofthenight Ngatoro-i-
rangi remained inthesacred place, performing en-
chantments andrepeating incantations, andhiswife
waswith himmuttering herincantations ;and
having finished them, theyboth returned totheir

that tlieywould destroy Ngatoro-i-rangi, having
now caught hunalmost alone.
Sosoon asthedepth ofnight fellupon the
world, whilst Ngatoro and hisaged wifewere still
inthehouse, and theoldwoman was sitting at
thewindow watching forwhat might take place,
sheheard thehost ofManaia insulting herself and
herhusband, bysinging taunting war-songs. Then
theancient priest Ngatoro, whowas sitting atthe
upper end ofthehouse, rises up,unloosens and
throws offhisgarments, and repeats hisincanta-
tions, and callsupon thewinds, andupon the
storms, andupon thethunder and lightning, that
theymay allariseanddestroy thehost ofManaia;
and thegodTawhiri-matea hearkened unto the
priest, andhepermitted thewinds toissue forth,
together with hurricanes, and gales, andstorms, and
thunders and lightnings;andthe priest and his
wifehearkened anxiously thattheymight hearthe

Then,when itwasthemiddle space between the

andtheroaring ofthewaves, they closed their

alltheloud confusion became hushed, andnothing

When thenextmorning broke, theaged wife of
Ngatoro went outofherhouse, andlooked tosee
what hadbecome ofthehost ofManaia, and as
shecasthereyes along theshore, there shesaw

Ngatoro-i-rangi rave tothisslaughter wasMaiku-

name ofMaikukutea totheslaughter, because the
fishhaving eaten thebodies ofManaia's warriors,
only their bones, and the nails oftheir hands
and feet,buthardly anypart oftheir corpses,
could befound.
Ofthevast host ofManaia that perished, not

when hischosen band ofonehundred and forty

Thuswasavenged thecurse ofMutahanga and

ifthecanoeArawa hadnotbeenburnt byRaumati,
thenNgatoro andhiswarriors would havehadtwo

been utterly destroyed.
Itwould alsohave been farbetter ifNgatoro

have been burnt ;forfrom theburning ofthat

THELEGEND OFHATUPATU ANDHIS
BROTHERS.
When Tama-te-Kapua went with hisfollowers to
Moe-hau, the hillnearCape Colville, and I.henga
and hisfollowers went toRoto-rua, then Ha-nui,
Ha-roa, andHatupatu went also toWhakamaru,
toMaroa, toTuata, toTutuka, toTuaropaki, to
Hauhungaroa, toHurakia, and toHorohoro, the
districts which liebetween Lakes Taupo andRoto-
rua,andbetween Roto-rua and thehead ofthe
Waikato River, tosnare birds forthemselves, and
followed their sport formany aday, until theyhad
hunted forseveral months ;buttheir httle brother
Hatupatu was allthistime thinking tohimself
thattheynever gavehimanyoftherare dainties
ornice things that they got, sothat theymight
allfeast together, but ateach meal hereceived
notliing buttheleantough birds; sowhen the
poor httle fellow went and satdown bytheside
ofthe fire tohis food, heevery dayused to
keep oncrying and eating, crying and eating,
during hismeals. At last, saucy, mischievous

thouglits roseupinhisyoung heart. Sooneday,
whilst hisbrothers were outsnaring birds, and
he,onthis asonevery other day,was leftattheir
resting-place totake care ofthethings, the little
rogue crept into thestorehouse, where thebirds,
preserved intheirown fat,were kept incala-
bashes, andhestole some, and setresolutely to
work toeatthem, with some tender fern-root,
nicely beaten and dressed, forarelish;sothat to
look athimyoucould nothelpthinking ofthe
proverb, "Bravo, that throat ofyours canswallow
anything/'
He finished allthe calabashes ofpreserved
birds, and then attacked those that were kept
incasks, andwhen hehad quite filled himself
hecrept outofthestorehouse again, andthere he
went trampling over thepathway that ledtotheir
resting-place, running about this side, and that
side,and allround it,that hisbrothers might be
induced tothink awar party had come, and
hadeaten upthefood intheir absence. Then he
came back, andranaspear into himself intwo
orthree places, where hecould notdohimself
much harm, andgave himself agood bruise ortwo
upon hishead, and laiddown ontheground near
their hut.
When hisbrothers came back they found him

lying there inappearance very badly wounded;
theynext ran tothestorehouse, andfound their
preserved birds allgone :sotheyasked himwho
haddone allthis,andhereplied, "Awarparty/'
Then theywent tothepathways andsawthefoot-
marks, and said,"It istootrue/' They melted
some fat,andpoured warm oilonhiswounds, and
herevived ;andthey allateastheyused todoin
former days, thebrothers enjoying allthegood
things, whilst Hatupatu kept eating and crying,
andhewentand satonthesmoky sideofthe fire,
sothat hiscruel brothers might laugh athim, saying,
"Oh,never mind him;those arenot real tears,
they areonly hiseyeswatering from thesmoke/'
Next dayHatupatu stopped athome, and off
went hisbrothers tosnare birds, andhebegan to
steal thepreserved birds again, andthus hedid
every day, every day,and ofcourse atlast his
brothers suspected him,andonedaythey laid in
wait forhim,when henotforeseeing this, again
crouched into thestorehouse andbegan eating.
"Ha, ha,ha,weVecaught younow then;your
thievish tricks arefound out, arethey, you little
rogue ?"Hisbrothers killed him atonce, and
buried him inthe large heap offeathers they
had pulled outfrom thesnared birds ;after
thistheywent back toKoto-rua, andwhen they

arrived, their parents asked tliem, "Where is
Hatupatu ?What 'sbecome ofyour little brother?"
And they answered,"Wedon'tknow;wehave
notseenhim/' And their parents said, "You've
killed him." Andthey replied, "We havenot;"
andthey disputed anddisputed together, and at
last their parents said, "Itistootrue thatyou
must have killed him, forhewentaway with you,
andheismissing nowwhen youreturn tous."
Atlength Hatupatu's father andmother thought
theywould send aspirit tosearch forhim ;sothey
sent one,andthespirit went. Itsformwas that

them uptohismouth, andletting them fall slil}^.
Atdawn thewoman prepared togoandspear birds,
butHatupatu always remained athome, andwhen
shehad departed, hebegan tocook food forhim-
self,and tolook atallthethings inthecave of

She onlymade three strides, before shehad

theycame toRoto-rua ;andwhen they arrived at
thesulphur-springs (called TeWhaka-rewa-rew^a),
Hatupatu jumped over these;butKurangaituku
thinking theywere cold, tried towade through, but
sunk through thecrust, andwasburnt todeath.
Hatupatu proceeded onand satontheshore of
the lake, andwhen theevening came, hedived
into thewater, and roseupatthe island of

where hefound Hatupatu lying inthewarm-

him, "Whom areyou fetching thatwater for

Sohewent, andhesaid, "Letmyfather sleepwith

hisbrothers noticed thattherewasachange intheir

At last,they heard thepeople allcalling out,
"Oh, oh,Hatupatu's here;''andone ofthem
said, "Oh, no,that can't be;why, Hatupatu is

fortheoccasion. When thiswas finished hishead
appeared rising upoutofthestorehouse, andhe
repeated another incantation, andafterwards athird
over hissword.
Hatupatu nowcame outofthestorehouse, and
ashisbrothers gazed onhim, they saw his
looks were most noble;glared forth onthem
theeyes oftheyoung man, and glittered forth
themother-of-pearl eyes ofthecarved faceonthe
handle ofhissword, andwhen themany thousands
oftheir tribewhohadgathered round saw the
youth, they toowere quite astonished athisnoble-
ness;theyhadnostrength left,they could do
nothing butadmire him :hewasonly alittleboy
when theyhad seenhim before, andnow,when
theymethimagain, hewas likeanoble chief,and
theynowlooked upon hisbrothers withvery differ-
enteyesfrom those withwhich theylooked athim.
Histhree brothers sprang athim;threewooden
swords were atthesame time levelled atHatupatu
toslayhim ;heheld theblade ofhissword
pointed totheground, tilltheswords ofhisbro-
thers almost touched him,when herapidly warded

again, two felled bytheblade ofhissword, and
onebythehandle;itwasenough—theygave in.
Then their father said tothem, "Oh !mysons, I
would thatyouwere asstrong inpeace asyou
areinattacking oneanother;inseeking revenge
foryour ancestral canoe, TeArawa, wliich was
consumed inafirebythechief Raumati. Long-
haveyoubeen seeking torevenge yourselves upon
him,butyouhave notsucceeded, youhave gained
noadvantage;perhaps you areonly strong and
boldwhen you attack your young brother, my
last-born child/'
When hissons Ha-nui, Ha-roa, andKarika
heard these words oftheir father, theyand their
many followers felttheir hearts grow sad ;they
began toprepare forawar party, bybeating
flatpieces ofprepared fern-root ;andthey cooked
sweet potatoes inovens, andmashed them, and
packed them upinbaskets offlax, and again
putthem inthe ovens, that thefood might
keep foralong time;andthey cooked shell-fish
inbaskets, andthus collected food foranexpe-
dition toMaketu. Whilst his brothers were
making allthese preparations fortheexpedition,
their father was secretly teaching Hatupatu the
tattoo marks andappearance ofRaumati, sothat
hemight easily recognise that chief; andwhen
thecanoes started with thewarriors, hedidnot

canoes hadreached themiddle ofthe lake,when
Hatupatu rose up,andtaking thn^ty cloaks of
redfeathers with him,went offtothewar;he
proceeded bydiving under thewater—thatwas
thepath hechose; andwhen hereached the
deepest part ofthe lake, hestopped toeata
meal ofmussels inthewater, andthen roseup
from thebottom andcame out.Hehadgotas
far asNgaukawakawa, when hisbrothers and
thewarriors inthecanoes arrived there, and
found him spreading out the cloaks hehad
brought withhim todry; and assoon astheir
canoes reached theshore theyasked him,"Where is

tiful red flowers. His brothers' canoes hadby
thistime gotoutinto Roto-iti ;then heagain

thenext daythey reached Maketii ;andwhen
theevening came they ranged their warriors in
divisions ;three hundred and forty warriors were
told offforeach ofthedivisions, under thecom-
mand ofeach ofHatupatu's three brothers; but
nodivision wasplaced under hiscommand.
Hatupatu knew that thejealousy ofhisbro-
thers, onaccount oftheir former quarrels, was
thereason they hadnot told offanymen for
him ;sohesaid, "Oh,ray brothers, Ididnot
refuse tohearken toyou,when youaskedmeto

cloaks hehadwithhim;andwhen hehad finished,
thewarband ofthese figures, which theyoung man
hadmade, looked just likeaband ofrealwarriors.
Thedayhadhardly dawned, when theinhabitants
oftheplace theyhadcome toattack saw their
enemies, and sent ofi"messengers totellthewar-
riors, onthissideand that side, that they should
come and fight with them against thecommon
enemy.
Inthemeantime, allthewarriors ofthecolumns
ofHatupatu's brothers were exhorting their men,
andencouraging them bywarlike speeches;first
onechief stood uptospeak, andthen another, and
when theyhad allended, Hatupatu himself gotup,

oftheplace theyhadcome toattack sawhow
numerous were thechiefs inthecolumn ofHatu-

dreaded hisdivision much more than those ofhis
brothers.
His brothers^ divisions hadmany warriors in

divisions, and also three chiefs ;whilst, although
Hatupatu hadonly one division, itappeared to
becommanded byamultitude ofcliiefs,whohad
superb dresses;thence theenemy burnt with fear
ofthat division, which they accounted tobecom-
posed ofmen ;butno ;itwas onlyformed of
clumps ofgrass dressed up.
Now thepeople oftheplace theywere attacking

Allthistime thedivision ofHatiipatu appears

Then hishand grasps thehead ofRaumati, which

LEGEND OFTHEEMIGRATION OFTURT,
(theprogenitor ofthewhanganui tribes.)
Theibllowing narrative shows thecause which led
Turi, theancestor oftheWhanganui tribes, to
emigrate toNew Zealand, andthemanner inwhich
hereached these islands.
Hoimatua, anear relation ofTuri,hadalittle
boynamed Potikiroroa ;thisyoung fellow Avas
sentonedaywith amessage toUenuku, whowas
anarlJci, orchief high-priest, tolethimknow
that aburnt-offering hadbeenmade tothegods,
ofwhich Uenuku, asariJd, was toeatpart,and
the little fellow accidentally tripped and felldown
intheverydoorway ofWharekura, thehouse of
Uenuku, and thisbeing amost unlucky omen,
Uenuku was dreadfully irritated, and helaid
hold ofthe little fellow, and atehim up,without
evenhaving thebody cooked, and sothepoorboy
perished.
Turiwasdetermined tohave revenge forthis
barbarous act,and toslaysome person asapay-
ment forlittle Potikiroroa, and, after casting about

inhistliouglits forsome time astothemost effec-
tualmode ofdoing this,hesawthat hisbestway
ofrevenging himself would betoseizeHawepotiki,
the little sonofTJenuku, and killhim.
Oneday Turi, inorder toentice theboy to
hishouse, ordered thechildren ofallthepeople
who dwelt there withhim tobegin playing toge-
ther, inaplacewhere Hawepotiki could seethem;
sotheybegan wliipping their tops, andwhirling
their whizgigs, but itwas ofnouse;the little
fellow could notbetempted tocomeandplaywith
them, andthat plan failed.
Atlastsummer came with itsheats, scorching
men's skins; and Turi, onevery hotday, ordered
allthe little chikken torunandbathe intheriver

began sporting andplaying inthewater. When
little Hawepotiki saw alltheother ladsswim-
mingandplaying intheriver, hewasthrown off
liisguard andranthere too,andTuri waylaid, him,
and killed him inamoment, andthusrevenged
thedeath ofPotikiroroa.
After killing the poor boy, Turi cut tlie
heart outofhisbody, which waseaten byhim-
selfandhisfriends; butwhen, shortly afterwards,

unable toascertain what hadbecome ofhim, could
nothelp sighing when hesawsuch anexcellent

Hehad hardly, however, ended hismeal, when

knew this well, because, ashehadkilled thechild
ofUenuku, heguessed thattheymeant toslayhim
asapayment fortheboy,andthat thelament
hiswifehadheard evinced thattheywere secretly
laying their plans ofrevenge.
He,therefore, atonce started offtohisfather-
in-law, Toto, togetacanoe from him, inwhich he
might escape from hisenemies;andToto gave
him one, thename ofwhich wasAotea; thetree
from which ithadbeen made grew upon the
banks oftheLake Waiharakeke. Toto had
firsthewn down the tree, and then split it,
breaking itlengthways intotwo parts; out of
onepart ofthetree hemade acanoe, which
henamed Matahorua, and outoftheother part
hemade acanoe which henamed Aotea. He
gave the canoe which hehadnamed Mata-
horua toKuramarotini ;andthecanoe which he
hadnamed Aotea hemade apresent oftoRongo-
rongo ;thus giving acanoe toeach ofhistwo
dauo'hters. Matahorua wasthecanoe inwhich a

meyour line,and letmesee ifIcannot pull it
upforyou/' ButKupe answered, "It'sofno
use,youcannot do it;youhad better give a
plunge inatonce, and pull itup." Thiswasa
mere stratagem upon thepart ofKupe, thathe
might obtain possession ofKviramarotini, whowas
Hoturapa's wife ;however, Hoturapa notsuspect-
ing tliis, good-naturedly dived down atonce to
bring upKupe's line ;and assoon ashehad
made hisplunge, Kupe atonce cuttherope
which was attached totheanchor, andpaddled
offfortheshore asfasthecould go,tocarry off
Hoturapa's wife, Kuramarotini. When Hoturapa
came uptothesurface ofthewater, thecanoe was
already along distance from him,andhecried out
toKupe, "Oh,Kupe, bring thecanoe back here to
takemein." ButKupe would notlisten tohim,
hebrought notback thecanoe, and soHoturapa
perished. Kupe thenmade haste, and carried off
Kuramarotini, and toescape from thevengeance of
therelations ofHoturapa, hefledaway with her,
ontheocean, inhercanoe Matahorua, and dis-
covered theislands ofNew Zealand, and coasted
entirely round them, without finding any inhabi-
tants.
AsKupe wasproceeding down theeastcoast of


208 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
New Zealand, andhad reached Castle Point, a
great cuttle-fish, alarmed atthesight ofacanoe
withmen in it,fledaway from alarge cavern
which exists inthesouth headland ofthecove
there ;itfledbefore Kupe, inthedirection ofKau-
kawa, orCook's Straits ;when Kupe arrived at
those straits, hecrossed them inhiscanoe, to
examine themiddle islands ;seeing theentrance of
Awa-iti, (now called Tory Channel,) running deep
upinto the land, heturned hiscanoe inthere
toexplore it ;hefound avery strong current
coming outfrom between thelands, andnamed
theentrance Kura-te-au ;strong asthecurrent
was,Kupe stemmed itinhiscanoe, andascended
it,until hewas just surmounting thecrown
oftherapid. The great cuttle-fish ordragon,
thathad fledfrom Castle Point, which Kupe
named TeWheke-a-Muturangi, orthe cuttle-fish
ofMuturangi, had fled toTory Channel, and
waslying hidinthis part ofthecurrent. The
monster heard thecanoe ofKupe approaching as
theywere pulling upthecurrent, and raised its
arms above thewaters tocatch anddevour the
canoe, menand all.As itthus floated upon the
water, Kupe saw it,andpondered howhemight
destroy theterrible monster. Atlasthethought of
aplan fordoing this; hehadalready found that,
although hekeptonchopping off"portions ofits

gigantic arms, furnished with suckers, asittried
tofoldthem about thecanoe, inorder topull it
down, themonster was toofierce tocare forthis;
soKupe seized animmense hollow calabash he
hadonboard tocarry hiswater in,andthrew it
overboard ;hardly had ittouched thewater ere
themonster flew at it,thinking that itwas the
canoe ofKupe, andthathewould destroy it ;so
itreared itswhole body outofthewater, topress
down thehuge calabash under it,andKupe, ashe
stood inhiscanoe, being inamost excellent posi-
tion tocut itwith hisaxe, seized theoppor-
tunity, and, striking itatremendous blow, he
severed itintwo,andkilled it.*
The labours ofKupe consisted inthis, thathe
discovered these islands, andexamined thedifferent
openings which hefound running upintothecoun-
try.Heonlyfound twoinhabitants inthecoun-
try,abirdwhich henamed theKokako, andan-
other birdwhich henamed theTiwaiwaka ;he,
however, didnotultimately remain inthese islands,
butreturned tohisown house, leaving theopen-
ingshehadexamined inthecountry assigns that
hehadbeen here.

touched with hiscanoes ;but Ihave notyethadtime toarrange

Thus helefthismarks here, buthehimself re-
turned tohisown country, where hefound Turi
and allhispeople stilldwelling;although itwas
now thefourth year from that one inwhich he
had slain littleHawepotiki ;butTuriwasthen on
thepoint offlying toescape from thevengeance of
Uenuku, and asheheard ofthediscoveries Kupe
hadmade, hedetermined tocome tothese islands.
Sohehad hiscanoe, theAotea, dragged down to
theshore inthenight, andKupe, whohappened to
benear theplace,andheard thebottom ofthecanoe
grating upon thebeach asthey hauled italong,
went toseewhatwasgoing on ;andwhen he
found what Turiwasabout todo,hesaid to
him, "Now, mind, Turi, keep ever steering tothe
ea;stward, where thesun rises ;keep thebow of
your canoe ever steadily directed towards that
point ofthesky.'' Turianswered him, "Youhad
better accompany me,Kupe. Come, letusgoto-
gether." Andwhen Kupe heard this, hesaid to
Turi,"Doyouthink thatKupe willever return
there again T'andhethen continued, "When you

Turi's brother-in-law, Tuau,now called outto
him, "Why, Turi, thepaddles youaretaking with
youaregood fornothing, forthey aremade from the
huhoe-tree;'"Turi replied, "Wherever can Iget
other paddles now?'' andTuau answered, "Just
wait alittle, until Irunforthepaddles ofTaipa-
rae-roa;" andhebrought back, andputonboard
thecanoe, two paddles, thenames ofwhich were
Rangihorona and Kautu-ki-te-rangi, and two
bailers, thenames ofwhich were Tipuahoronuku
and Kangi-ka-wheriko. Then Turi said, "Tuau,
come outalittleway toseawith me,and
then return again, when youhave seenmefairly
started uponmylong voyage." TothisTuau
cheerfully consented, and got into the canoe,
which wasalready afloat ;thenwere carried on
board allthe articles which thevoyagers were to
take ;and their friends putonboard forthem

seed, sweet potatoes, ofthespecies called TeKakau,
anddried stones oftlieberries oftheKaraka-tree;
andsome live edible rats inboxes, andsometame
green parrots ;andadded some petPukekos, or
large water-hens ;andmany other valuable things
were putonboard thecanoe, Avhence theproverb,
"TheAotea's valuable freight."
Atlastaway floated thecanoe, whilst itwas
yetnight, andTuau satatthe stern, gently pad-
dling astheydropped outfrom theharbour ;but
when theygottoitsmouth, Turi called outtohis
brother-in-law, "Tuau, youcome and sitfora
little atthehouse amidships, onthe floor ofthe
double canoe, and letmetake thepaddle and pull
tillIwarm myself.'' SoTuau came amidships,
and satdown with thepeople there, whilst Turi
went astern andtook hispaddle. Then Turiand
hispeople pulled ashard asthey could, andwere
soon faroutside theharbour, inthewide sea.
Tuau,whohadintended toland attheheads, atlast
turned toseewhat distance theyhad got. Alas !
alas !theywere farout atsea ;then hecalled
outtoTuri, "Oh,Turi, Turi, pray turnback the
canoe andland me.'' Butnotthe least attention
didTuripaytohim ;hepersisted incarrying off
hisbrother-in-law with him, although there was
Tuau weeping andgrieving when hethought ofhis

children and wife,nndlamenting aslieexclaimed,
"How shall Iever gethack tomydear wifeand
children from theplacewhere youaregoing toI"
Butwhat does Turi care forthat ;hestillthinks
fittocarryhim offwith him,andTuau cannot now
help himself. Theywerenow sofaroutatseathat
hecould notgain the shore, forhecould scarcely
have seenwhere thelandwaswhilst swimming in
thewater, asitwasduring thenight-time that
they started.
Lo !thedawn breaks;buthardly hadtheday-
light ofthe firstmorning oftheirvoyage appeared,
than oneoftheparty, named Tapo, became insolent
anddisobedient toTuri. His chiefwas therefore
verywroth with him,andhovehimoverboard into
thesea ;andwhenTapo found himself inthewater,
andsawthecanoe shooting ahead, hecalled outto
Turi quite cheerfully andjocosely, "Isay,oldfellow,
come now, letmeliveintheworld alittle longer;"
andwhen theyheard him calloutinthismanner,
theyknew hemust beunder theprotection ofthe
godMaru, and said, "Here isMaru, here isMaru.''
Sotheyhauled himintothecanoe again, andsaved
his life.
Atlasttheseams ofTuri's canoe opened inholes
inmany places, and thewater streamed into it,
andthey rapidly dipped thebailers into thewater
anddashed itoutover thesides;Turi, inthe


214 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY
meanwliile, reciting aloud anincantation, which
was efficacious inpreventing acanoe from being
swamped ;they succeeded atlength, bythese
means, inreaching asmall island which liesin
mid-ocean, which theynamed Rangitahua ;there
they landed, andripped alltheoldlashings outof
theseams ofthecanoe, and re-lashed thetopsides
ontoit,andthoroughly refitted it.
Amongst thechiefswholanded there withthem
wasonenamed Porua, whose canoe was called Te
Ririno. They were carrying some dogswith them,
asthesewould bevery valuable intheislands they
were going to,forsupplying bytheir increase a
good article offood, and skins forwarm cloaks;
onthis island, they, however, killed two ofthem,
thenames ofwhich wereWhakapapa-tuakura and
Tanga-kakariki ;the first ofthese theycooked and
shared amongst them, butthesecond they cutup
rawasanoffering forthegods,andlaid itcutopen
inevery part before them, andbuilt asacred place,
and setuppillars forthe spirits, thattheymight
entirely consume the sacrifice;andtheytook the
enchanted apron ofthe spirits, andspread itopen
before them, andwearied the spirits bycalling
onthem forsome omen, saying, "Come, mani-
festyourselves tous,Ogods ;make haste and
declare thefuture tous. Itmaybenow, thatwe
shall notsucceed inpassing totheother sideofthe


THEEMIGEATION OFTURI. 215
ocean;but ifyoumanifest yourselves tous,and
arepresent with us,weshall pass there insafety/'
Then they roseupfrom prayer, androasted with
firethedogwhich theywere ofl^ering asasacri-
fice,andholding thesacrifice aloft, called over the
names ofthe spirits towhom the oflfering was
made;andhaving thusappeased thewrath ofthe
ofiended spirits, theyagain stuck upposts forthem,
saying asthey didso—
"'Tisthepostwhich stands above there ;^
'Tisthepostwliich stands intlieheavens,
Near Atutahimarehua."
Thus theyremoved allill-luck from thecanoes,
byrepeating overthem prayers called Keuenga,
Takanga, Whakainuinumanga, &c.&c.
When allthese ceremonies were ended, avery
angry discussion arose between Potoru andTuri, as
tothedirection they should now sailin;Turi per-
sisted inwishing topursue aneasterly course,
saying, "Nay, nay, letus still sailtowards the
quarter where thesun first flares up;''butPotoru
answered him, "But Isaynay, nay, letusproceed
towards thatquarter oftheheavens inwhich the
sun sets/' Turi replied, "Why, didnotKupe,
whohadvisited these islands, particularly tellus?
Now mind, letnothing induce you toturn the
prow ofthecanoeaway from that quarter ofthe


216 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
heavens inwhich thesun rises/' However, Potoru
stillpersisted inhisopinion, and atlastTurigave
upthepoint, and lethimhave hisownway ;so
theyembarked and lefttheisland ofRangitahua,
and sailed onawesterly course.
After theyhadpursued this course forsome
time, thecanoe Ririno getting into the surf, near
some rocks, was lostonareefwhich theynamed
Taputapuatea, being swept awaybyastrong cur-
rent, arapid current, byaswift running current,
swiftly running ontotherealms ofdeath ;andthe
Ririno wasdashed topieces :hence tothepresent
day ispreserved thisproverb, "You areasobsti-
nate asPotoru, who persisted inrushing ontohis
own destruction.''
When theRirino hadthusbeen lost, Turi, inthe
Aotea, pursued hiscourse towards thequarter ofthe
rising sun,andwhilst theywere yetinmid-ocean,
achild,whom henamed Tutawa, wasborn to
Turi ;theyhadthenbutnine sweet potatoes left,
andTuritookoneofthese, leaving nowbut eight,
andheoffered theonehetook asasacrifice tothe
spirits, andtouched with itthepalate oflittle
Tutawa, born inmid-ocean, atthesame time re-
peating thefitting prayers. When theydrew near
theshore ofthese islands, oneofthecrew, named
Tuanui-a-te-ra, wasvery disobedient and insolent
toTuri, who, getting exceedingly provoked with


THEEMIGRATION OFTURI. 217
him,threw himoverboard into the sea.When
theyhadgotnearenough totheshore toseedis-
tinctly, they foolishly threw theredornaments
theywore ontheir heads, (named Pohutukawa,)
into the sea, these being old, dirty, and faded,
from length ofwear, forthey thought, although
wrongly, theredthings theysaw insuch abun-
dance ontheshore were similar ornaments.
Atlength theAotea isrunuponthebeach of
these islands, andthewearied voyagers spring out
ofherontothesands, andthe firstthing they re-
mark arethefootprints ofaman ;they run to
examine them, andfindthem tobethose ofTua-
nui-a-te-ra, whom Turihad shortly before thrown
overboard ;there canbenodoubt ofthis, because
some ofthefootprints arecrooked, exactly suiting
adeformed footwhich hehad.
Turihaving rested after hisvoyage, determined
tostartandseek fortheriver Patea, which Kupe
haddescribed tohim,andhelefthiscanoe Aotea
intheharbour, which henamed after it.Hetra-
velled along the coast-line from Aotea toPatea,

other party after Pnngarehu, gave names toall
theplaces astheycame along ;when hereached

Atlength hiscanoe reached theshore, and the
crewjumping out, hauled ituponthesandy

towards hisvillage;when hehadgotnearhome,
hiswife seeing himapproach, arose andmade the

who shethought would come back hungry;and
when hereached home the firewas lighted, and
shewas sitting bythe side ofitroasting the

shewent, andwhen shegot there, shefound that

her,andwhen shegotthere, Manaia said,"That is

Manaia then turned over inhismind various
plans forrevenging himself upon thepeople who

and lieconsulted with liisown tribehowtheymight

thetribe ofManaia heard what hadtaken place,
they allarose toseek revenge ;but before the
fighting which arose from this affair broke out,
Manaia went tothepeople whohadwronged his
wife,andtoldthem, "That hehoped theywould

their weapons might betooheavy readily to

Allthese preparations having been made, Ma-

when theopportunity ofrushing ontheir enemies
presented itself, Manaia nudged with hiselbow his
son, Tu-ure-nui, whowas lying byhis side, to
encourage him todistinguish himself byrushing
in,and killing the firstman oftheenemy;but
being afraid togohedidnotmove, andwhilst
Manaia was encouraging him invain, another
young man, thename ofwhose father hadnever
been toldbyhismother, rushed forward andslew
the first oftheenemy, and aswith hisweapon he
struck himdown, hecried out, "The first slain of

The people lying inambush, allfollowed the
youthwhen herushed ontheir enemies, andslaugh-

him closely, butwasnot fleetenough offoot to

andshedid so,repeating anincantation termed
Tapuwae, andwhen shehad finished that,byher

and feeble, sothatManaia rapidly gained onhim,
caught him,andslewhim.
Thus perished Tapenu andtheparty ofpeople
whom hehadtaken withhimtowork forManaia;

throughout thecountry, and atlastreached the
tribe ofTupenu;andwhen theyheard it,they said,
"Your relatives have perished.'' Their army col-

and his tribe, and todestroy them ;they slew
many ofthem, andcontinued from time totime to

attack them, sothat theirnumbers dwindled away,
till atlength Manaia began toreflect within
himself, saying, "Ah, ah,mywarriors arewasting
away, andbyand bye, perhaps, Ialso shall be
slain;rather than letthis state ofthings continue,
Ihadbetter abandon thiscountry, and,removing
toagreat distance, seek anew one formyself

Having made uphismind toactinthisway, he
began torepair acanoe andtofititforsea;the

replied, "No, Iwillnotgowith you;'' Manaia
answered, "That isright, doyouremain here."

dragged itdown tothewater, andhauled itinto

"Letmybrother-in-law nowbeslain asanoffering

Sohecalled tohisbrother-in-law, whowas
standing onthe shore, bidding him farewell;
"Isay,wade outtomeforoneminute, that I

When Manaia's bix)ther-in-law heard this,hebe-

Manaia answered him, "Wade away, there isno
depth ofwater ;"andtodeceive him better, hekept
onpretending totouch thebottom with astick;
andthepoor fellow having nosuspicion, believed
what Manaia said, that thewater wasnotdeep;
butManaia hadspoken before tohispeople, say-
ing, "Lethimcome on,outinto thedeep water,
until hisfeetcannot touch thebottom, then seize
himbythehead and slayhim/' Atlength his
feetcould nolonger touch thebottom, andhe
found himself swimming close tothecanoe;then
Manaia seized himbytliehead, with oneblow of

lawperished.
Having thus slain hisvictim, hecaught uphisdog
which hadswam outwith itsmaster, and lifting it
intothecanoe, hesailed away, tosearch foranew
country forhimself.
Hesailed onand on,andhadproceeded very
farfrom theland theyhadquitted, when oneday
thedogManaia hadtaken into thecanoe scented
land, andhowled loudly, struggling togetloose
andjump overboard into thewater ;thepeople
inthecanoe weremuch surprised atthis,and
said,*'Why, what canbethematter with the
dog?'' Andsome ofthem said,"We'd better let

tinctly hear ;atlasthehad gotsofaroffthey

swimming foralong time, finally reached land.
Inthemeantime thecanoe came following
straight onthetrack which thedoghadtaken,
andwhen atlength thenight ended, andtheday
began tobreak, they again heard thehowling

ofthedog,which hadlanded close tothestranded
carcass ofawhale ;they pulled eagerly tothe
shore, and assoon astheyreached it,there they
saw thewhale lying stranded, andthedogby
itsside;and there theylanded onthis island,—
onAotea.
They were rejoiced, indeed, when they ascer-
tained thiswas thecountry forwhich theyhad
been seeking ;first, they allotted out equally
amongst them thewhale they hadfound ;but
firstManaia addressed hismen, saying, "Wemust
now build ahouse toshelter us,andthenwewill
cutupthewhale." His people atonceobeyed
their chief's directions ;some ofthem began to
collect materials forbuilding ashelter, and others
toclear spots ofground, and toprepare them for
planting.
Some few ofthem called out, "Here isthe
best place forour village
;"whilst others, onthe
contrary, cried out, "No,no,this isthebest place
for it;''and others still,who had gotalittle
farther along thebeach, cried out, "Here isstilla
better place;" and others, yet further ahead,
said, "Here, here, tliis isthebest placewehave

bylittle tlieyhadbeendrawn alongwayfrom the
spotwhere theyhad landed, andfrom thewhale
which theyhadfound.
Now there weresome other canoes coming close
after thecanoe Tokomaru, which presently made the
land too,andreached theshore just atthepoint
where theTokomaru hadbeendrawn upupon the
beach, andtheysawthemarks oftheTokomaru
upon thesand, and thesheds thathadbeen put
up,andthebits ofland thathadbeen cleared;
andthey, without delay, began toclaim each one
ashisown, the sheds, thecleared ground, and
thewhale, which allbelonged tothepeople ofthe
canoe which had firstlanded.
Then theywent tosearch forthepeople whohad
come inthat canoe, andwhen they hadfound
them, eachparty saluted theother, andwhen their
mutual greetings were over, thosewhohadcome
inthe firstcanoe asked thosewhohadcome in
thesecond, "When didyouarrive here?'' And
they answered them bysaying, "When didyou
arrive hereVThose ofthe firstcanoe answered,
"A long time ago.'' Then thepeople ofthe
second canoe answered, "Andwealso arrived a
longtime ago." Thosewhohadcome inthe first
canoenow replied, "Nay, nay,wearrived here be-
foreyou." Then those ofthesecond canoe answered,
"Nay, nay,butwearrived here before you;"and

theycontinued thus disputing, arguing each party
with theother.
AtlastManaia asked them,"What arethe
proofs yougive toshowwhen youarrived here?"
And they answered, "That isallvery well ;but
what proofs haveyou toshowwhen you arrived
hereVButManaia replied, "Theproof Ihave to
showwhen Iarrived here isawhale ofminewhich
Ifound upon thebeach/' Then thepeople who
hadcome inthesecond canoe answered, "No,
indeed, thatwhale belongs tous/' ButManaia
answered quite angrily, "No;Isaythatwhale
belongs tome;just look you,you will findmy
sheds standing there, andmytemporary encamp-
ment, andthepieces oflandwhichmypeople have

indeed those areoursheds, andourpieces ofcleared
land ;andasforthewhale, itisourwhale ;now
letusgoandexamine them/'
Sothewhole party returned together, until
they came totheplace where theyhad landed,
andwhen theysaw allthese things there, Manaia
said, "Look you,thatwhale belongs tome;aswell
asthose sheds andthe cleared pieces ofland/'
But theothers laughed athimand said,"Why
youmust havegonemad, allthese houses belong to
us,andtheclearings, andthatwhale too/' And
Manaia, whowasnow quite provoked, replied, "I

sayno ;theclearings aremine, thesheds aremine, as
well asthewhale/' Theothers, however, answered
him, "Very well, then, ifthat isthecase,where is
your sacred place?"ButManaia replied, "Where is
your sacred place alsothen ?"Andthey answered,
"Come along, andseeit/'And they allwent to-
gether toseethesacred place ofthese newly-arrived
people, andwhen theysaw it,Manaia believed them.
Although hegave credit tothe fact oftheir
having arrived first,Manaia was sorely perplexed
andtroubled, andheabandoned altogether thepart
ofthecountry hehad first reached, and started
again toseek foranother forhimself, forhisrela-
tions, and hispeople ;they coasted right along
theshores oftheisland from Whangaparoa, and
doubled theNorth Cape, andfrom thence made a
direct course toTaranaki, andmade theland at
Tongaporutu, between Pariwinihi andMokau, and
they landed there, andremained forsome time,
and leftthegodtheyworshipped there ;thename
oftheirgodwasRakeiora.
They then turned tojourney back towards
Mokau :some ofthem went byland along the
coast line, and others intheir canoe, thetwo
parties keeping insight ofoneanother asthey exa-
mined thecoast ;andwhen they reached theriver

there, explored the country unto Pukearuhe,
thence they went onasfarasPapatiki, and
there descended totheshore tothebeach of
Kukuriki, and travelling along it,they reached
theriver ofOnaero, forded it,andpassed the
plain ofMotunui, andKaweka, andUrenui;
that river had aname before Manaia and his
people reached it;butwhen Manaia arrived
there with his son, Tu-ure-nui, hechanged its
name, and called itafter his son, Tu-ure-nui;
andthey forded the river, and travelled onuntil
they reached Kohutu, atthemouth oftheriver
Waitara, andthey dwelt there, and there they
found people living, thenative inhabitants ofthese
islands;butManaia and hisparty slewthem, and
destroyed them, sothat thecountry was left for
himself and forhisdescendants, and forhistribe
andtheir descendants, andManaia andhisfollowers
destroyed theoriginal occupants ofthecountry, in
order toobtain possession ofit.

(themaiden ofeotorua).
And theman said tohim,"Now, governor,
justlookround you,and listen tome, forthere is
something worth seeing here;thatvery spot that
youaresitting upon, istheplace onwhich satour
great ancestress Hine-Moa, when sheswam over
herefrom themain. But I'll tellyou thewhole
story.
"Look younow, Rangi-Uru was thename of
themother ofachief called Tutanekai ;shewas,
properly, thewife ofWhakaue-Kaipapa (thegreat
ancestor oftheNgatiwhakaue tribe): but sheat
onetimeranaway with achiefnamed Tuwharetoa
(the great ancestor oftheTeHeukeu and the
Ngatituwharetoa tribe);before thisshehadthree
sonsbyWhakaue, theirnames wereTawakeheimoa,
JSTgararanui, andTuteaiti. Itwas after thebirth
ofthis third son, that Rangi-TJru eloped with
Tuwharetoa, whohadcome toRotorua asastranger
onavisit. From this affair sprang Tutanekai,
whowasanillegitimate child;but finally, Wha-
kaueandRangi-Uru were united again, and she

had another sonwhose name wasKopako;and
then shehadadaughter whom theynamed Tupa;
shewasthelastchild ofWhakaue.
"They allresided hereontheisland ofMokoia.
Whakaue was very kind indeed toTutanekai,
treating him asifhewas hisown son;sothey
grew uphere, Tutanekai and hiselder brothers,
until they attained tomanhood.
"Now there reached them hereagreat report of
Hine-Moa, that shewasamaiden ofrare beauty,
aswell asofhigh rank, forUmukaria (the great
ancestor oftheNgati Unui-karia-hapu, orsub-
tribe), was her father ;hermother's name was
Hine-Maru. When suchfame attended herbeauty
andrank, Tutanekai andeach ofhiselder bro-
thers desired tohave herasawife.
"About thistime Tutanekai built anelevated
balcony, ontheslope ofthat hilljustabove you
there, which iscalled Kaiweka. Hehadcontracted
agreat friendship forayoung mannamed Tiki;
theywerebothfond ofmusic—Tutanekai played on
thehorn, andTikionthepipe ;andthey used to
goupinto thebalcony andplayontheir instru-
ments inthenight ;and incalm evenings the
sound oftheir music waswafted bythegentle
land-breeze across thelake tothevillage atOwhata,
where dwelt thebeautiful young Hine-Moa, the
younger sister ofWaliiao.


THEMAIDEN OFEOTORUA. 237
"Hine-Moa could then hear thesweet-sounding
music oftheinstruments ofTutanekai andofhis
dear friend Tiki,which gladdened herheart within
her—every night thetwo friends played ontheir
instruments inthismanner—andHine-Moa then
ever said toherself,'Ah !that isthemusic of
Tutanekai which Ihear/
"Foralthough Hine-Moa was soprized byher
family, that theywould notbetroth hertoany
chief; nevertheless, sheandTutanekai hadmet
each other onthose occasions when allthepeople
ofRotorua come together.
"Inthose great assemblies ofthepeople Hine-
MoahadseenTutanekai, andasthey often glanced
each attheother, totheheart ofeach ofthem the
other appeared pleasing, andworthy oflove, so
that inthebreast ofeach there grewupasecret
passion forthe other. Nevertheless, Tutanekai
could not tellwhether hemight venture toapproach
Hine-Moa totakeherhand, toseewould shepress
hisinreturn, because, said he,'Perhaps Imaybe

Hine-Moa's heart said toher,'Ifyousend oneof
your female friends totellhim ofyour love, per-

"However, after theyhadthusmet formany,
many days,andhadlongfondly glanced each atthe

messenger, she said,'Eh-hu !havewethen each
loved alikeV
"Some time after this,andwhen theyhadoften
met,Tutanekai andhisfamil}^ returned totheirown
village;andbeing together oneevening, inthelarge
warm house ofgeneral assembly, theelder brothers of
Tutanekai said,'Which ofushasbysigns, orby
pressure ofthehand, received proofs ofthelove of
Hine-Moa?' And one said, 'It isI-who have;'
and another said,'No;but itis1/Then
they alsoquestioned Tutanekai, andhesaid, 'I
have pressed thehand ofHine-Moa, and she
pressed mine inreturn;' but hiselder brothers
said,'Nosuch thing; doyouthink shewould take
anynotice ofsuch alow-born fellow asyouare?'
Hethen told hisreputed father, Whakaue, to
remember what hewould thensaytohim, because
hereally hadreceived proofs ofHine-Moa's love;
theyhadeven actually arranged agood while be-
forethetime atwhich Hine-Moa should runaway
tohim;andwhen themaiden asked,'What shall
bethesignbywhich Ishallknow that Ishould
thenruntoyou?' hesaid toher,'Atrumpet will
beheard sounding every night, itwillbeIwho
sound it,beloved—paddle thenyour canoe tothat
place.' SoWhakaue kept inhismind this con-
fession which Tutanekai hadmade tohim.

"Now always about tliemiddle ofthenight
Tutanekai, and hisfriend Tiki,went upinto their
balcony andplayed, theoneupon histrumpet, the

been careful with thecanoes, toleave none afloat,
buthadhauled them allupupon theshore ofthe

this towarm herself, forshewastrembling all

also, perhaps, from modesty, atthethoughts of

uphisresidence inavillage called Whakatiwai.
Hehad atKawhia, asoncalled Maru-tuahu, but
Hotunui wasnottherewhen this childwas born.
Thecause which made himcome fromKawhia
toHauraki was afalse accusation thatwas
brought against him regarding astore-house of
sweet potatoes belonging toanother chief, afriend
ofhis. The accusation arose inthisway. Ho-
tunui went outofhishouse one night, almost at
thesamemoment thatathiefhadgone outtorob
thisstorehouse ;itwasvery unfortunate thatthey
should both have gone outnearly atthesame
moment, justabout midnight. When daydawned,
Hotunui came outofhishouse, andpeople inthe
morning had seen hisfootsteps, right along the

thesweet potatoes dropped allalong thepath, and
asthe soles ofHotiinui's feetwere very large, his
footprints had quite erased those ofthethief; so
presently theybrought anaccusation against Ho-
tunui, thathehad stolen thesweet potatoes. At
thistimeHotunui's wifehadjustconceived Maiii-

said, "What, thereVandhewasanswered byhis
mother, ".Yes, that isit—Hauraki;" andMaru-
tuahu answered, "'Tiswell ;Iunderstand."
Then Maru-tuahu started with his slave, and
travelled towards Hauraki, andthey carried with
them aspear forkilling birds ;thisthey took
asameans ofprocuring food onthejourney,
astheycame byway ofthewooded mountains
where birds are plentiful ;they were awhole
month before they arrived atKohukohunui, and
reached theoutskirts oftheforests there early one
morning, atthesame time thattwoyoung girls,
thedaughters ofTeWhatu, thechief ofHauraki,
were coming along thesame path from theop-
posite direction. Maru-tuahu wasupinaforest
tree, spearing Tui birds, atthemoment when the
two girlssawtheslave sitting under thetree in
which Maru-tuahu waskilling birds, andhismaster's
cloak lying ontheground byhim. Thetwo
girlscame merrily along thepath ;theyoungest
sister was very beautiful, but the eldest was
plain ;andwhen theysaw theslave ofMaru-
tuahu, theyoungest one,whohad seenhim first,
called out playfully, "Ah !there 'saman will
make anice slave forme.'' "Where?" said the
eldest sister, "where ishe?" and theyoungest

replied, "There, there, cannot you seehim sitting
attherootofthat treeVThenuptheyranto-
wards him, sportively contesting with oneanother
whose slave heshould be ;and theyoungest
gotthere first,and therefore claimed him asher
slave.
Allthistime Maru-tuahu waspeeping down at
thetwo girlsfrom thetopofthetree;andthey
asked the slave, saying, "Where isyour master?''
heanswered, "Ihavenomaster buthim." Then
the girls looked about, and there was thecloak
lying ontheground, andaheap ofdead birds;
andtheykeptonasking, "Where ishe?" but it
wasnotlong before aflock ofTuis settled onthe
treewhere Maru-tuahu was sitting ;hespeared at
them, and struck aTui, wliich made the tree
ringwith itscries;the girls heard it,and look-
ingup,theyoungest saw theyoung chief sitting
inthetopboughs ofthetree;and sheatonce
called uptohim, "Ah !youshall bemyhusband ;"
but the eldest sister exclaimed, "You shall be
mine," andtheybegan jesting anddisputing be-
tween themselves which should have him for
ahusband, forhewasaveryhandsome young
man.
Then thetwo girls called uptohim tocome
down from the tree, anddown hecame, and
dropped upon theground, and pressed hisnose

against thenose ofeach oftheyoung gh'ls. They
thenasked him tocome totheir village withthem;
towhich heconsented, but said, "Youtwogoon
ahead, and leavemeandmy slave, andwewill
follow you presently;'' andthegirls said, "Yery
Avell,doyoucome after us/' Maru-tuahu then told
hisslave tomake apresent tothegirls ofthefood
theyhad collected, andhegavethem twobark
baskets ofpigeons, preserved intheirown fat,and
theywent offtotheir village with these. Maru-
tuahu stopped behind with hisslave, and assoon
asthe girlshad gone, hewent toastream, and
washed hishair inthewater, and then came
back, andcombed itvery carefully, and after
combing it,hetied itupinaknot, and stuck
fifty redKaka feathers inhishead, andamongst
them heplaced theplume ofawhite heron, and
the tailofahuia, asornaments;hethus looked
extremely handsome, and said tohisslave, "Now,
letusgo."
Itwasnotvery long before thetwoyoung girls
came backfrom thevillage tomeet their socalled
husband, thattheymight allgointogether ;and
when theycame uptohim, there hewasseated on

thetwoyoung girls feltdeeply inlovewithhim
when they saw liim, and they said toMaru',
"Come along toour father's village with us;''
andheagain consented, andtold hisslave tokeep
with them, and asthey allwent along, Maru'
stopped alittle until hewassomeway behind,
forhethought that the girlshadnotfound out
who hewas ;asthey proceeded, seeing that
Maru didnot follow them fast, they asked his
slave, who kept along with them,"What isthe
name ofyour master ?"andtheslave answered,
"Isthere nochief ofthewest coast ofthe
island whose fame hasreached this place ?"and
theyoung girls said,"Yes, thefame ofoneman
hasreached this place, thefame ofMaru-tuahu, the

together toHotunui, andtheir father TeWhatu, to
inform themwhowas coming, astheyhad pre-

should runquickly totellHotunui that hisson
was comincT, and that the eldest sister should
belefttoleadMaru-tuahu tothe village ;and
inthisway they proceeded, those who were
going slowly tothevillage loitering along, whilst
theyounger sister was farahead, running as
fastasshecould, andcrying outasshecame near
the village, "Areyou there,OHotunui ?here 's
your soncoming—here isMaru-tuahu." ThenHo-
tunui called outwith aloud voice, "Where ishe?"
and she replied, "Here hecomes, he iscoming
along close behind me ;make haste andhave the
floor ofthehouse covered with finemats forhim,
sothathemayhave afitting reception/'
Maru-tuahu soon came insight, and ashe
was seen approaching, helooked ashandsome as
thebeautiful crested cormorant. The people got
upon thedefences ofthe village, andranoutside
thegates, tolook athim;andtheyoung girls all
waved the corners oftheir cloaks, crying out,
"Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, make
haste, make haste;"andhestepped boldly out,
andreached thevillage. Assoon ashehad ar-
rived there, they allwept overhim;andwhen
they had done weeping, they satdown, and
formed asemicircle, with iMaru-tualiu atthe
open part ;andHotunui stood uptomake aspeech
ofwelcome tohisson,andhespoke thus :"Wei-

come, welcome, oh,my child, welcome toHauraki,
welcome. You arevery welcome. You have
suddenly appeared here,urged byyourown affec-
tions. You arevery welcome.'' Having said
this,Hotunui satdown again ;then Maru-tuahu
jumped uptomake aspeech inreply, andhesaid,
"That isright, that isright, oh,my father, call
outtoyour child,'You arewelcome.' Here Iam
arrived atHauraki, here Iamseeking outmy

Thus heended hisspeech, andafeastwasspread

tendogs forthe feast, andthe chiefs allate,and
thetwoyoung girls;but,although nooneknew it,
thetwo sisters were allthetime quarrelling with
each other astowhich ofthem should haveMaru-
tuahu forahusband: theheart ofoneofthem
whispered toher,heshall bemine;buttheheart
oftheother young girlsaid just thesame thing
toher.
The feast being ended, they leftthecommon

theevening came onafirewas kindled inthe
house, andtheeldest girlnotseeing heryounger
sister, Avent toherfather toask forher,andwas
toldthat shehadbeen given asawife toMaru-
tuahu. Atthisshewasexceedingly vexed, and
provoked with her sister ;foralthough shewas
plain, shethought toherself, Iamvery pretty,
and Iamsure, there's nottheleast reason why
Maru-tuahu should befrightened atme;and she
went offtoquarrel with heryounger sister ;but
Mara-tuahu didnot likeherupon account ofher
plainness, andherpretty sister kepthim asher
husband.
TePaka, thesonofHotunui, thenephew ofTe
Whatu, and theyounger brother ofMaru-tuahu,
hadgrown uptobeayoung man, sothey gave
him theelder daughter ofTeWhatu tobehis
wife;thus theelder sister wasmarried, aswell as
theyoung one,whowasgiven toMaru-tuahu for
hiswife;andTePaka's wifeborehimadaughter,
whom they called TeKahureremoa.
The youngest daughter ofTeWhatu, whom
Maru-tuahu married, bore him three children,
Tama-te-po, Tama-te-ra, andWhanaunga ;from
Tama-te-po sprang theNgati-Pongou tribe;from
Tama-te-ra sprang the tribe ofNgati-Tama-te-ra,
andfromWhanaunga sprang theNgati-Whanaunga
tribe.


STORY OFMARU-TUAHU. 255
Whilst Maru-tualiu was living atHauraki, his
father Hotunui toldhimhowvery badly some of
thepeople ofthat place had treated him;these
were thefacts ofthecase, astheoldchief related
them tohim.—"Oneday,when thecanoes ofthe
tribecame infulloffish, after hauling their nets,
hesentdown oneofhisservants from hishouse
tothecanoe tobring back some fish forhim,
andwhen theservant randown forthis purpose,
themanwho owned the nets said tohim,
'Well, what brings youhereVupon which his
servant answered,'Hotunui sentmedown, to
bring upsome fishforhim,hequite longs totaste
them/ Upon which theowner ofthenets cursed
Hotunui inthemost violent and offensive manner,
saying,'Ishishead theflax thatgrows inthe
swamp atOtoi ?orishistopknot flax, that the
oldfellow cannot gothere togetsome flax tomake
anetforhimself with, instead oftroubhng me?'
When Hotunui's servant heard this,hereturned at
once tothehouse, and hismaster notseeing the
fish, said,'Well, tellmewhat isthematter ;'so
hereplied,*Iwent asyou toldme,and Iasked
themanwhohadbeen hauling thenetforsome
fish ;andheonly looked upatme. Again I
asked him forsome fish;andthen hesaid,Who
sentyou here tofetch fish,pray? Then Itold
him,Hotunui sentmedown tobring upsome fish

forhim, liequite longs totaste them;then the
man cursed you,saying tome,IsHotunui's head
theflax thatgrows intheswamp atOtoi ;oris
histopknot flax, that theoldfellow cannot go
there, togetsome flax tomake anetwith for
himself?'"
When Hotunui had told this story toMaru-
tuahu, hesaid, "Now oh,myson, this tribe isa
verybad one,theyseem bentupon lowering the
authority oftheir chiefs."
Theheart ofMaru-tuahu feltverygloomy when
heheard hisfather hadbeen treated thus, and
Hotunui said tohim, "Youmaywelllook sad,my
son,athearing what Ihave just said;this tribe is
composed ofverybad people/' AndMaru-tuahu
replied, "Leave them alone, they shall findoutwhat
suchconduct leads to."
Then Maru-tuahu began tocatch and (\.vjgreat
quantities offish forafeast,andheworked awaywith
hismen atmaking fishing-nets, until hehad col-
lected avery great number ;itwas inthewinter
thathebegan tomake these nets,and thewinter,
spring, summer, andpart ofautumn passed, before
theywere finished;then hesentamessenger to
thetribewhohadcursed hisfather, toaskthem to
come toafeast, and tohelphim tostretch these
nets ;andwhen themessenger came back, Maru-
tuahu asked him, "Where arethey ?"andthemes-


STORY OFMARU-TUAHU. 257
senger answered, "Theday after to-morrow they
will arrive here/' Then Maru-tnahu gave orders,
saying, "To-morrow letthe feast beranged in
rows, sothatwhen they arrive heretheymay find
itallready forthem/' Upon thisthey allretired
torest,andwhen thedawn appeared theyarranged
thefood tobegiven tothestrangers inrows :the
outside oftherowswascomposed offishpiledup;
butunder thesewasplaced nothing butrotten wood
and filth, although theexterior made averygoodly
show. Heintended this feast tobeafeast at
which thosewhocame asguests should beslaugh-
tered, inrevenge forthecurse against Hotunui,
which hadexceedingly pained hisheart.
Soon after daybreak thenext morning the
guests came, and seeing the piles ofprovisions
which were laid out forthem, they were ex-
ceedingly rejoiced, and longed forthetime of
their distribution, andwhen they might touch
this food, little thinking how dearly they were
topay for it.The guests had allarrived and
taken their seatsupon thegrass,when Marutuahu
and hispeople came together;—they were only
onehundred and forty.
Astheywere tostretch thegreat netmade up
ofallthesmall onesupon thenext morning, on
that evening they put allthenetsand ropes

flaxofwliicli theywere made, sothat tbeymight
bemore easily stretched ;andwhen themorning-
dawned thosewhohadcome forthepurpose began
todraw outthenet, stretching theropeandthe
bottom ofthenetalong theground, andpegging it
tightdown from corner tocorner, andthus whilst
Maru-tuahu's people were preparing food forthem
toeat,theothers worked away atstretching the
nettaut,andpegging itfasttotheground tohold
it;itwasnotlong before tlieyhad finished this
andhadputontheweights tosink it.
Maru-tuahu sentaman toseewhether theyhad
finished stretching the net,andwhen theman
came back, hesaid, "Have theydone stretching the
net?" and theman answered, "Yes, they have
finished.'' Then Maru-tuahu said, "Letusgoand
lifttheupper endofthenetfrom theground;—they
have finished thelower endof it.''Then theone
hundred and fortymenwent with him, each one
carrying aweapon, carefully concealed under his
garments, lest their guests should seethem;and
when they reached theplace where thenetwas,
theyfound theguests, nearly athousand innum-
ber,had finished stretching thelower endofthe
net. Then thepriest ofMaru-tuahu whowas to
consecrate thenetsaid, "Lettheupper endofthe
netberaised, sothat thenetmay bestretched
straight out;"andMaru-tuahu said, "Yes, let it

bedone atonce, itisgetting late intheday/'
Then theonehundred and fortymen began to
liftupthe net,with the lefthand they seized
theropes toraise it,butwith theright hand
each firmly grasped hisweapon, andMaru-tuahu
shouted out, "Liftaway, hftaway, lift itwell
up;''when theyhad raised ithigh inthe air,
theywalked onwith it ;holding itupasifthey
were spreading itout, until they got itwell over
thestrangers, whowere either pegging thelower
enddown, orwere seated ontheground looking
on;thenMaru-tuahu shouted out, "Let itfall;"
andthey let itfall,andcaught inittheir guests,
nearly athousand innumber ;theycaught every
one ofthem inthe net, sothat they could not
move tomake any effectual resistance, andwhilst
some oftheonehundred and fortymen ofMaru-
tuahu held thenetdown, therest sleAvwith their
weapons thewhole thousand, notoneescaped, whilst
they lostnotasingle man themselves. Hence
"The feast ofrotten wood" isaproverb amongst
thedescendants ofMaru-tuahu tothisday. This
feast ofrotten wood wasgiven ataplace which
wasthennamed Pukeahau, butwhich was after-
wards called Karihitangata (or,men w^ere the
weights which were attached tothenettosink
it),upon account ofthethousand people whowere

people, thecountry they inhabited became thepro-
perty ofMaru-tuahu, and hisheirs dwell there to
thepresent day.
About thetime thatTeKahureremoa, Paka's
daughter, became marriageable, alarge party of
visitors arrived atWharekawa, thevillage ofTe
Paka ;theycame from Aotea, ortheGreat Barrier
Island ;attheir head was the principal chief
ofAotea, andhebrought inhiscanoes apresent of
twohundred andsixty baskets ofmackerel forTe
Paka, andtheybecame suchgood friends, thatthey
thought theywould like tobeconnected ;soit
wasarranged thatTePaka's daughter, TeKahu-
reremoa, should begiven asawife tothesonof
that chief; part ofTePaka's planwas toget
possession ofAotea forhisfamily, forhethought
when hisdaughter had children, andthey were
grown up,that itwas possible theywould secure
theisland fortheir grandfather, orfortheir mother's
family.
When theparty ofvisitors wasabout toreturn
toAotea, having formed thisconnection withTe
Paka's tribethrough the girl, her ftither gave her
uptothem totake toAotea toherhusband, and
hetold hisdaughter togoonboard thecanoe, and
toaccompany them toAotea ;buthetold herto

reremoa with herfather, andpaddled offintheir
canoes.
Inonemonth's time theycameback again, and
brought with them apresent ofthirty baskets
ofmackerel, and assoon asthey arrived they
distributed these amongst their friends ;anddown
ranTeKahureremoa fi'om the village tothe
landing-place totake abasket ofmackerel for
herself Assoon asPaka saw this, hegave his
daughter asound scolding forgoing andtaking
thefish;this iswhat Paka said tohisdaughter :
"Putthatdown, you shall nothave it ;Iwanted
you togoandbecome thewife oftheyoung
chief oftheplace where these good fishabound,
andyourefused togo,therefore you shall notnow
have any."'
Thiswas quite enough;poor little TeKahu-
reremoa feltentirely overcome with shame, she left
thebasket offish,dropping itjustwhere shewas,
andranback into thehouse, andbegan tosoband
cry;then herthoughts suggested toher,that after

this, itwould bebetter that sheshould beno
more seenbytheeyes ofherfather, andthat her
father's faceshould benomore seenbyher,and
herheart kept onurging her torunaway to

Asshethought ofallthis, the chief's young

house, quite overcome with shame, andwhen
evening came shewas still crying, but atnight,
shesaid toherself, "Now I'llbe off,whilst all

THETWOSOECERERS,
(kOTEMATENGA KIKI.)
KiKl wasacelebrated sorcerer, and skilled in
magical arts ;lielived upon the river Waikato.
Theinhabitants ofthat river stillhave thisproverb,
"Theoffspring ofKiki v^rither shrubs/' This pro-
verbhad itsorigin inthecircumstance ofKiki
being suchamagician, thathecould notgoabroad
inthesunshine;forifhisshadow fellupon any
place notprotected from hismagic, itatonce be-
came tapu, and alltheplants there withered.
This Kikiwasthoroughly skilled intheprac-
tice ofsorcery. Ifany parties coming upthe
river called athisvillage intheir canoes asthey
paddled by,he stillremained quietly athome,
and never troubled himself tocome out,but
justdrew back the sliding door ofhishouse,
sothat itmight stand open, and thestrangers

dlingdown from theupper parts oftheriver, he

dow ofhishouse, andthecrews onboard ofthem
were sure todie.
Atlength, thefame ofthis sorcerer spread ex-
ceedingly, andresounded through every tribe, until
Tamure, achiefwho dwelt atKawhia, heard with
others, reports ofthemagical powers ofKiki, for
hisfame extended over theAvhole country. At
length Tamure thought hewould goandcontend
intheartsofsorcery with Kiki, that itmight be
seen Avhich ofthemwasmost skilled inmagic ;and
hearranged inhisownmind afortunate season for
hisvisit.
When thistime came, heselected two ofhis
people ashiscompanions, andhetook hisyoung
daughter withhim also;andthey allcrossed over
themountain range from Kawhia, andcamedown
upon theriverWaipa, which runs into theWai-
kato, andembarking there inacanoe, paddled
down theriver towards thevillage ofKiki ;and
theymanaged sowell, that before theywere seen
byanybody, theyhadarrived atthelanding-place.
Tamure was notonly skilled inmagic, buthe
was also avery cautious man ;sowhilst they
were still afloat upon the river, herepeated anin-
cantation ofthekind called "Mata-tawhito,'' to
preserve him safefrom allartsofsorcery;andhe
repeated other incantations, toward offspells, to

hiiHj tokeep offevil spirits, andtosliielcl himfrom
demons;when these preparations were allfinished,
they landed, anddrewuptheir canoe onthebeach,
atthelanding-place ofKiki.
Assoon astheyhad landed, theoldsorcerer
called outtothem that theywerewelcome tohis
village, andinvited them tocomeuptoit;sothey
went uptothevillage :andwhen they reached
thesquare inthe centre, they seated themselves
upon theground ;andsome ofKiki's people
kindled fireinanenchanted oven, andbegan to
cook food initforthestrangers. Kiki satinhis
house, andTamure ontheground just outside the
entrance to it,andhethere availed himself of
thisopportunity torepeat incantations over the
threshold ofthehouse, sothatKikimight been-
chanted ashestepped over ittocome out.When
thefood intheenchanted ovenwas cooked, they
pulled offthecoverings, andspread itoutupon
clean mats. The oldsorcerer nowmade hisap-
pearance outofhishouse, andheinvited Tamure
tocome and eatfood with him ;but thefood
was allenchanted, and hisobject inasking Ta-
mure toeatwithhimwas, that theenchanted
foodmight killhim;therefore Tamure saidthat his
young daughter wasvery hungiy, andwould eat
ofthefood offered tothem;heinthemeantime
kept onrepeating incantations ofthekind called


276 POLYNESIAN MYTHOLOGY.
Mata-tawhito, Whakangungu, andParepare^ protec-
tions against enchanted food, and assheateshe
also continued torepeat them ;evenwhen she
stretched outherhand totakeasweet potato, or
anyother food, shedropped thegreater part ofit
ather feet,andhid itunder her clothes, andthen
only atealittle bit. After shehad done, the
old sorcerer, Kiki, kept waiting forTamure to
begin toeat also oftheenchanted food, that
hemight soon die. Kiki having gone into his
house again, Tamure still satontheground out-
side the door, and ashehad enchanted the
threshold ofthehouse, henow repeated incan-
tations which might render thedoor enchanted
also, sothatKiki might becertain nottoescape
when hepassed outofitBythistimeTamure's
daughter hadquite finished hermeal, butneither
herfather noreither ofhispeople hadpartaken of
theenchanted food.
Tamure now ordered hispeople tolaunch his
canoe, andthey paddled away, andalittle time
after they had leftthe village, Kiki became un-
well;inthemeanwhile, Tamure and hispeople
were paddling homewards inallhaste, and as
they passed avillage where there were agood
many people onthe river's bank, Tamure stopped,
and said tothem, "Ifyoushould seeanycanoe
puUino- after us,and thepeople inthecanoe ask

you,haveyouseenacanoe passuptheriver,would
youbegood enough tosay, 'Yes, acanoe has

farhas itgot?' would youbegoodenough tosay,
'Oh,bythistime ithasgotvery farupthe
riverV"andhaving thus said tothepeople of
that village, Tamure paddled away again inhis
canoe with allhaste.
Some time after Tamure's party had leftthe
village ofKiki, theoldsorcerer became very ill
indeed, and hispeople thenknew that thishad
beenbrought about bythemagical artsofTamure,
andthey sprang intoacanoe tofollow after him,
andpulled uptheriver ashard asthey could; and
when they reached thevillage where thepeople
wereontheriver's bank, they called outandasked
them, "How farhas thecanoe reached, which
passed uptheriverVandthevillagers answered,
"Oh,that canoe must have gotvery farupthe
riverbythis time.'' Thepeople inthecanoe that
waspursuing Tamure, upon liearing this, returned
again totheirown village, andKiki diedfrom the
incantations ofTamure.
Some ofKiki's descendants are still living—
oneofthem,named Mokahi, recently died atTau-
ranga-a-Ruru, butTeMaioha isstill living onthe
river Waipa. Yes, some ofthedescendants of
Kiki, whose shadow withered trees, are still living.

THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD,
(kongapumiapuarata eaua kotautohito.)
This head bewitched allpersons whoapproached
the hillwhere the fortress inwhich itwaskept
was situated, sothat, from fear of it,nohuman
being dared toapproach theplace, which wasthence
named theSacred Mount.
Upon thatmount dwelt Puarata andTautohito
with their carved head, and itsfamewent through
allthecountry, totheriver Tamaki, and toKai-
para,and tothe tribes ofNgapuhi, toAkau, to
Waikato, toKawhia, toMokau, toHauraki, and
toTauranga ;theexceeding great fame ofthe
powers ofthat carved head spread toevery part
ofAotea-roa, orthenorthern island ofNew Zea-
land;everywhere reports were heard, that sogreat
were itsmagical powers, none could escape alive
fromthem;andalthough many warriors andarmies
went totheSacred Mount totrytodestroy the
sorcerers towhom thehead belonged, andtocarry
itoffasagenius fortheirown district, that its

magical powers might besubservient tothem,
they allperished intheattempt. Inshort, no
mortal could approach the fortress, and live;
even parties ofpeople whowere travelling along
theforest track, tothenorthwards towards Muri-
whenua, alldiedbythemagical powers ofthat
head ;Avhether theywent inlargearmed bodies, or
simply asquiet travellers, their fatewasalike—they
allperished, from itsmagical influence, somewhere
about theplacewhere thebeaten track passes over
Waimatuku.
Thedeaths ofsomany persons created agreat
sensation inthecountry, and, atlast, thereport of
these things reached averypowerful sorcerer named
Hakawau, who, confiding inhismagical arts, said
hewasresolved togoandseethismagic head, and
thesorcerers whoowned it.So,without delay, he
called upon allthegeniiwhowere subservient to
him, inorder that hemight bethrown intoan
enchanted sleep,andseewhat hisfateinthisunder-
taking would be ;and inhisslumber hesawthat
hisgenius would triumph intheencounter, for it
was soloftyandmighty, that inhisdream itshead
reached theheavens, whilst itsfeetremained upon
earth.
Having byhisspells ascertained this,heatonce
started onhisjourney, and the district through
which hetravelled wasthatofAkau;and,confiding


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 281
inhisownenchantments, hewent fearlessly totry
v/hether hisartsofsorcery would notprevail over
themagic head, andenable him todestroy theold
sorcerer Puarata.
Hetookwithhimone friend, andwent along
thesea-coast towards theSacred Mount, andpassed
through Whanga-roa, andfollowed the sea-shore
toBangikahu andKuhawera, andcame outupon
thecoast again atKaroroumanui, and arrived
atMaraetai ;there was afortified village, the
people ofwhich endeavoured todetain Hakawau
and hisfriend until they rested themselves and
partook ofalittle food;buthesaid, "Weatefood
ontheroad, ashort distance behind us;weare
notatallhungry orweary/' Sotheywould not
remain atMaraetai, butwent straight onuntil
they reached Putataka, andthey crossed theriver
there, andproceeded along thebeach toRukuwai;
neither didthey stop there, butonthey went,
and atlastreached Waitara.
When they gottoWaitara, thefriend who ac-
companied Hakawau began togetalarmed, and
said,"Now we shall perish here, Ifear;'' but
theywent safely on,andreached TeWeta ;there

safety, andonthey went, and atlength they
reached themost fatal place ofall—Wainiatuku.
Here they smelt thestench ofthecarcases ofthe
numbers whohadbeen previously destroyed ;indeed
thestench was sobadthat itwasquite suffocating,
andthey bothnow said, "This isafearful place;
wefearweshall perish here/' However, Haka-
wau keptonunceasingly working athisenchant-
ments, and repeating incantations, which might
ward offtheattacks ofevil genii, andwhich might
collect good genii about them, toprotect them from
themalignant spirits ofPuarata, lestthese should
injure them;thus they passed overWaimatuku,
looking with horror atthemany corpses strewed
about thebeach, andinthedense fernandbushes
which bordered thepath;andastheypursued their
onward journey, they expected death every mo-
ment.
Nevertheless they diednotonthedreadful road,
butwent straight along thepath tilltheycame to
theplace where itpasses oversome low hills,from
whence theycould seethefortress which stood upon
theSacred Mount. Here they satdown and
rested, forthe firsttime since theyhadcommenced
their journey. They hadnotyetbeen seenbythe
watchmen ofthe fortress. Then Hakawau, with
liisincantations, sent forthmany genii, toattack


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 283
the spirits who keptwatch over thefortress and
magic head ofPuarata. Some ofhisgood genii
were sentbyHakawau inadvance, whilst he
charged others tofollow atsome distance. The
incantations bythepower ofwhich these geniiwere
sentforthbyHakawau wasaWhangai. The genii
hesent infront were ordered immediately tobegin
the assault. Assoon asthe spirits whoguarded
the fortress ofPuarata saw the others, they all
issued outtoattack them;thegood genii then
feigned aretreat, the evil ones following them,
andwhilst they were thus engaged inthepur-
suit,some ofthethousands ofgood genii, who
had lastbeen sent forth byHakawau, stormed
thefortress now leftwithout defenders ;when the
evil spirits, whohadbeen ledaway inthepursuit,
turned toprotect the fortress, theyfound thatthe
genii ofHakawau hadalready gotquite close toit,
andthegood genii ofHakawau without trouble
caught them one after theother, andthus allthe
spirits oftheoldsorcerer Puarata were utterly
destroyed.
When allthe evil spirits whohadbeen subject
totheoldsorcerer hadbeen thus destroyed, Haka-
w^auwalked straight uptowards the fortress of
this fellow, inwhom spirits haddwelt asthick as
menstow themselves inacanoe, andwhom they

hadused inlikemanner tocanythem about. When
thewatchmen ofthe fortress, totheir great sur-
prise, sawstrangers coming, Puarata hurried tohis
magic head, tocallupon it;hissupplication was
after thismanner—"Strangers come here Istrangers
come here !Two strano-ers come 1two strano^ers
come!''But ituttered only alowwailing sound;
forsince thegood genii ofHakawau haddestro3^ed
the spirits who served Puarata, theoldsorcerer
addressed invain hissupplications tothemagic
head, itcould nolonger raise aloud itspowerful
voice asinformer times, bututtered onlylowmoans
andwails. Could ithave cried outwith aloud
voice, straightway Hakawau and hisfriend would
bothhave perished ;forthus itwas,when armies
and travellers had inother times passed the for-
tress, Puarata addressed supplications tohismagic
head, andwhen itcried outwith amighty voice,
thestrangers allperished astheyheard it.
Hakawau and hisfriend had, inthemeantime,
continued towalk straight tothe fortress. When
theydrew near it,Hakawau said tohisfriend,
"Yougodirectly along thepath that leadsby
thegateway into the fortress; asforme, Iwill
showmypower over theoldsorcerer, byclimbing
right over theparapet and palisades:'' andwhen
they reached the defences ofthe place, Haka-


THEMAGICAL WOODEN HEAD. 285
wau began toclimb over thepalisades ofthe
gateway. When thepeople oftheplacesaw this,
theyweremuch exasperated, anddesired him, in
anangry manner, topassunderneath thegateway,
along thepathway which wascommon toall,and
nottodare toclimb overthegateway ofPuarata and
ofTautohito; butHakawau went quietly onover
thegateway, without paying theleast attention to
theangry words ofthosewhowere calling outto
him, forhefeltquite surethat thetwooldsorcerers
were not soskilful inmagical arts ashewas;so
Hakawau persisted ingoing direct toallthemost
holy places ofthefortress, where noperson whohad
notbeenmade sacred might enter.
AfterHakawau and hisfriend hadbeen fora
short time inthe fortress, andhad rested them-
selves alittle, thepeople oftheplace began tocook
food forthem; they stillcontinued tositresting
themselves inthe fortress foralong time, and at
length Hakawau said tohisfriend, "Letusde-
part.'' Directly hisservant heard what hismaster
said tohim,hejumped upatonceandwasready
enough tobe off.Then thepeople oftheplace
called outtothem nottogoimmediately, butto
takesome food first ;butHakawau answered, "Oh,
weateonlyalittle while ago;not farfrom here
wetooksome food.'' SoHakawau would notre-
main longer inthefortress, butdeparted, and as

hestarted, besmote hishands onthethreshold of
thehouse inwhich theyhad rested, andtheyhad
hardly got Avell outside ofthefortress before every

(kotekorero mongapatupaiaeehe.)
Once "upon atime, aman ofthename ofKahu-

hadbeen cleaning mackerel, andhesawtheinside

Butwhen hecame tolookalittlemore narrowly

after observing everything well,hereturned tothe
house where hewas stopping. He,however, held

very striking totell allhisfriends inevery direc-
tion, and aslikely tobethemeans ofgaining
knowledge which might enable him tofind out
something new.
Sothat night hereturned totheplace where
hehad observed allthese things, and just as
hereached thespot,backhadcome the fidries too,
tohaul their netformackerel ;andsome ofthem

the fairies, asanencouragement intheir work, and
from thejoyoftheir hearts attheir sport in
fishing.
Asthefairies weredragging thenettotheshore,
Kahukura managed tomixamongst them, and
hauled away attherope ;hehappened tobea

hewasnotobserved bythem. A^thenetcame

themidst ofthem.
"Wlien the first fishreached theshore, thrown up
intheripples driven before thenetastheyhauled

Kahukura kept onstringing his fishwith the

taken offhisneck ornament, andpulled outhis
jasper ear-ring, and hisother ear-ring, made ofa

thinking itbetter thefairies should nottouch him,
hetook astick, and fixing itinto theground,
hung hisneck ornament and ear-rings upon it.
Assoon asthefairies hadended their song, they
took theshadows oftheear-rings, andhanded them

There was, several generations since, achief of
theTaranaki tribe,named Rangirarunga. Hispa
was called Whakarewa;itwas alarge pa,re-
nowned forthestrength ofitsfortifications. This
chiefhadavery beautiful daughter, whose name
wasRau-mahora;shewas socelebrated forher
beauty thatthefame ofithadreached allparts of
these islands, and had, therefore, come totheears
ofTeRangi-apitirua, achief oftheNgati-Awa
tribes, towhom belonged thepaofPuke-ariki, on
the hillwhere theGovernor's house stood inNew
Plymouth. This chief hadasonnamed Taka-
rangi ;hewas thehero ofhistribe. He, too,
naturally heard ofthebeauty ofRau-mahora;and
itmaybethat hisheart sometimes dwelt longon
thethoughts ofsuch great loveliness.
Now inthose days long past, there arose a
warbetween thetribes ofTeRangi-apitirua and
ofthefather ofRau-mahora ;andthearmy ofthe

Ngati-A.wa tribes marched toTaranaki, toattack
thepaofRangirarunga, and thearmy invested
that fortress, and satbefore itnight andday,yet
theycould nottake it ;theycontinued nevertheless
constantly tomake assaults upon it,andtoattack
thegarrison ofthefortress, sothat itsinhabitants
became worn outfromwant ofprovisions and
water, andmany ofthem were near dying.
Atlasttheoldchief ofthepa,Rangirarunga,
overcome bythirst, stood onthetopofthede-
fences ofthe pa,and cried outtothemen ofthe
enemy's army, "Iprayyou togivemeonedrop

man, said, "Yes;'' andoneranwith acalabash
togivehimwater. But themajority being more
hard-hearted, were angry atthis,andbroke the
calabash inhishands, sothatnotadrop ofwater
reached thepoor oldman;and thiswasdone se-

amongst themselves.
The old chief still stood onthetopofthe

There wasformerly alarge fortified town upon
Mount Eden; itsdefences were massive andstrong,
andagreatnumber ofpersons inhabited thetown.
Inthedays ofolden time awarwascommenced
bythetribes ofAwhitu andofWaikato, against the
people who inhabited thetown atMount Eden or
Maunga-whau.
There they engaged inafierce war :one side
first persisted intheir efforts forvictory, until they
were successful inbeating theother party ;then the
other sideintheir turn succeeded inresisting their
enemies, andgained avictory intheir turn;thus
the tribes ofWaikato didnotsucceed indestroy-
ingtheir enemies asthey desired.
After this thepeople ofWaikato thought, fora
long time, "Well, what hadwebetter donow
todestroy these enemies ofours?''' And seeing no
way toaccomplish this,theydetermined tomake

peace withthem;so,atlast,theyarranged apeace,
and itappeared tobeasure one.
When thispeace hadbeen made, TePonga, a
chief from Awhitu, andone ofthe fiercest ene-
mies ofthepeople ofthattown, went, attended by
alarge company, toMaunga-whau, andwhilst he
wasyetalongway off,heand hisparty were seen
coming along bythepeople ofthe fortified town,
andthey rantothegates ofthefortress, calling
out, "Welcome, oh,welcome, strangers from afar!''
andtheywaved their garments tothem ;and the
strangers, encouraged bythese cries, came straight
ontothetown until they reached it,andthen
walked direct tothelarge court-yard infront of
thehouse ofthechief ofthetown, andthere thev
allseated themselves.
The inhabitants being allnow assembled in
thetown, aswell asthe strangers, the chiefs of
each party stood upandmade speeches, andwhen
theyhadconcluded thispart oftheceremony, the
women lighted fires tocook food fortliestrangers,
andwhen theovens were heated, they put the

The strangers, however, atevery slowly, know-

Then thedancers began, andwhilst theysprang

Then, just astheywere allbeating time toge-

come, and forth shesprang before theassembled
dancers;first shebends herheadwithmany ges-
tures towards thepeople upon theone side,and
then towards those upon the other, asshe per-
formed herpart beautifully; her fullorbed eyes
seemed clearand brilliant asthe fullmoon rising
inthehorizon, andwhilst thestrangers looked at
theyoung girl,they allwere quite overpowered with
herbeauty;andTePonga, theiryoung chief, felt
hisheart grow wild with emotion, when hesaw so
much loveliness before him. Inthemeanwhile the
people ofthevillage went ondancing, until allthe
evolutions ofthedance were duly completed, when
they paused.
Thenupsprang thestrangers todance intheir
turn, andthey duly ranged themselves inorder,
rank behind rank ofthedancers, andbegan with
their hands tobeat time, and whilst they thus
gave thetime ofthemeasure, theyoung chief,
TePonga, stood peeping overthemandwaiting a
good opportunity forhim tospring forward, andin

indeed, heperformed beautifully! The people of
the village were sosurprised athisagility and
grace, thatthey could donothing butadmire him,
and asfortheyoung girlPuhihuia, herheart con-
ceived awarm passion forTePonga.
Atlength thedance concluded, and alldis-
persed, each totheplace where hewas torest;
then, overcome with weariness, they allreclined

-'Where 's

Ah !youwillnothearwhen youdonot like,but
I'llbreak yourhead foryou,myfine fellow.'''
Thus the slave advised hismaster, andthey
arranged fully theplan oftheir proceedings;the
next dayTePonga went tovisit the chief of
the village, and satinhishouse watching the
young girl,and before longevening closed in,and
they retired torest,andsome time afterwards Te
Ponga, pretending tobethirsty, called outloudly
tothis slave, "Halloa !sir,fetchmesome water ;"
butnotaword didtheslave answer him;and
TePonga continued tocallout tohim louder
and louder, until atlastheseemed tobecome
weary ofshouting. When thechief ofthevillage
heard him calling outinthisway forwater, heat

arose, and, taking acalabash, went offtofetch
water;andnosooner didTePonga seeher start-
incroffthan hetoo arose, andwent outofthe
house, feigning byhisvoice andwords tobevery
angry with hisslave, sothat allmight think he

theyoung girl ;hedidnot,indeed, wellknow the
pathwhich ledtothefountain, butledbythevoice
ofthemaiden, who tripped along thepath singing

theguidance ofhertones.
When themaiden arrived atthebrink ofthe
fountain andwasabout todiphercalabash into it,
sheheard some onebehind her,and,turning sud-

replied, "Ha,indeed !DidnotIcome here todraw

byher side,andthey conversed together, and to
each ofthem thewords oftheother seemed most

Before they separated they arranged atimewhen
theymight escape together, andthen each ofthem
returned tothevillage towait fortheoccasion they
had agi'eed upon.
When theappointed timehadarrived, hedesired

the plugs, sothat those following them might be
checked andthrown into confusion atfinding they
hadnocanoes inwhich tocontinue the jDursuit.
Those ofhispeople towhom TePonga gave these
orders immediately departed, and didexactly as
their chiefhaddirected them.
Thenextmorning TePonga having toldhishost

andwhen theyhad allcollected, thechief ofthe

sented hisjademere toTePonga asaparting gift,
which might establish andmake sure thepeace
which theyhadconcluded. TePonga inhisturn

accompanied them tothegates ofthefortress to

Imust firstremark thatwhilewehave, properly speak-
ing,onlyonescale ofmusical notes andtwogenera, the
Greeks hadthree scales and fivegenera. Forwehave
onlythediatonic scale, butbyacertain introduction ofone
ormore semitones, wemake what iscalled thechromatic.
Whereas, theGreeks hadthree scales, comprising five
genera, or,according tosome, nine* alldiffering notonly,
asours do,intheposition ofintervals, butintheintervals

tionofinterval) gave rise totheexpression "genera ofa
system,'' anddepended onthedistribution oftwointerme-
diate sounds inthetetrachord or4th.
The principal scales andgenera were three; the dia-
tonic, thechromatic, andtheenharmonic. The diatonic
(genus) consisted ofalimma orminor half tone, amajor
tone,andamajor tone ascending, thishadanother modi-
fication, bjwhich, while itretained thesame semitone, it
contracted thenext tone,andextended thelast; thelatter
wascalled softdiatonic.
The chromatic, which consisted ofsemitone, semitone,
onetoneandahalf interval, ornearly ourminor third,
was called tonaoson, andhadtwo modifications, one
called hemiolion, andtheother malakon ;these shades or
modifications seem oflater invention, andsoon tohave
fallen into disuse.
Theenharmonic consisted ofaquarter tone, aquarter
toneandaninterval oftwotones, aninterval somewhat
greater than ourthird major.
Wallis says thatwehave noidea ofthese intervals at
thepresent day, asinanywayconnected with ascale, since
theyamount tolittlemore thananimperfect elevation or

ancients could notaccompany theenharmonic) forget that
iftheycanaccompany greater intervals which were com-posed ofless, there canbenoreason whythescale ofaninstrument might notbesoadjusted astoaccompany the
lessintervals which compose those greater.
Thedoubt ofthepossibility ofusing theenharmonic asascale isnotconfined toourown day,forPlutarch, aswehave seen (and inother places also), speaks ofthedecline
ofIt;andAthenj£us speaks ofcertain Greeks who, from
time totime, retired bythemselves tokeepuptherecol-
lection ofthegood oldmusic, since thearthadbecome so
corrupted.
InPlutarch's time (deMusica) hebitterly complains
that certain people -a^rmed theenharmonic diesis tohe

toprove itweremere triflers (TtEtpTwocpy^Kivcci).^
Hethenmakes theremark about thepossibility ofac-
companying theenharmonic intervals with instruments,
andadds, "andthese verypeople whotalkabout theen-
harmonic having nofoundation innature, have anextra-
ordinary attachment todissonances andirrational intervals"
(tTf^ittx ,..ncixoyoc), wliich liavc noexistence inthereal
science oftheproportions ofnatural intervals, andmaybe
compared tocertain irregular tenuities orawkward excres-
cences onwhat should beabeautiful tree orother object.
Forwhatever reason, itappears itwaswholly laidaside in
Plutarch's time, which heattributes tothedulness ofthe
earsofthose ofhisday.
Wallis supposes thegenera ofthechromatic andenhar-
monic tohave fallen intodisuse formany ages ;Scaliger,
not tillDomitian :theenharmonic, because oftheextreme
difficulty; thechromatic, onaccount ofitssoftness and
effeminacy. Dr.Wallis adds, "modern music never
affected toappreciate such subtilty anddelicate nicety, for
neither voice could execute, noreareasily distinguish so
minute differences, atleast sowesuppose now-a-days."
Dr.Burney (i.433), inhisHistory ofMusic, from vari-
ousauthorities, concludes that thisgenus (the closeenhar-
monic) wasalmost exclusively inusebefore Aristoxenus
(about thetime ofAlexander theGreat), andwegather
from Aristoxenus that there were exercises initforprac-
tice,and thisobservation iscorroborated inthe"Notices

paper, byMr.Vincent, from certain MSS. intheKing of
France's library.
Dr.Burney, incommon withmost othermodern writers
onthe subject, says, "theintervals ofthe close enhar-
monic tetrachord
3±ifeS122:
appear wholly strange andunmanageable," andhence it
hasbeen concluded thattheenharmonic wasimpossible in
practice.
Dr.Burney, however, onedayreceived aletter from his
friend Dr.Russell, regarding the"state ofmusic inAra-
bia,and totheDoctor's utter astonishment, helearnt from
that letter thattheArabian scale ofmusic wasdivided into
quarter tones; andthatanoctave, which, upon ourkeyed
instruments isonly divided into12semitones, intheAra-
bian scale contained 24.,forallofivhich theyhadparticular
denomhiations.''
This latter observation would seem totally very well
withwhat Mr.Lane* says ofthecanoon (xav^v) ofthe
present Arabs, which, hesays, has24treble notes. Only,
thatheadds, eachnotehasthree strings toit,which (later,
asweshall see)heaffirms tohavebeen thirds oftones. If
so,thesystem isashade ofthechromatic ;and ifMr.
Lane isright (andhegives adrawing oftheinstrument),
Dr.Russell must err,orspeak ofanother instrument. I
should beinclined togive preference toLane, because of
thegreat pains hehastaken indescribing theinstrument.

says, that'*itisimpossible toobtain theintervals oftheir
scaleonourkeyed instruments, buttheymaybeperfectly
effected ontheviolin."
Mr.Vincent* gives amost scientific description ofan
elaborate instrument made atParis, exhibited attheIn-
stitut, onwhich thequarter tones were most correctly
illustrated, andobserves, that amuch less interval than
thequarter-tone, perhaps eight ortentimes less, isdis-
cernible, asproved byaM.Delezenne,f 1827; andour
own ears attest thatuniversally inthemodulations ofthe
voice oftheso-called savage tribes, andintherefined and
anomalously-studied Chinese, there areintervals which do
notcorrespond toanynotes onourkeyed instruments, and
which toanuntrained earappear almost monotonous.
There isanother matter withwhich incidentally wehave
todo,namely, anapparent difference ofopinion between
ancient authors themselves about theenharmonic. Plu-
tarchtsays thatAristoxenus (inabook notnowextant)
informs usthatOlympus wastheinventor ofanenhar-
monic, butofakind consisting ofascale inwhich certain
notes, the"lichani" or"indicatrices," were omitted, and
that the airs ofOlympus were sosimple and beautiful,
that there wasnothing likethem.

This Scale would approximate totheScotch, orrather
tothatgiven asChinese byDr.Russell. §
Butthere isnothing repugnant inthis, tothedivision
oftheintermediate half-note between thissaltus ;and, as

Suffice ittosay, thatmany Chinese airs, ofwhich I

which Ihave heard aresofter andmore "ligate,'' and
have agreat predominance ofthediesic element.

Ifanywish toexamine thismatter more closely, they
canconsult theTreatises onHarmonics. Mr.Vincent has
calculated these differences bylogarithms tothe60root
of2.
Mypoint is,toprove that theancients didpossess and
practise amodulation which contained much less intervals
than ours,andthatsuch, oranapproach tosuch, modula-
tion (though probably butimperfect) isstill retained
among some people, and that theprinciples onwhich the
Greeks founded their enharmonic genus, still survive in
natural song, though Iwillnotbeboldenough toassert
thatsometimes these songs may notchange intooneof
thechromaticx?°^'*» which, forwant ofpractice, Imight
notbeable todecide. Onething, however, iscertain, that,
asAristoxenus tells us,noperfect earcould modulate
more than twodieses atatime (andthen there wasa
''saltus'' orinterval oftwotones), and astheNew Zea-
landsongs frequently exhibit more than twoclose intervals
together, itismore than probable thatmany ofthese
songs areachromatic, represented by120, 114, 108, or
120,112J,108 ;but itwillnotbeworth while forthepre-
sent purpose todiscuss this nicety, asallwewant isa
practical approximation.

Still survives, Ishall produce, asnearly asmyearcould
discern, themodulation ofsome oftheNew Zealand
melodies;and shall show astillnearer approach tothe
system oftherealGreek enharmonic, inaChinese air
which Iheard andnoted.
Afewremarks onthesystem itself, theintervals, and
thenotation.
SYSTEM.
First, thatanenharmonic modulation might exist is
admitted bymany modern writers. Mr.Donkin, forin-
stance, author oftheable article onAncient Music in
Dr.W.Smith's "Dictionary ofGreek andEoman Anti-
quities," observes (under thetitleof"Music") ofthediffer-
entgenera lessfrequently named,* "that itwould be
wrong toconclude hastily thattheothers would beimpos-
sible inpractice, ornecessarily unpleasing;"andoftheen-
harmonic hesays, "butitisimpossible toform ajudgment
ofitsmerits without amuch greater knowledge ofthe
rules ofcomposition thanseems nowattainable."
Mr.LayTradescant having shown thedifferences of
interval oftheChinese instruments from theintervals
generally inuseinEurope, adds—"Itwill therefore
very readily appear from therespective rules, that the
character ofthemusic, or,ifyou please, themood (he
should have said "genus "),must bevery different from
ourown, and thatnone ofourinstruments (heshould
have said keyed orbored) arecapable ofdoing jus-
tice toany airthat isplayed onthekin" (orscholar's
lute). Hesubjoins :"Inmytravels Isometimes uTote
down the airs that Ihadheard among thenatives, but
though Itookmuch pains tolearn them accurately, I

matic.


324 APPENDIX.
always found theyhad lostsomething oftheir peculiarity
when played upon theviolin.
"Thereason ofthisdefect seems tohavebeen thatthe
intervals oftheIndian music didnotagree with those of
Europe."*
Mr. Tradescant might have added, that there will
always besome difference iuanairplayed ontheguitar
andontheviolin, though theintervals used areesteemed
thesame ;and, again, perhaps thelearned traveller did
nottake care todivide thescale ofhisviolin mathemati-
cally, likethat ofthekin, before hetried the eff'ect ;he
might alsonothave noted theright interval. Hecon-
cludes :"There is,however, aconnection between theChi-
neseand oldScotch music, sothatwhen anyhighly-ad-
mired airsofScotland happen tofallwithin thecompass
ofthekin,theyseem athome when played upon this in-
strument."
Mr.Lane saysthe"canoon" oftheArabians hadtwenty-
fournotes. Dr.Russell toBurney saysthattheArab scale
oftiventy-four notes wasequal toone octave. ButMr.
Lane adds, that "themost remarkable peculiarity inthe
Arab system ofmusic isthedivision oftones into thirds.'"
Hence, fromthesystem ofthirds oftones, Ihaveheard the
Egyptian musicians urge against theEuropean systems of
music thatthey aredeficient inthenumber ofsounds.
Thesame remark wasmade tomebySelim Agar, a
Nubian, when singing someAmharic songs: "Your instru-
ment" (piano), said he,"isverymuch outoftune, and
jumps very much.''
Mr.Lane adds :'*These small anddelicate gradations of
sound giveapeculiar softness totheperformances ofthe
Arab musicians, which aregenerally ofajjlaintive cha-
*LayTradescant's'•'Chinese astheyAre."


APPENDIX. 325
racier; butthey are difficult todiscriminate with exact-
ness, and therefore seldom observed inthevocal and
instrumental music ofthose persons whohavenotmade a
regular study oftheart."
HadMr.Lane been describing thecharacter and diffi-
culties oftheancient Greek enharmonic orchromatic, he
could nothave used other terms; they arealmost the
words ofAristoxenus, Vitruvius, Plutarch, andother an-
cient writers onthese genera; and yet,headds,"hetook
great delight inthemore refined kind ofmusic," and
found "themore hebecame habituated tothestyle the
more hewaspleased with it."Hecontinues :"Hewas
perfectly charmed with theperformance ofsome female
singers, andthatthenatives aresofascinated astolavish
considerable sums onthem."
Precisely sotheGreeks ofold.
INTEEVALS.
Wemust notsuppose thattheGreek enharmonic wasa
consecutive gamut ofquarter-tones— no ;wearetold dis-
tinctly byallauthors (except, perhaps, Salinas), thatthere
wasaquarter-tone, then another quarter-tone, then'a
great interval completing thefourth;orreversely, agreat
interval oftwomajor tones, orabout ourthird major, the
quarter-tone, another quarter-tone, thus completing the
fourth.
Sowith these nations, andespecially intheChinese
airs Ihave heard, there iseither thetwoquarter-tones,
then aninterval ofabout athird ;or,theinterval ofthe
third, andthen thetwodieses orquarter-tones, oritisa
mixed genus, andadds atone orhalf-tone ateither
extreme.

voured togiveanidea ofthose airsofNewZealand which
Iheard, yetsodifficult isittodiscover theexact interval,
that Iwillnotvouch forthemathematical exactness :nei-
ther will Ipledge myself not tohave written achromatic
foranenharmonic interval, orvice,versa.
Imust also, injustice tomyself, add,that thesinger
didnotalways repeat themusical phrase with precisely
thesame modulation, though, without avery severe test,
thiswould nothave been discernible, northen tomany
ears ;thegeneral effect being toanEuropean earverymo-
notonous.

theywere recognised andapproved ofbycompetent judges;
andthattheNewZealander himself said, "heshould soon
