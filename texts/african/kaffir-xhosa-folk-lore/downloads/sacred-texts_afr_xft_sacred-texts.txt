Text [Zipped]
This is a collection of folk tales from the South African Xhosa people,
 the tribe to which Nelson Mandela belongs.
 Please note that the original title of the book uses an
 appellation for the Xhosa, Kaffir, which today is considered disrespectful.
 That said, this is a scholarly collection of Xhosa tales; it is a
 primary source on the subject. 
 As such, this book is part of the cultural heritage of South Africa and
 is both entertaining and informative.
