ILLUSTRATIONS

"How hold ye Lorne?" Rupert's softly spoken question brought the
well-remembered answer to Val's lips: "By the oak leaf, by the sea wave,
by the broadsword blade, thus hold we Lorne!"

"I'se Lucy," she stated, thoroughly at her ease. "An' dis is Letty-Lou"

Ricky lifted off the cover. Val stared at the canvas

"It's a genuine Audubon," Charity said

_Zzzzzrupp_! Satan was industriously ripping the remnants of lining from
its interior

The canoe floated almost of its own volition into a dead and distorted
strip of country

At the bayou at last, they wriggled Jeems awkwardly into the boat

Then came a tree burdened with a small 'coon which stared at the boy
piteously, its eyes green in the light

Ricky held aloft a great war sword. There could be no doubt in any of
them--the Luck of Lorne had returned


RALESTONE LUCK


    _How hold ye Lorne?_

    By the oak leaf,
    By the sea wave,
    By the broadsword blade,
    Thus hold we Lorne!

    _The oak leaf is dust,
    The sea wave is gone,
    The broadsword is rust,
    How now hold ye Lorne?_

    By our Luck, thus hold we Lorne!
