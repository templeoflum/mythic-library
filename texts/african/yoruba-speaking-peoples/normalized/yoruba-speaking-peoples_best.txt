OFTHE
SLAVE COAST OFWEST AFRICA.
CHAPTER 1.
Inteoductort.
The portion oftlieWest African coast occnpiecl by
tlieYoruba-speaking peoples issituated intheeastern
lialfoftlieSlave Coast, and liesbetween Badagry, on
thewest, and tlieBenin Eiver, ontlie east. Tlie
extent ofsea-board heldbytliem isthnssmaller than
that occupied either bytheTshi orbytheB\Ve
tribes;buttheYorubas arereally aninland people,
and itwasnotuntil thebeginning ofthepresent
century thattheymoved tothesouth andcolonised
Lagos andtheadjacent littoral.
The territory nowinhabited bytheYoruba tribes
isbounded onthewestbyDahomi, onthesouth-west
byPortoNovo andAppa, onthesouth bythesea,on
theeastbyBenin, andonthenorth bytheMoham-
medan tribes from the interior, who have within
recent times conquered andannexed theYoruba
province ofIlorin, andwhose territory maynowbe
saidtoextend southward toabout 8°30'N.latitude.

The aggressions oftliese Moliammedan tribes com-
menced very early intliepresent century, and itwas
nodoubt tliispressure from thenorth thatcaused the
Yorubas tomove tothesouth and colonise thesea-
board.
Yoruba country atpresent comprises thefollowing
states, orpolitical units:—
(1)TheBritish colony ofLagos, which covers the
whole sea-front between themeridian oftheAjarra
Creek andtheBenin Eiver, andhasabsorbed the
former native kingdoms ofAppa, Pokra, Badagry,
Lagos, Palma, Lekki, Mahin, Ogbo, andJakri.
(2)Ketu. This isthewestern state. Itisbounded
onthewestbyDahomi, onthesouth byPorto Novo,
andontheeastbyEgba. Itsnorthern limits are
undefined.
(3)Egba. Itlieseast ofKetu andsouth-west of
Yoruba proper. Itscapital isAbeokuta, "Under the
Rock."
(4)Jebu. This isthesouth-eastern kingdom, and
isdivided intotwoprovinces, called JebuRemo and
Jebu Ode. JebuOdehasfor itscapital atown of
thesame name, that ofJebuRemo iscalled Ofiin.
The riverOdoOmi isconsidered thenorth-western
boundary ofJebu, and,roughly speaking, theterritory
oftheJebusmaybesaid toextend inland toadistance
ofsome fiftymilesfrom thelagoon.
(5)Ekiti Tribes. These tribes, which form acon-
federation, lietothenorth-east ofJebu Ode.
(6)Ibadan. Itliesnorth ofJebu Ode.
(7)Yoruba proper. Thiskingdom, whose capital
isOyo, liestothenorth ofIbadan andEgba, and


INTRODUCTORY.3
towards thewest itsboundary trends southward to
within some twenty-five miles ofAbeokuta.
(8)Ijesa, capital Ilesa. This state issituated to
thesouth-east ofYoruba proper.
(9)Ife,capital ofthesame name, liessouth-west
ofIjesa.
(10) Ondo. Thiskingdom, capital Ondo, issitu-
atedsouth-east ofIfe.
Inaddition there areseveral small states, orrather
mdependent townships, consisting ofatown anda
fewoutlying villages. The principal areBgbado,
Okeodan, Ado, Awori, andIgbessa, allofwhich lie
south ofEgba. Their inhabitants areEgbados, or
Southern Egbas {IJgba-odo, Egbas ofthecoast).
Theinhabitants ofallthese states speak onelan-
guage, theYoruba. They arecalled ISTagos bythe
French, andbytheEnglish arenamed after their
political divisions, asEgbas, Ibadans, Jebus, &c.
Thelagoon system, which inthelastvolume ofthis
series wasnoted ascommencing ashort distance to
thewest oftheYolta River, ontheGold Coast,
extends along thewhole sea-front oftheterritory
occupied bytheYoruba-speaking tribes, andaffords
acontmuous waterway from Porto JN'ovo toBenin.Theextension ofthecontinent inasoutherly direction,
which wasmentioned inthelastvolume astypical of
thewestern half oftheSlave Coast, andwhich may
doubtless beattributed totheaction oftheGuinea
current inclosing with sand theopenings toformer
indentations which existed inthecoast-line, isalso
equally noticeable inthis theeastern half ofthe
Slave Coast; and,generally speaking, thecountry is

open, flat,anddevoid ofstones. Jebu isanexcep-
tion,being tliickly forested ;but itappears tliat less
territory liasbeenwonfrom theseasouth ofJebu,
andeast ofLagos generally, than inthedistricts to
thewest, between Lagos andDahomi. Totheeast
ofLagos theoldcoast-line seems tohavebeen almost
conterminous with thenorthern shores oftheKradu
andLekki lagoons, andthewater-way which connects
thembyway ofEpi,while tothewest itappears to
have trended back northwards beyond thelagoons
ofOluge andPorto Novo. Itisonly after crossing
thenarrow lagoon orcreek called theAjarra Creek,
which runs inaconvex curve from thePortoNovo
lagoon totheOkpara, that stones arefound inthe
soil;andabout twenty miles tothewest ofthisthere
appears tohave been atonetime agreat bay, the
northern limit ofwhich was theKo,orGreat Marsh,
ofDahomi, thirty-five miles from thepresent coast-
line.Thedotted lineintheaccompanying mapshows
theprobable position oftheancient coast-line between
theYolta River andlickki.
Northward oftheoldcoast-line theYoruba country
rises very gradually inasuccession oflow-lying
plateaus, traversed byafew lines oflow hills, or
undulations intheground ;butachain ofmountains,
whose general direction iseastandwest, extends, at
about eight degrees north latitude, fromDahomi to
thenorthern border ofIjesa, where thecountry is
rugged and difiicult. Isolated anddensely-wooded
hills,from 800 to1,200 feethigh, arealsofound in
IfeandOndo.

Abeokuta, isolated masses ofgranite afford evidence
ofgreat denudation. Infactthewhole western coast
ofAfrica, between theIslesdeLos,seventy miles north
ofSierra Leone, andLagos, andprobably beyond
those limits, shows traces ofanenormous denudation.
The table-topped Kofiu Mountain, which rises sheer
from theplain north oftheMelikuri Eiver toaheight
of2,000 feet, isthesoleremnant ofavast capof
sandstone that doubtless atonetime covered the
whole ofthatpartofthecountry; andtheKrobo Moun-
tain,anisolated andprecipitous mass, 800feethigh,
situated intheKrobo plain ontheGrold Coast, to-
gether with thetable-topped mountains with vertical
cliffs intheAtaklu district, tothenorth oftheQuittah
(Keta) lagoon, willprobably, when geologically exa-
mined, prove tobeother vestiges ofthesame sand-
stone formation.
Oftheearly history oftheYoruba-speaking peoples
nothing isknown, except what canbegleaned from
Dalzel's "History ofDahomey," 1793, fromwhich it
would appear that, atthebeginning oftheeighteenth
century, allthedifferent tribes were united, andwere
ruled byakingwho resided atOldOyo, sometimes
called Katunga. Thekingdom ofYoruba alsoseems
tohave beenmore powerful than theothertwogreat
African kingdoms, Dahomi andAshanti. Between
1724 and1725 theKing ofYoruba espoused the
quarrel oftheKing ofArdra, whose kingdom had
been overthrown byDahomi, andsentalarge army,
chiefly consisting ofcavalry, toinvade Dahomi. By
astratagem*'theYorubas were routed, andtheking

ofDaliomi tlien diplomaticallj sued forpeace, wliicli
wasgranted; butabout September, 1728, anew
quarrel having arisen, tliistime intlieinterests oftlie
King ofWliydali, aYoruba army again invaded
Daliomi, andadesultory war lasted until 1730,when
peace wasoncemore made. In1738 another Yoruba
army invaded Daliomi, defeated theking,andcaptured
andburnt Agbomi, Kana, andZassa ;*andfrom that
timeforward theYorubas annually raided intoDahomi,
ravaging thecountry, andretiring again atthecom-
mencement oftherains. This state ofaffairs was
brought toanendbyatreaty ofpeace made in1747,
bywhich theKing ofDahomi undertook topaya
heavy annual tribute totheKing ofYoruba. After
thiswehear nomore oftheYorubas inDalzel's
History, which isonly carried to1791, except that,
in1786, they interfered toprevent theDahomis from
attacking Porto JSTovo;butthetribute appears tohave
been paiduptothedays ofKing Gezo ofDahomi
(1818).
Governor Dalzel informs us,however, thatwhen
the"Byeos"t (Yorubas) were dissatisfied with a
king, they sent adeputation tohimwith apresent of
parrot's eggs, andamessage that they considered
hemust befatigued with thecares ofgovernment,
andthat itwastime forhim torestandtakealittle
sleep. Upon receiving thismessage, theking forth-
with retired tohisapartments, asiftosleep, and
thengave directions tohiswomen tostrangle him,

tTheYorubas were called Eycos orOyos byoldwriters, after the
name oftlicir capital, Oyo.

vvliicli they accordingly did.* In1774, tliethenking
declined totake tliehint,andreturned theparrot's
eggs. The chiefs tried tosu^Dport thecustom by
force, andOchemi, theprime minister headed arebel-
lion,which was, however, crushed, andOchemi, and
allhisnumerous family were puttodeath.
Thereason ofourhaving suchmeagre information
ofthisgreatWest African kingdom isthattheYorubas
didnotinhabit theterritories onthesea-coast, theEwe
tribes occupying thecoast line asfareast asBadagry,
andtheBenin tribes theportion from Badagry to
Benin. TheEwe tribes had infactspread along
thesea-shore from west toeast, and theBenin
tribes from east towest, tillthey met,andcovered
alltheseafrontage oftheinland territory occupied
bytheYorubas. This neglect onthepart ofthe
Yorubas topushdown totheseamayhavebeen partly
.duetosuperstition, forDalzel says that "thefetiche
oftheEyeos wasthesea,"andthattheyandtheir
kingwere threatened with death bytheir priests if
theyever dared tolookupon it.Slave traders and
others, whofrequented theSlave Coast during the
lastcentury, were thus notbrought intocontact with
theYorubas, andconsequently wehear but little of
them ;while theliterature concerning AsLanti and
Dahomi, which, hkeYoruba, were originally inland
powers, butwhose invasions ofthecoast kingdoms
brought them intocontact withEuropeans, isample.
Asfarascanbeascertained, thechief strength of
Yoruba layinitscavalry, which wassaid tonumber

itisyetaltogether extinct.

100,000, amanifest exaggeration, forhorses have
never beennumerous inthefew districts ofWest
Africa inwhich itispossible forthem tolive. The
report astothenumber ofcavalry reached thetraders
through thecoast tribe,whoowned nohorses, and
whowere nodoubt greatly impressed bythespec-
tacle ofafewscore ofmounted men. According to
tradition, thefollowing wasthemethod ofdetermin-
ingthenumber ofmenrequired foramilitary expedi-
tion.Anox-hide waspegged down infront ofthe
general's tent,andthehorsemen made torideover it
insuccession between two spears. When, bythis
process, aholehadbeenworn inthe hide, the
number ofmenwasthought sufficient foranordinary
campaign. Forserious operations twoox-hides were
used, oneplaced overtheother.
Although asweknow from Dalzel's History, Oyo,
orYoruba, wasapowerful kingdom atleast asearly
as1724, Yoruba traditional history carries usback
nofurther than theendoftheeighteenth century, a
factwhich shows what little reliance canbeplaced
upon thetraditions ofnations who areunacquainted
withtheartofwriting. The firstking ofwhom the
aroJdn, orchroniclers, haveanyknowledge isAjagbo,
whoappears tohave reigned soon after 1780, and
whose name ispreserved inthemetrical sentence
which fixes therhythm ofthe ogidigho drum, as
follows :Gbo,Ajagho, gboohagho, Idemi, Idosigbo.*
*"Grow old,AjagbOj grow oldking, grow old,may Ialsogrow

Intliedays ofAjagbo tliekingdom ofYoruba con-
sisted oftliefourfollowing states.
(1)Yoruba proper, wliose capital, OldOjo, or
Katunga, wassituated some ninety miles tothenortli
oftliepresent town ofOyo. Theking ofthis state,
whose titlewasAlafin, orAlaioofin, literally "Onewho
owns theentering ofthepalace," wastheruler over
alltheYoruba-speaking tribes.
(2)Egba, which laytothesouth andwest ofthe
above kingdom. ItschieftownwasAke,andfrom it
thechief took his title ofAlahe, "Onewhoowns
Ake."
(3)Ketu. Thiswas then, asnow, thewestern
province. Itscapital wasKetu, andfrom itthechief
took histitle ofAlakeiu, "Onewhoowns Ketu."
(4)Jebu, which laysouth and east ofYoruba
proper. Itwasdivided intoJebuEemu andJebu
Ode, each having itsown chief, buttheruler ofthe
latter, called theAwujale, wasconsidered thechief of
thewhole.
Therulers ofYoruba, Egba, andKetu styled each
other "brother."
Ajagbo wassucceeded byAbiodun, who issaid to
have enjoyed alongandpeaceful reign, sothatthe
reign ofhisbrother and successor, Arogangan, can
scarcely havecommenced before 1800. Itwasduring
thereign ofArogangan that theYoruba kingdom
commenced tobreak up.TheFulas, itseems, over-
rantheterritory oftheHans as,andthelatter, driven
southward, sought refuge inthenorthern provinces of
Yoruba. Arogangan had appointed hisnephew,
Afunja, governor ofIlorin, thenorth-eastern pro-


INTRODUCTOliY. 11
vince, wliicli contained alarge nnmber ofHausa
refugees, andAfunja, being ambitious, conceived the
project ofutilising tlieHausas inorder todethrone
hisuncle andmake himself Alafin. Hisplans being
matured, heraised aninsurrection, -which metwith a
measure ofsuccess, forOyowas besieged, and
Arogangan, inorder toavoid falling intothehands
ofhisnephew, poisoned himself ;butAfunja was
notable tosecure thethrone, astheelders ofOjo
elected tothemonarchy Adebo, thebrother of
Arogangan, andAfunja had toretire toIlorin,
where hemaintained asemi-independent position.
These events aresupposed tohave taken place about
1807, and itwasabout thesame time thatsome of
theYorubas firstpushed tothesonth andcolonised
Lagos. The first chief ofLagos wasnamed Ashipa,
and issaid tohave belonged tothefamily ofthe
Alafin.
Adebo only reigued about fourmonths, anddied
suddenly, from which itwassupposed thathewas
poisoned. Hewas succeeded byMaku, who en-
deavoured tomake head against theMohammedan
tribeswhowerenowpressing infrom thenorth, but
hewas defeated inagreat battle, andcommitted
suicide, aftsr areign ofabout onlythree months. An
interregnum nowensued, during which thereins of
power were heldbytheOba-slwrun, orprime minister,
and itwasnotuntil fiveyears hadelapsed thatanew
king,named Majotu, was elected. Hereigned about
seven oreight years, committed suicide onaccount,
tradition says, ofthemisbehaviour ofhisson,andwas
succeeded byAmodo.


12 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Afunja had, since 1807, remained inpossession of
llorin, where hehadsought tostrengthen himself by
encouraging Mohammedans tosettle, and,about 1825,
whileAmodo wasengaged with theinvading tribes
from thenorth, heagainmadewarupon Yoruba. He
captured anddestroyed anumber oftowns, andwas
apparently about tocarry allbefore him,when, for
some reason that hasnever transpired, hewascon-
veyed back tothetown ofllorin bythose veryHausa
mercenaries through whose aidhehadhoped tobe-
come Alafin, andpubhcly burned alive. TheMoham-
medan party had forsome years been dominant in
llorin, andnow, declaring that itwould nolonger
recognise apagan king, itelected aMohammedan to
thesupreme power, andsevered theconnection with
Yoruba.
llorin nowtook thelead intheMohammedan in-
vasion ofYoruba, andtheYorubas seem tohavebeen
invariably worsted. In1830,when itwasvisited by
Lander, OldOyowas stillthecapital ofYoruba, but
between 1833and1835 itwascaptured anddestroyed
bytheMohammedans, andtheYorubas, flying south-
wards, founded their present capital Oyo, about
ninety miles south oftheoldone.TheEgbas, taking
advantage oftheoverthrow ofYoruba, declared them-
selves independent, buttheYorubas, assoon asthey
were settled intheirnew territory, attacked them
with vigour, anddrove them outofalltheir northern
towns.Adesultory warthenlingered tillabout 1838,
when theEgbas abandoned their territory, andmoving
tothesouth, founded their present capital, Abeokuta.
Thenewtown was divided into several distinct


INTRODUCTORY. 13
quarters, ortownships, which werenamed after an
equalnumber oftowns thathadbeen destroyed inthe
war,andoneofthem, Ake, stillpreserves thename
oftheoldEg-ba capital. Although these events oc-
curred sorecently, theyhave already become clothed
withmyth ;andLishabe, thechiefwho ledthem to
Abeokuta, isbelieved bytheEgbas tohave been a
o-iantandademi-god.
About thesame time, Ibadan, atown oftheold
province ofEgba, situated some thirty-five miles
south ofOyo, declared itself independent ofEgba;
theoriginal Egba inhabitants having been driven out
bytheJebus, andthelatter, intheir turn,byYoruba
refugees. Other secessions took place, andby1840
theYoruba kingdom had splitupintothefollowing
independent states.
(1)Yoruba, south ofOldYoruba, capital Oyo.
(2)Egba, south andwest ofOldEgba, capital
Abeokuta.
(3)Ketu.
(4)Jebu.
(5)Ibadan, asmall state south ofOyo. Itowned
anominal allegiance tothe Alafin, because its
inhabitants were Yoruba refugees, butwas really
independent.
(6)Ijesa, asmall state south ofIlorin. Theruler
wasstyled theOwa.
(7) Ife,asmall state south-west ofIjesa. The
rulerwasstyled theOni.
Theformer Yoruba province ofIlorin wasnow
inhabited byFulas, Bornus, andHausas, andwassaid
tohave apopulation of300,000, 80,000 ofwhom


14 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
were inthetown ofIlorin. The Fulas were the
dominant race, and thegovernment was intlieir
liands.
Shortly after 1840 theEkiti tribes, asthejwere
afterwards termed, that is,theinhabitants ofthe
various towns lying between Ibadan andIjesa, and
theadjoining territory tothesouth, formed acon-
federation, which wassoon joined byIfeand Ijesa,
theruler ofthelatter state being elected head ofthe
confederation. TheMohammedans ofIlorin were
the first totakealarm atthis coalition, andattacked
theconfederates, destroying orannexing several
towns while Ibadan soon followed suit,and after a
time succeeded inconquering andannexing Ijesa.
The result ofthese various conflicts was thatthe
confederation was entirely subdued, onehalfpassing
under therule ofIlorin andtheother under that of
Ibadan. Before long, however, theinhabitants of
thetowns which hadbeen annexed toIlorin applied
toIbadan forassistance, andanother warensued,
which resulted intheexpulsion ofthe Ilorins, and
theestablishment oftheruleofIbadan over thewhole
Ekiti confederation. Thiswasabout 1858.
While these events weretaking place intheinterior,
Lagos, which, aswehave seen, wascolonised from
Yoruba atthebeginning ofthecentury, hadbecome
aplace ofsome note asaslave emporium. Thewars
inthenorth, which hadbeen almost incessant since
therebellion ofAfunja about 1807, hadresulted in
thecapture ofmany thousands ofprisoners ofwar,
ofboth sexes and allages, andthedregs ofthese,
themenwho Avere ofnolocal importance, andthe

women whowere nolonger attractive, were, in
accordance with,theusaal practice, sold totlieslave-
traders. Lagos wasthemost convenient port, and
•fheywere therefore marched down there ingangs to
await shipment. This traffic inslaves, which brought
Lagos intosome notoriety, commenced about the
year 1815, andsoon attained very large dimensions.
In1836 astruggle forthesuccession broke outin
Lagos, and resulted inKosoko, thelegitimate pre-
tender, being expelled thekingdom byhisrival
Oluwole, whosecured thethrone forhimself. Olu-
wole died in1841, andwassucceeded byAkitoye,
whowas foolish enough toinvite Kosoko, whowas
still alive and inbanishment, tocomeandlive in
Lagos. Kosoko readily accepted theinvitation, soon
began conspiring, andbefore longfound himself suf-
ficiently wellsupported torebel. Inthestruggle
which ensued thetown ofLagos wasburned, and
Akitoye driven intobanishment. Hefound arefuge
atBadagry, and, inorder toinduce theEnglish to
espouse hiscause, promised that, ifhewere re-instated
atLagos, hewould help tosuppress theslave-trade.
This negotiation coming totheknowledge ofKosoko,
hedespatched aforce toBadagry toattack Akitoye,
which burned thetown, killed anEnglish trader
named Glee,anddestroyed agreat deal ofproperty
belonging toBritish subjects. The senior naval
officer upon thestation thereupon determined tosup-
port Akitoye against Kosoko, andH.M. sloops

gunvessels Bloodhound andVolcano, assembled offthe

the sliips' boats, towed bytheBloodhound, entered
thelagoon andproceeded towards Lagos Island. As
theBritish Consul, whowaswith the flotilla, had
hopes thatKosoko would submit toadisplay of
force, flags oftruce werekept flying ;andalthough,
onrounding the first point, aheavy musketry fire
wasopened bythenatives, the firewasnotreturned,
andthe flagswere notlowered tilltheboats were
within amile ofthetown. Atthispoint several
guns opened ontheboats, sotheflags oftruce were
hauled down andthe firereturned. The firefrom
theboats had,however, but little effect onthenatives,
whowere well covered bystockades andmud walls,
and aparty ofonehundred and sixtymenwas
accordingly landed. They found themselves ina
maze ofnarrow streets, from every corner ofwhich
theywere fireduponbyconcealed enemies, and after
losing two officers killed andseveral menwounded,
theywere compelled toretreat totheboats.
This failure ledtoamore determined attack in
December, onthe26th ofwhich month aconsider-
able force, under thecommand ofCommodore H.
"W.Bruce, entered thelagoon inboats. Thenatives
offered astubborn resistance, andhad inposition
several guns, which were exceedingly well served.

necessary toland aparty andcarry thebattery by

andfour officers and fifty-eight menwounded. The

other vessels andboats had. intliemeantime kept
upavigorous bombardment, wliicli wasmaintained
allthat day,andcontinued nextmorning from day-
break until about 11a.m.,when amagazine onshore
blew upand set j&re tothetown. The flames,
fanned bythesea-breeze, spread with remarkable
rapidity, andtheheatwas sointense that the fire
ofthenatives gradually slackened andthen finally
stopped. Next morning, Kosoko and hisfollowers
having abandoned the place, the British landed.
They found thebeach strongly stockaded, andan
enfilading piece ofordnance atevery promontory.
Pifty-two guns were captured, butthevictory was
dearly purchased, asthetotal lossduring thetwo
days' operations amounted totwo officers and fifteen
men killed, four officers andsixty-eight menwounded,
many ofthem very severely.
Akitoye wasnow reinstated, andonJanuary 1st,
1852, signed atreaty, undertaking tosuppress the
export slave trade, and toexpel allEuropeans en-
gaged inthe traffic. About September ofthesame
yearsome Portuguese slave traders, whohadbeen
expelled under this treaty, returned toLagos, and,
with theassistance ofsome ofthe chiefs, secretly
renewed the traffic. Akitoye, being informed ofwhat
wasgoing on,strove tostop it,whereupon thePortu-
guese incited thechiefs torebel, and inAugust, 1853,
Kosoko returned from Epi,where hehadtaken
refuge, tohead themovement. The British naval
authorities again interfered infavour ofAkitoye; a
party ofseamen andmarines waslanded tosupport
him, andonthe13th ofAugust, after asharp

oncemore fledtotlieeast.
Akitoye died inSeptember, poisoned, itwas said,
bytheslave trade party, and liissonDocemo was,
tkrongli British influence, appointed hissuccessor.
Kosoko, whohadagain found anasylum with the
chief ofEpi,refused toaccept thisarrangement, and
continued toharass Docemo andtheLagos people
untilbyanagreement made inJanuary, 1854, he
was recognised asKing ofPalma andLekki, on
condition ofrenouncing allclaim tothesovereignty
ofLagos. InAugust, 1861, Docemo ceded Lagos
tothe British inconsideration ofapension of
£1,000 ayear, andLagos thusbecame aBritish
possession; but itisdoubtful ifthecession was
altogether voluntary onDocemo's part, forduring
the firstfewyears succeeding thesignature ofthe
treaty hemade several protests against it.
In1860 anewwarbroke out inthe interior.
Ijaye, animportant town ofYoruba, declared itself
independent ofthe Alafin, who called upon the
Ibadans toassist him inreducing ittoallegiance.
TheIbadans complied, whereupon theEgbas sided
with Ijaye ;butthese allies sustained asevere defeat
atthehands oftheYorubas andIbadans, losing, it
issaid, 40,000 inkilled and prisoners, and Ijaye
wasdestroyed onMarch I7th, 1862.
Uptothistime theEgbas hadbeen considered
theproteges oftheBritish, andgreat interest had
been taken inthewelfare ofAbeokuta, which was
regarded asthebulwai'k ofChristianity inWest

anumber ofEgba slaves, wlio liadbeen liberated
atSierra Leone from captured slave vessels, re-
turned toAbeokuta andasked tkat missionaries
miglit besent totliem.AProtestant mission was
establislied there in1848, andwhen anattack on
thetownwasthreatened byGezo, King ofDahomi,
in1850, Mr. Beecroft, theBritish Consul forthe
Bights, andCommander Forbes, E.N., were sent to
Agbomi toendeavour topersuade theking toabandon
hisdesign. Themission completely failed, andGrezo
attacked Abeokuta onMarch 3rd,1851, butwas re-
pulsed withsome loss.* The British occupation of
Lagos in1861 putanend tothefriendly feelings of
theBgbas, who resented theprotection granted by
thecolonial authorities tofugitive slaves fromAbeo-
kuta,andobjected tothestoppage oftheexport slave
trade, inwhich theyhadbeen largely engaged. They
seem alsotohavehadsome suspicion that their inde-
pendence wasthreatened, forwhen inMay, 1861, it
wasproposed tosendsome trained gunners ofthe
2nd"West India Regiment toAbeokuta toinstruct
thepeople intheuseofsome guns thathadbeen
presented bytheBritish Grovernment, andtolend aid
during another attack thatwasnowthreatened by
Dahomi, theEgbas made excuse after excuse, and
finally declined toreceive them. In1862 they fur-
therdisplayed their ill-will bymolesting andplunder-
ingseveral native traders from Lagos, and, asthey
refused reparation, theGrovernor ofLagos, in1863,
blockaded alltheroads leading toAbeokuta.
In1863, Kosoko, chief ofPalma andLekki, desired

toreturn toLagos, and, inorder toobtain per-
mission, ceded Palnia andLekki to tlie British.
The Possn, orchief o£Epi, raised objections to
this cession. Hehad, itappeared, certain terri-
torial rights over these places, and their cession,
moreover, shuthim offfrom thesea.Asherefused
tocede hisrights, anexpedition, consisting ofthree
officers and124men ofthe2ndand3rdWest India
Regiments, proceeded inH.M.S. Investigator toEpi,
where thetroops andarocket party ofone officer
andfourteen seamen landed. The natives offered a
strenuous resistance, andtheexpeditionary force suf-
fered aloss ofthreemen killed and three officers
andtwenty-eight menwounded, butthetown was
destroyed. After thisthechief renounced allfurther
claim toterritory south ofthelagoon. InJuly,
1863, thechiefs ofBadagry likewise ceded alltheir
territory totheBritish.
Thewarbetween theEgbas andIbadans caused
bytheaffair ofIjayehadbeen carried oninadesul-
torymanner since 1862; butin1864, after therepulse
oftheDahomis from before Abeokuta onMarch 15th,*
theJebus, whohadhitherto adopted thepolicy of
excluding allstrangers from their territory, andhad
lived incomplete isolation, shut offbytheir forests
from therest ofthetribes, joined theEgbas, andthe
warwasprosecuted withmore vigour. TheJebus
ofIkoradu, atown atthenorthern exti'emity ofthe
Lagos lagoon, refused tojoin their fellow-tribesmen
inthealliance with theEgbas, their reason being that
their interests were identified with those ofthepeople

ofLagos, and tliat tliey liad suffered equally with
tliem from tliecessation oftrade caused bythemal-
treatment oftraders bytheBgbas. Inrevenge^ the
Egbas, early in1865, despatched toIkoradu an
army of12,000 men,which besieged thetown, and,
after thenative fashion, threw uptwoentrenched
camps against it.TheColonial Grovernment, alarmed
atthenearapproach ofthis force, andappealed to
bytheIkoradus foraid,warned theEgbas todesist,
andordered them toreturn totheirown country.
TheEgbas sent insulting messages inreply, anda
force ofsome 280men, consisting ofthe5th"West
India B-egiment andtheLagos Police, was accord-
ingly sent against them, which stormed thecamps
androuted theEgbas withheavy loss,onMarch 29th,
1865. This affair ofcourse onlyserved towiden the
breach between theBritish andtheEgbas, thelatter,
besides, conceived that the Colonial Grovernment
encouraged theannual raids ofDahomi uponEgba
territory;and, in1867, they expelled allthemission-
aries fromAbeokuta, and cut offallrelations with
theBritish.
Itseems that aletter, purporting tobesigned bya
hostile chief, fellintothehands oftheEgbas, who
knew thatthechief could notwrite, andfancied they
recognised thehandwriting asthat ofaProtestant
missionary whohadformerly lived inAbeokuta. The
missionaries inAbeokuta were thereupon accused of
betraying theEgbas totheir enemies ;there wasa
popular tumult, andthemobhowled fortheir blood.
Itwasonlywith great difficulty thatthechiefs and

whowore immediately expelled from tlietown, and
their houses andchurches destroyed. In1880, the
French Roman Catholic missionaries obtained leave to
establish amission inAbeokuta, which thenceforward
fellmore under theinfluence oftheFrench.
The interior continued tobedisturbed byinter-
tribal wars until about 1870, when affairs calmed
down, butin1877 theBgbas plundered some Ibadan
traders, andtheIbadans sentanarmy toavenge the
outrage. Upon thistheJebus renewed their former
alhance with theBgbas, and Ijesa andtheEkiti
tribes, which hadnowbeen under therule ofIbadan
since 1858, seized theopportunity forrebellion, astep
which wassoon followed byadeclaration ofwar
against Ibadan byUorin. TheMohammedans of
Ilorin rapidly invaded thecountry and laid siege to
Ofa, atown situated some twenty miles tothenorth-
east ofthe city ofIbadan, andtheIbadans were
obliged towithdraw theirarmy ofinvasion fromBgba
inorder todefend theirown territory, which wasnow
threatened from three sides. TheBgbas, however,
didnotfollow uptheretreating force, and, indeed,
took nofurther part inthewar,theybeing held in
check bythefear ofleaving Abeokuta unprotected
against Dahomi, which power hadbeen inthehabit
ofmaking annual demonstrations initsvicinity for
some years past; andthestruggle wascontinued
between Ibadan, ontheoneside,andIlorin, Ijesa, the
Bkiti tribes, andJebu, ontheother.
Ibadan secured thesupport ofModakeke and Ife,
twopopulous towns situated onhillsontheopposite
sides ofasmall stream, tothesouth-west ofIjesa, and


INTRODUCTORY, 23
tliewarcontinued forsome years without anygreat
advantage being gained byeither side. TheModa-
kekes were staunch alHes oftheIbadans, butthe
sympathies oftheIfeswere rather with theIjesaand
theEkiti tribes, withwhom theyhadbeen inaUiance
durino- thewarwhich terminated in1858. Their
situation, however, madethem afraid ofcoming toan
open rupture with Ibadan, so,inresponse tothe
demand oftheIbadans, they sent acontingent to
theIbadan camp, but atthesame time also secretly
sentanequal force tothecamp oftheIjesas and
Ekitis. This double game could notlong escape
detection, and in1882 theModakekes, assisted bya
force ofIbadans, attacked Ife,andthetown, which
wasregarded asholy,andthecradle oftheYoruba
race,wasdestroyed. The Ifesnowopenly joined the
enemies ofIbadan, butmost ofthetribes hadbythis
timebecome heartily sick oftheprolonged struggle,
andin1883 abody ofJebuswhowereencamped on
theOmiRiver made peace with theIbadans ontheir
own account, andreturned home. TheAwujale of
JebuOde,paramount chief ofthetwoJebu provinces,
wassoalarmed atthisevent thathefledfrom the
town ofJebu Ode,which hewasbylawforbidden to
leave, andtook refuge atEpi. Here hewas invited
bytheJebu elders tocommit suicide ;heproved
docile, andanewAwujale was elected bythepeace
party. His election, however, wasnotapproved by
thewarparty, andastrong force ofJebus, under the
seriJci, orsecond war chief, stillkept the field against
Ibadan.
Thewar,which was really only asuccession of

skirmis]ies atlong intervals, dragged on till1884,
when tlieGrovernor ofLagos wasasked tomediate
andsecure apeace. In1886 thisrequest wasrenewed
byallthecombatants except Ilorin, andtheG-overnor
accordingly acted asmediator, with theresult that
representatives from thedifferent tribes assembled at
Lagos, andonJune 4thanagreement was signed, of
which thefollowing were thechief points :
(1)Ibadan, Ijesa, andtheEkiti tribes torespec-
tively retain their independence.
(2)Thefour Ekiti towns ofOtan, Iresi, Ada,and
Igbajo tobeceded toIbadan, ontheunderstanding
that thepresent inhabitants were atliberty toleave
them.
(3)Thetown ofModakeke tobereconstructed on
territory between theOshun andOba rivers, tothe
north ofitsthen situation ;such oftheinhabitants as
elected topassunder therule ofIbadan moving to
thenew site,and those who preferred tobecome
subject toIfeliving inIfeterritory, butnot in
Modakeke, which wastobedealt withbytheIfes as
theythought fit.
Thebelligerents were atthistime established insix
large camps, thechief being those atKijiandOke
Mesi, situated about amileapart upon opposite sides
ofamountainous valley inthenorth ofIjesa, the
former occupied bytheIbadans andthelatter bythe
Ijesas andEkiti tribes. TheIbadans hadanother
camp atIkirun, about fifteen miles west ofIviji,
between thetwoarms oftheErinle River, where they
confronted theIlorins, whowereencamped atOfa,
eighteen miles tothenorth. TheModakekes, with


INTRODUCTORY. 25
anIbadan contingent, were atMoclakeke watching
theIfes,who,with theJebu force under the Serild,
were encamped about two miles tothesouth. In
accordance with theterms oftheagreement, Com-
missioners were sent totheinterior bytheGrovem-
ment ofLagos totake steps tobreak upthecamps.
These proved tobetowns rather than camps, since
they consisted oftheordinary mud-walled houses of
thenatives, were defended byloop-holed mud walls,
andcontained many thousands ofwomen andchildren.
TheIbadan camp atKiji,which hadbeen inexistence
forseven years, was estimated tocontain between
50,000 and60,000 inhabitants, atleast two-thirds of
whom were non-combatants, andtheOkeMesicamp
40,000. These twocamps were evacuated andburned
onSeptember 28th, 1886, their occupants returning to
theirformer homes ;butanunexpected obstacle was
now offered bytheModakekes, who firstasked fora
delay, andthen positively refused tocarry outthe
agreement and quit their town, alleging that they
could notleave thespotwhere their forefathers were
buried. The factwasthey feared that ifthey
remained onthe soil ofIfe,theIfeswould revenge
themselves uponthem forthedestruction oftheholy
city,andthat iftheymoved toIbadan territory the
Ibadans would enslave them ;and after some further
delay, theCommissioners, finding there wasnopro-
spect oftheModakekes keeping their promise, returned
toLagos. The Ilorins hadnotbeen parties tothe
agreement ofJune 4th, but theCommissioners
endeavoured toarrange apeace between them and
theIbadans, and induce them toabandon their

camps atOfaandIkirim;this, however, didnot
succeed, andthewarbetween these two tribes con-
tinued.
Inthemeantime, while theinterior hadbeen dis-
turbed bjthese protracted native wars, thecolony of
Lagos had received further extensions, Ketonu, a
district ontheeastern shores ofLakeDenham Waters,
having attherequest ofthe natives, who feared
Trench aggression, been declared British inJanuary,
1880 ;while Appa, which liesbetween Ketonu and
Badagry, wasplaced within theBritish jurisdiction in
1883. ByLetters Patent, dated 13thJanuary, 1886,
Lagos wasmade asej)arate colony, independent ofthe
government oftheGrold Coast.
In1888, inconsequence ofthereported intrigues
oftheFrench inAbeokuta, whowere said tohave
offered totolerate slavery, and topayanannual sub-
sidy, iftheEgbas would place themselves under French
protection, efforts weremade tohave thelimits of
British andFrench territory andspheres ofinfluence
defined, with theresult that articles ofarrangement
forthedelimitation oftheEnglish andFrench posses-
sions ontheWest Coast ofAfrica were signed at
Paris, onAugust 10th, 1889. The fourth article
defined theterritories and spheres ofinfluence on
theSlave Coast, the line ofdemarcation being the
meridian which intersects the territory ofPorto
Novo attheAjarra Creek, andextending from the
sea totheninth degree ofnorth latitude. By
thisarrangement theeastern half ofAppa, with
itscapital, andPokra, became British, while the
western half ofAppa, together withKetonu, became

Frencli. Egba andOkeodan fell-within tlieBritish
sphere ofinfluence, andKetn within that ofthe
French.
Thewarbetween Ibadan and Ilorin stilllingered
on,and, in1889, Mr.Millson, theAssistant Colonial
Secretary, was sent totheinterior toendeavour to
arrange ameeting between theGrovernor ofLagos and
thebelligerents inorder tobring these hostilities
toanend, but, asthe chiefs declined toenter into
anynegotiations with theCommissioner, themission
failed.
Although Abeokuta hadnowbeen definitely placed
within theBritish sphere ofinfluence therewasno
improvement intherelations between theEgbas and
theLagos government. InJanuary, 1891, agreat
political meeting washeld atAbeokuta, atwhich the
oldcharge thatthegovernment connived atorencou-
raged theannual inroads ofDahomi wasrevived, and
some European missionaries were expelled. ACom-
missioner from thegovernment wassent toAbeokuta
inAugust, butachieved noresults, and inJanuary,
1892, theEgbas declared alltheir trade routes, both
tothecoast andtotheinterior, closed, andceased all
commercial relations with thecolony. Afurther
attempt onthepart ofthegovernment toopen nego-
tiations wasmade inthefollowing month, butcom-
pletely failed, and atameeting ofEgba chiefs, held
onthe13th ofApril, theproposal toreopen thetrade
routes toLagos wasunanimously negatived.
While affairs hadbeen inthisunsatisfactory state

ence, adispute with theJebus hadsprung upinthe

east. TlieBjinrin market, situated about tenmiles
east ofBpi,wasclosed bytheAwujale ofJebuOde
onaccount ofsome disagreement with thepeople of
Lagos ;andthough, inOctober, 1890, inconsequence
ofrepresentations madebythegovernment ofLagos,
itwasformally opened bytheGrovernor andrepresen-
tatives sentbytheAwujale, theJebusmade thiscon-
cession unwillingly, andhadnointention whatever of
departing from their policy ofexcluding foreigners
from the interior oftheir country. Consequently,
when, inMay, 1891, theActing Governor, Captain
Denton, O.M.Gr., leftLagos withanescort ofHausas
toproceed onamission toJebu Ode,with theobject
ofcoming tosome agreement fortheopening ofthe
country- tocommerce, theJebus refused toallow the
party toenter their territory, ontheplea thatthey
feared hostile action. TheAwujale notonlyrefused
totreat, butrejected thepresents offered onbehalf
oftheBritish Grovernment, fearing, nodoubt, that
toaccept them would entail some concession onhis
part.
Upon this affair being referred totheHome Grovern-
ment, theGrovernor wasinstructed todemand an
apology from theJebus fortheso-called insult offered
totheActing Grovernor, andtoinsistupon afreeright
ofwaythrough Jebu country. TheAwujale wasto
beinformed that, ifthese terms were notcomplied
with, forcewould beused. LiDecember, 1891, this
ultimatum wasconveyed totheAwujale byanofficer
oftheLagos Constabulary, andtheAwujale then
consented tosend toLagos representatives fully
empowered tomake theapology andsign atreaty.


INTRODUCTOJtY, 29
InJanuary, 1892, tlierepresentatives arrived, and
onthe21stmade aformal apology, andsigned an
agreement tomaintain afreeandunrestricted right-
of-way forpersons andgoods tlirougli Jebu territory;
tlieGovernment oftlieColony undertaking topay
tlieJebns anannual sum of£500 incompensation
fortheduties theyhadbeenaccustomed tolevyon
goods.
Forashort time theJebus observed their treaty
engagements, and onemember oftheChurch
Missionary Society was allowed topass through
JebuOdeonhisway totheinterior; butwhen,
soon afterwards, inthemonth ofFebruary, another
missionary attempted topassthrough thecapital he
was ill-used and sent back. Aparty ofIbadan
carriers, whosought topassthrough from thenorth,
was alsoturned back. TheAwujale asserted that
theIbadans hadbeen insolent, but itwasevident
that theyoung men ofthetribewere determined to
maintain theoldJebu policy ofisolation. The
Jebus were aturbulent andproud nation, andthey
considered itdisgraceful toobserve engagements
which hadbeen extorted fromthem bythreats. In
consequence ofthese breaches ofthe treaty, the
Inspector-aeneral oftheLagos Constabulary was
sent totheAwujale toaskforexplanations. He
landed atItoike, butwasnotallowed toproceed
anyfurther, theAwujale sending tosaythathedid
notwish"topalaver"with theLagos aovernment.
TheHome Grovernment now authorised theem-
ployment offorce. Special-service officers were sent
outfrom England, two officers and155men ofthe


so THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Gold Coast Constabulary were ordered from Accra,
and tliree officers and ninety-nine men oftlie 1st
Battalion West India Eegiment were despatched from
Sierra Leone. These, with 165 oftheLagos Con-
stabulary, andanIbadan Contingent of100men,
making atotal combatant force ofabout 500, left
Lagos, under thecommand ofColonel T.C.Scott,
C.B., onthe12th ofMay,anddisembarked atBpi
without opposition onthedayfollowing. Onthe
16th thecolumn advanced from Epi ;there wasa
slight skirmish atPobo onthesame day,another at
Kpashida next day,andonthe18th the force
encamped atMajoda.
Next morning theJebus were found inposition,
ready todefend thepassage oftheOshun Eiver, and
anaction commenced at7a.m. The fire ofthe
Jebus notonly swept the ford, which theyhad
deepened bydigging outthebed ofthestream, but
also thenarrow bush-track which led to it,and
wasexceedingly heavy andwell sustained. Itwas
reported thattheyhadoffered ahuman sacrifice tothe
goddess oftheriver, toenlist heraidagainst the
invaders, and thishadsopowerful aneffectupon the
superstitious minds oftheconstabulary, that forafull
hour theycould notbeinduced toenter thestream;
and itwasnotuntil theWest Indians, whohadbeen
held inreserve, were ordered uptolead theway
across theOshun, that theenemy's position was
carried. Between theriver andthevillage ofMas'-
bon,which thevictors entered shortly after 10a.m.,
wasfound thecamp which theJebus hadoccupied
theprevious night, Itwasestimated tohaveaccom-


INTRODUCTORY. 31
modated from 5,000 to6,000 persons, and asabout
lialf theoccupants ofanative camp arewomen and
non-combatants, thepassage oftheriver was pro-
bably disputed byabout 3,000 men. TheJebu losses
were supposed tobesevere, buttheBritish force lost
only three killed andtwenty-four wounded, exclusive
ofcarriers.
Onthe20th ofMay theadvance wasresumed soon
after daybreak, and,being metbyaflagoftruce, the
force occupied thetown ofJebuOde thesame day
without resistance. Itwasabout four miles incir-
cumference, defended byamud wall,andcontained
intime ofpeace about 15,000 inhabitants, allof
whom, with theexception oftheAwujale and his
immediate following, hadnow fled.Onthe25th,
theGrovernor arrived from Lagos toconduct the
negotiations with theAwujale, whomade complete
submission, alleging that theyoung menhadfought
contrary tohiswishes andorders;and,onthe30th
and31st, theexpeditionary force, with theexception
ofthree officers and140men oftheConstabulary, who
remained inoccupation ofJebu Ode, left forLagos,
onecolumn marching through Sagamu andIkoradu,
andanother through Itoike.
The trade routes ontheeastwerenow opened,
butthose through Egba country stillremained closed,
and forsome time itwasthought that amilitary
expedition against Abeokuta would benecessary.
Theeasewithwhich theJebus, whowere considered
averypowerful tribe, hadbeen punished, had,how-
ever,made aprofound impression upon thenative
mind, andmany British subjects ofEgba descent at

Lagos, fearing that, iftlie oliiefs ofAbeokuta main-
tained tlieir unfriendlj attitude, tlieindependence of
Egba would belost, strongly impressed upon tlieir
compatriots tlienecessity ofcoming toterms. In
consequence, theEgbas declared their willingness to
receive theGrovernor, Mr. Carter, andcome tosome
arrangement, with theresult that onthe18th of
January, 1893, atreaty was signed atAbeokuta.
TheEgbas undertook torefer alldisputes between
themselves andBritish subjects totheGrOvernor for
settlement, toestablish complete freedom oftrade
between Egba country andLagos, and toclose no
trade route without theconsent oftheGrOvernor.
They alsopromised toabolish human sacrifice, and
nottocedeanyportion ofEgba territory toaforeign
power without theconsent oftheBritish. Onthe
other hand. Great Britain guaranteed that theinde-
pendence ofEgba should befully recognised, andno
annexation ofanyportion ofitbemade without the
consent oftheEgba authorities.
There isaconsiderable difference between the
Yoruba-speaking Peoples and theEwe-speaking
Peoples. We stillfindthecharacteristics which were
dominant among thelatter, namely, indolence, impro-
vidence, and duplicity, butthey arenolonger so
pronounced, probably, almost certainly, because life
andproperty aremore secure. TheYoruba hasmore
independence ofcharacter than theTshis, G-as, or
Ewes, andservility israre.Heeven hasthesenti-
ments ofnationality andpatriotism, andthough these
areregarded with disfavour bytheColonial Grovern-

He isakeener trader, ismore sociable, and isinall
respects socially liiglier than thetribes oftheother
three cognate groups. This isinagreat measure
due tothephysical characteristics ofthecountry.
There being but little forest, except intheeastern
districts, commimication iseasy, and theterritory
ismoreover opened upbyseveral rivers. Instead,
then, ofbeing dispersed inanumber ofinconsiderable
hamlets, which aremere specks inavastandimpene-
trable forest, theYorubas have been able tolivein
towns, each ofwhich iswithin easycommunication
ofothers. Nodoubt their superior social instincts
firstcaused them tocongregate intowns, andnow
many generations oftown lifehasfurther developed
them. There iseven acertain amount ofloyalty in
theYoruba, aquality forwhich onemight look in
vainamong theEwe tribes. Without saying that
theYorubas aremore intelligent, wecansafely say
that their intellect ismore cultivated ;theasperities
ofsavage lifearesoftened, thesharper angles are
worndown byfrequent intercourse with their fellow-
men,andatthepresent daythey arecertainly the
leading people inWest Africa.

Chief Gods.
Thetendency wliicli wenoted inthecase oftheEwe-
speaking peoples toreplace godswhich were purely
local, andonlyworshipped bythose dwelling inthe
vicinity, bytribal gods, andbygodsworshipped byan
entire people, hasinthecase oftheYoruba tribes
beenvery fully developed, and allthegods possessing
anyimportance areknown toandworshipped bythe
Yoruba-speaking peoples asawhole. The effect of
increasing thenumber ofgeneral objects ofworship
hasbeen todiminish theimportance ofthelocal
objects ofworship, thegenii loci,who, except inJebu
andinsome oftheremoter districts, have been so
shorn oftheir power asnow tobescarcely above
thelevel ofthe fairies andwater- sprites ofmedieval
England, or,which isperhaps acloser parallel, ofthe
Naiads andHama-dryads ofancient Grreece. This
ofcourse iswhatwas tobeexpected, forthegeneral
objects ofworship govern, between them, allthe
phenomena which most nearly affect mankind; and
thespecial function ofeach genius loci isthusnow
vested insome other god,who isbelieved tobemore
powerful, because he isworshipped over alarger
areaandhasamore numerous following. Grods,

however, which arepurely tutelar have notbeen so
much affected, andtutelary dieties oftowns and of
individuals are stillcommon; because the native,
while enrolling himself asafollower ofageneral god,
likes also tohave aprotector whose solebusiness isto
guard hisinterests ;andwho,though hispowermay
belimited, isnotlikely tobedistracted bytheclaims
ofothers tohisattention.
Theterm usedbytheYoruba tribes toexpress a
superhuman being, orgod, isorisha, and as itis
used equally toexpress theimages andsacred objects,
and also asanadjective with themeaning ofsacred
orholy, itanswers exactly totheTshiterm holisum, the
Galoong, andtheEwe vodu. Theword orisha seems
tobecompounded ofori(summit, top,head) andsha
(toselect, choose);though some natives prefer to
derive itfrom ri(tosee)and islia (selection, choice),
andthus tomake itmean "Onewho seesthecult."
(1)Oloeun.
Olorun isthesky-god oftheYorubas, that is,heis
thedeified firmament, orpersonal sky,just asNyan-
kupon istotheTshis,Nyonmo totheGas,andMaAvu
totheEwes. Aswasmentioned inthelastvolume,
thegeneral bias ofthenegro mind hasbeen infavour
ofselecting thefirmament forthe chief Nature-
god,instead oftheSun,Moon, orEarth ;andinthis
respect the natives resemble theAryan Hindus,
Greeks, andRomans, withwhom Dyaus pitar, Zeus,
and Jupiter equally represented thefirmament.*

LikeNyankupon, Nyonmo, andMawu, Olorun is
considered toodistant, ortooindifferent, tointerfere
intheaffairs oftheworld. The natives saythathe
enjoys alife ofcomplete idleness and repose, a
blissful condition according totheir ideas, andpasses
histimedozing orsleeping. Since heistoolazy or
tooindifferent toexercise anycontrol over earthly
affairs, man onhis side does notwaste timem

"Have yourisen well ?"is0yinOlorim, "Thanks
toOlorun ;"andthephrase "May Olorun protect
you"issometimes heard asanevening salutation.
Theformer seems tomean thatthanks areduetothe
skyforletting thesunenter it ;andthelatter tobe
aninvocation ofthefirmament, theroof oftheworld,
toremain above andprotect theearth during the
night. Sometimes natives willraise their hands and
cry,"Olorun, Olorun !"just aswesay,"Heaven
forbid! "andwithanequal absence ofliteral meaning.
Olorun hasthefollowing epithets:—
(1)Oga-ogo {Oga, distinguished orbrave person;
ogo,wonder, praise).
(2)Oloivo (ni-oivo) "Venerable one."
(3)Electa {da, tocease from raining), "Hewho
controls therain."
(4)Elemi, "aliving man," literally "hewho
possesses breath." Itisatitle apj^lied toaservant
orslave, because hismaster's breath isathismercy;
and itisinthissense alsothat itisused toOlorun,
because, ifhewere evilly disposed, hecould letfall
thesolidfirmament andcrush theworld.
(5)Olodumaye orOlodumare. The derivation of


38 THEYOllUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
this epithet isobscure, but itprobably means
"Replenisher ofbrooks" {Olodo, possessing brooks).
We find thesame termination inOshumaye or
Oshumare, Eainbow, and inOsamaye orOsamare,
Water Lily, and itisperhaps compomided ofomi,
water, and aye,astate ofbeing alive.
Itmaybementioned that, just asthemissionaries
haye caused Nyankupon, Nyonmo, andMawu tobe
confused with theJehovah ofthe Christians, by
translating thesenames as"God," sohavethey done
with Olorun, whom they consider tobeasurvival
from aprimitive revelation, made toallmankind, in
thechildhood oftheworld. ButOlorun ismerely a
nature-god, thepersonally divine sky,andheonly
controls phenomena connected inthenative mind with
theroof oftheworld. He isnotinanysense an
omnipotent being. This iswell exemplified bythe
proverb which says,"Aman cannot causeram to
fall,andOlorun cannot giveyouachild," which
means that, justasamancannot perform thefunctions
ofOlorun andcause rain tofall, soOlorun cannot
form achild inthewomb, thatbeing thefunction of
thegodObatala, whom weshall next describe. In
fact,each god,Olorun included, has, asitwere, his
own duties ;andwhile heisperfectly independent in
hisowndomain, hecannot trespass upon therights of
others.
(2)Obatala.
Obatala isthechiefgodoftheYorubas. Thename
means"Lord oftheWhite Cloth"{Oha-ti-ala),and
isexplained bythefactthatwhite isthecolour sacred


CHIEF GODS. 39
toObatala, whose temples, images, andparapliernalia
arealways painted wliite, andwhose followers wear
white cloths. Another derivation isOha-ti-ala, "Lord
ofVisions, "and this gains some probability from
the fact that Obatala has theepithets ofOrisha
ofenia,"TheOrisha who enters man," andAlahalese
{Al-ha-ni-ase) "Hewho predicts the fntnre,"
beca.use heinspires theoracles andpriests, andunveils
futurity bymeans ofvisions. "Lord oftheWhite
Cloth," however, isthetranslation most commonly
adopted, andappears tobethecorrect one. Thegod
isalways represented aswearing awhite cloth.
Obatala, saythe priests, wasmadebyOlorun, who
then handed over tohim themanagement ofthe
firmament andtheworld, andhimself retired torest.
Obatala isthus also asky-god, but isamore anthro-
pomorphic conception than Olorun, andperforms
functions which arenotintheleast connected with
thefirmament. According toamyth, which is,how-
ever, contradicted byanother, Obatala made thefirst
manandwoman outofclay,onwhich account hehas
thetitle ofAlamorere, "Owner ofthebestclay;"and
because hekneaded theclay himself he iscalled
Orisha JqjoJcpo, "TheOrisha whokneads clay"{hpo,
totnead ortemper clay). Though this point is
disputed bysome natives, allareagreed thatObatala
forms the child inthemother's womb, andwomen
who desire tobecome mothers address their prayers
tohim ;while albinoism andcongenital deformities
areregarded ashishandiwork, done either topunish

some neglect towards liimontliepart oftlieparents,
ortoremind hisworshippers ofhispower.
Obatala isalso styled "Protector oftheTown
G-ates," andinthiscapacity isrepresented asmounted
onahorse, andarmed with aspear. Onthepanels
ofthetemple doors rude carvings arefrequently seen
ofahorseman with aspear, surrounded byaleopard,
tortoise, fish,andserpent. Another epithet ofObatala
isOhatala gbinghinihi,"Theenormous Obatala." His
special offerings areedible snails.
Amongst theEwe-speaking Peoples atPorto Novo,
Obatala determines theguilt orinnocence ofaccused
persons bymeans ofanoracle termed Onshe or
Onislie (messenger, ambassador). Itconsists ofa
hollow cylinder ofwood, about 3^feetinlength and
2feet indiameter, oneendofwhich iscovered with
draperies and theother closed with shells ofthe
edible snail. This cylinder isplaced onthehead of
theaccused, who kneels ontheground, holding it
firmly onhishead with ahand ateach side. The
god, being then invoked bythe priests, causes the
cylinder torockbackwards andforwards, andfinally
tofalltotheground. Ifitshould fallforward the
accused isinnocent, ifbackward guilty. The priests
saythat Obatala, orasubordinate spirit towhom
hedeputes theduty, strikes theaccused, soasto
make thecylinder fallintherequired direction ;but
sceptics and native Christians saythat achild is
concealed inthecylinder andoverbalances itinfront
orbehind, according toinstructions given before-
hand bythe priests. They addthatwhen achild
hasserved forayear ortwoandgrown toobigfor


CHIEF GODS. 41
tliecylinder lie isput todeath, inorder tliat the
secretmaybopreserved; and issucceeded byanother,
who, inhisturn, undergoes thesame fate—but all
this ismere conjecture.
(3)Odudua.
Odudua, orOdua, whohasthe title ofTyaagbe,
"Themother who receives," isthechief goddess of
theYorubas. Thename means "Black One" (clu,
tobeblack;dudu, black), andthenegroes consider
asmooth, glossy, black skin agreat beauty, andfar
superior tooneoftheordinary cigar-colour. She is
always represented asawoman sitting down, and
nursing achild.
Odudua isthewife ofObatala, butshewascoeval
with Olorun, andnotmade byhim, aswasherhus-
band. Other natives, however, saythat shecame
from Ife,theholy city, incommon withmost ofthe
other gods, asdescribed inamyth which weshall
come toshortly. Odudua represents theearth, mar-
ried totheanthropomorphic sky-god. Obatala and
Odudua, orHeaven andEarth, resemble, saythe
priests, two large cut-calabashes, which, when once
shut, cannever beopened. This issymbolised in
thetemples bytwowhitened saucer-shaped calabashes,
placed onecovering theother ;theupper oneofwhich
represents theconcave firmament stretching overand
meeting theearth, thelower one, atthehorizon.
According tosome priests, Obatala andOdudua
represent oneandrogynous divinity; andtheysaythat
animage which issufficiently common, ofahuman

being witlionearmand leg,andatailterminating in
aspliere, symbolises tliis. This notion, however, is
notonecommonly lield, Obutala andOdudua being
generally, andalmost universally, regarded astwo
distinct persons. The phallus andyoni injuxta-
position areoften seen carved onthedoors ofthe
temples both ofObatala andOdudua ;butthis does
notseem tohave anyreference toandrogyny, since
they arealsofound similarly depicted inother places
which areinnowayconnected with either ofthese
deities.
According toamyth Odudua isblind. Inthe
beginning oftheworld sheandherhusband Obatala
were shutupindarkness inalarge, closed calabash,
Obatala being intheupper partandOdudua inthe
lower. Themyth doesnotstatehowtheycame tobe
inthis situation, buttheyremained there formany
days, cramped, hungry, anduncomfortable. Then
Odudua began complaining, blaming herhusband for
theconfinement ;andaviolent quarrel ensued, inthe
course ofwhich, inafrenzy ofrage, Obatala toreout
her eyes, because shewould notbridle hertongue.
Inreturn shecursed him,saying "Naught shalt thou
eatbut snails," which isthereason why snails are
now offered toObatala. Asthemyth doesnotmake
Odudua recover her sight, shemust besupposed to
haveremained sightless, butnonative regards heras
being blind.
Odudua ispatroness oflove,andmany stories are
told ofheradventures andamours. Her chief temple
isinAdo, theprincipal town ofthestate ofthesame
name, situated about fifteen miles tothenorth of


CHIEF cons. 43
BadagTj. Theword Adomeans alewd person of
eitlier sex,and itsselection forthename ofthistown
isaccounted forbythefollowing legend. Odiidua
wasoncewalking alone intheforest when shemeta
hunter, whowassohandsome thattheardent tempera-
ment ofthegoddess atoncetook fire. Theadvances
which shemade tohimwere favourably received, and
theyforthwith mutually gratified their passion onthe
spot. After this, thegoddess became stillmore
enamoured, and,unable totearherself away from her
lover, shelived withhim forsomeweeks inahut,
which they constructed ofbranches atthefoot ofa
large silk-cotton tree. Attheend ofthistime her
passion hadburnt out,andhaving become weary of
thehunter, she lefthim ;butbefore doing soshe
promised toprotect him and allothers who
might comeanddwell inthefavoured spotwhere she
hadpassed somany pleasant hours. Inconsequence
many people came and settled there, andatown
gradually grew up,which wasnamed Ado, tocom-
memorate thecircumstances ofitsorigin. Atemple
was built fortheprotecting goddess )and there, on
herfeast days, sacrifices ofcattle andsheep aremade,
andwomen abandon themselves indiscriminately to
themaleworshippers inherhonour.
(4)Aganju andYemaja.
Before heramour with thehunter, Odudua bore to
herhusband, Obatala, aboyandagirl,named respect-
ivelyAganju andYemaja. ThenameAganju means
uninhabited tract ofcountry, wilderness, plain, or


44 THEYOnUBA-SPEAKTKG rEOPLE^.
forest, andYemaja, "Mother offish" {ijeye, mother;
eja, fish). Theoffspring oftheunion ofHeaven and
Earth, that is,ofObatala andOdudua, maythusbe
said torepresent Land andWater. Yemaja isthe
goddess ofbrooks and streams, and presides over
ordeals bywater. She isrepresented byafemale
figure, yellow incolour, wearing blue beads anda
white cloth. Theworship ofAganju seems tohave
fallen into disuse, ortohavebecome merged inthat
ofhismother ;butthere issaid tobeanopen space
infront oftheking's residence inOyowhere thegod
wasformerly worshipped, which isstill called 0]u-
Aganju—"Front ofAganju."
Yemaja married herbrother Aganju, andbore ason
named Orungan. Thisname iscompounded oforun,
sky,andgan,from ga,tobehigh; andappears to
mean"Intheheight ofthesky." Itseems toanswer
tothe Ichelcheme, or"Free-air Region" oftheEwe
peoples ;and, like it,tomean theapparent space be-
tween theskyandtheearth. The offspring ofLand
andWater would thusbewhatwecallAir.
Orungan fellinlovewith hismother, and asshe
refused tolisten tohisguilty passion, heonedaytook
advantage ofhisfather's absence, andravished her.
Immediately after the act,Yemaja sprang toherfeet
and fledfrom theplace wringing herhands and
lamenting; andwaspursued byOrungan, who strove
toconsole herbysaying thatnooneshould know of
what had occurred, anddeclared thathecould not
livewithout her.Heheld outtoherthealluring
prospect ofliving withtwohusbands, oneacknow-
ledged, andtheother insecret ;butsherejected all


CHIEF GODS. 45
liisproposals with loathing, andcontinued torun
awa3^ Orungan, however, rapidly gained upon her,
andwas just stretching out hishand toseize her,
when she fellbackward totheground. Then her
bodyimmediately began toswell inafearful manner,
twostreams ofwater gushed from herbreasts, and
herabdomen burst open. Thestreams from Yemaja's
breasts joined andformed alagoon, andfrom her
gaping bodycame thefollowing:—(1)Dada (god of
vegetables), (2)Shango (god oflightning), (3)Ogun
(god ofironandwar), (4)Olokun (god ofthe sea),
(5)Olosa (goddess ofthelagoon), (6)Oya (god-
dess oftheriver Niger), (7)Oshun (goddess ofthe
river Oshun), (8)Oba (goddess oftheriver Oba),
(9)Orisha Oko (god ofagriculture), (10)Oshosi
(god ofhunters), (11)Oke(god ofmountains), (12)
AjeShaluga (god ofwealth), (13)Shankpanna (god of
small-pox), (14.)Orun (the sun),and(15)Oshu (the
moon).* Tocommemorate this event, atownwhich
wasgiven thename ofIfe(distention, enlargement, or
swelling up),was built onthespotwhere Yemaja's
body burst open, andbecame theholy city ofthe
Yoruba-speaking tribes. The place where herbody
fellused tobeshown, andprobably still is ;butthe
townwasdestroyed in1882, inthewarbetween the
IfesontheonehandandtheIbadans andModakekes
ontheother.
Themyth ofYemaja thusaccounts fortheorigin of
several ofthegods,bymaking them thegrandchildren
ofObatala andOdudua ;butthere areother gods,who
*The order, according tosome, wasOlokun, Olosa, Shango,
Oya,Oshun, Oba,Ogun, Dada, andtheremainder asabove.


46 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
donotbelong tothisfamily group, andwhose genesis
isnotaccounted forinanyway. Two, atleast, of
theprincipal gods areinthiscategory, andwethere-
fore leave forthemoment theminor deities who
sprung fromYemaja, andproceed with thechief gods,
irrespective oftheir origin.
(5)Shango.
Shango, thegodofthunder andlightning, is,next
toObatala, themost powerful godoftheYorubas;he
wasthesecond tospring from thebody ofYemaja.
Hisname appears tobederived from shan, "to
strike violently," and go,"tobewilder ;"andtohave
reference topeals ofthunder, which aresupposed to
beproduced byviolent blows.* Hehastheepithet
ofJakuta, "Hurler ofstones," or"Fighter with
stones"(Ja,tohurlfrom aloft, orjci,tofight, and
olcuta, stone) ;andstone implements, which have long
ceased tobeused in"West Africa, arebelieved tobe
histhunderbolts.
Towield thethunderbolt iscertainly one ofthe
proper functions ofthesky-god, andtheprocess by
which hebecomes deprived ofitisnotbyanymeans
clear. Itdoesnotappear tobetheresult ofadvanc-
ingculture, fortheZeus oftheGreeks andtheJupiter
oftheRomans, whohad respectively theepithets
Kerauneios andTonans, retained it ;asdotheNyan-
kupon oftheTshis and theNyomno oftheGas;
while, liketheEwes andYorubas, theAryan Hindus

made anotlier god,namely, Indva, offspring ofDyaus,
wield thelightning.
Thenotion wefound amongst theEwes that abird-
likecreature wastheanimating entity ofthethunder-
storm hasnoparallel here, andShango ispurely
anthropomorphic. Hedwells intheclouds inan
immense brazen palace, where hemaintains alarge
retinue andkeeps agreat number ofhorses;for,
besides being thethunder-god, heisalso thegod of
thechase andofpillage.* From hispalace, Shango
hurls upon those whohave offended him red-hot
chains ofiron, which areforged forhimbyhis
brother Ogun, god oftheriverOgun, ofironand of
war ;butthis, itshould beobserved, isseemingly a
modern notion, andthered-hot chains furnished by
Ogun have asuspicious resemblance tothethunder-
bolts ofJupiter, forged byYulcan. TheYoruba
word forlightning ismana-mana (ma-ina, amaking
offire), andhasnoconnection either with iron (irin)
orachain (eivon) ;while thename Jakuta shows that
Shango isbelieved tohurl stones andnotiron. The
iron-chain notion, therefore, appears tohave been
borrowed from some foreign source, and,moreover,
not toyethavemade much progress. The Oni-
Shango, orPriests ofShango, fintheir chants always
speak ofShango ashurling stones ;andwhenever a
house isstruck bylightning they rush inabody to
pillage itand tofindthestone, which, astheytake

itwith tliem secretly, tliey always succeed indoing.
Acliant oftheOni-Shango verycommonly heard is,
"Oh,Shango, thou artthemaster. Thou takestm
thyhand thy fiery stones, topunish theguilty and
satisfy thine anger. Everything thatthey strike is
destroyed. Their fireeatsupthe forest, thetrees
arebroken down, and allliving creatures areslam;
andthelay-worshippers ofShango flock into the
streets during athunderstorm crying, "Shango,
Shango, areatKing !Shango isthelordandmaster.
Inthestorm hehurls hisfiery stones against his
enemies, andtheir track gleams inthemidst ofthe
darkness." "May Shango's stone strike you," isa
verycommon imprecation.
According tosome natives, Oshumare, theEainbow,
istheservant ofShango, his office being totakeup
water from theearth tothepalace intheclouds. He
hasamessenger named Ara,"Thunder-clap," whom
hesends outwith aloud noise.Asmall bird called
;papagori issacred toShango, and hisworshippers
profess tobeable tounderstand itscry.
Shango married three ofhissisters :Oya,theNiger;
Oshun, theriver ofthesame name, which rises in
Ijesa Indflows into thewater-way between Lagos
andtheLekki lagoon, nearEmina; andOba, alsoa
river, which rises inIbadan andflows intotheKradu
Water. Allthreeaccompany theirhusband when he
goes out,Oyataking with herhermessenger Afefe
(theWind, orGale ofWind), andOshun andOba

and, onimportant occasions, human beings. His
colours areredand white. He isconsulted with
sixteen cowries, which arethrown ontheground,

Heusually goesarmed with aclub called oshe,made
ofthewood oftheayan tree,which issohard that a
proverb says, "Theayan tree resists theaxe." In
consequence ofhisclubbeingmade ofthiswood, the
tree issacred tohim.
The priests andfollowers ofShango wear awallet,
emblematic oftheplundering propensities oftheir
lord, andthechief priest iscalled Magba, "The
Receiver." Asamongst theEwe tribes, ahouse
struck bylightning isatonceinvaded andplundered
bythedisciples ofthegod,andafineimposed onthe
occupants, who, itisheld,must have offended him.
Persons who arekilled bylightning may not, pro-
perly speaking, beburied ;but iftherelations ofthe
deceased offer asufficient payment, thepriests usually
allow thecorpse toberedeemed andburied. Indi-
viduals rendered insensible bylightning areatonce
despatched bythepriests, theaccident being regarded
asproof positive thatShango requires them.A

Theforegoing are,with theexception ofthemyth
ofthefiery chains, theoldideas respecting Shango;
butontothem arenow rapidly becoming grafted
some later myths, which make Shango anearthly
kingwho afterwards became agod. This Shango
.
wasKing ofOyo, capital ofYoruba, andbecame so
unbearable through rapacity, cruelty, andtyranny,
thatthechiefs andpeople atlastsenthimacalabash
ofparrots' eggs, inaccordance with thecustom that
hasalready beenmentioned ;with amessage thathe
must befatigued with thecares ofgovernment, and
that itwastime forhimtogotosleep. Onreceiving
thisintimation, Shango, instead ofallowing himself to
bequietly strangled byhiswives, defied public opinion
andendeavoured toassemble hisadherents ;and,when
this failed, sought safety inflight. He left the
palace bynight, intending toendeavour toreach
Tapa, beyond theNiger, which was hismother's
native place ;andwasaccompanied onlybyonewife
andone slave, the rest ofhishousehold having
deserted him. During thenight thewiferepented of
herhasty action, andalso lefthim; so,when inthe
morning Shango found himself lostinthemidst ofa
pathless forest, hehadnoonewithhimbuthisslave.
They wandered about without food forsome days,
seeking invain forapathwhich would leadthem out
oftheforest, andatlastShango lefthisslave, saying,
"Wait here tillIreturn, andwewillthen tryfurther."
After waiting along time, theslave, ashismaster did
notappear, went insearch ofhim,andbefore long


I CHIEF GODS. 51
found Liscorpse hanging bjtheneckfromanayan-
tree. Eventually theslave succeeded inextricating
hunself from theforest, andfinding himself inapart
ofthecountry heknew, made hiswaytowards Oyo,
where hetoldthenews.
When thechiefs andelders heard thatShango had
hanged himself theyweremuch alarmed, fearing that
theywould beheld responsible forhisdeath. They
went, incompany with thepriests, totheplacewhere
theslave had leftthebody, butwere unable tofind
it,for itwasnolonger onthe tree. They searched
inevery direction, andatlastfound adeep pitinthe
earth, fromwhich theendofanironchain protruded.
They stooped over the pitand listened, andcould
hearShango talking down intheearth. They at
once erected asmall temple over the pit,andleaving
some priests there topropitiate thenew god,and
establish aworship, returned toOyo,where they pro-
claimed:"Shango isnotdead. Hehasbecome an
orislia. Hehasdescended into theearth, and lives
among thedead people, withwhomwehaveheardhim
conversing." Some ofthetownspeople, however,
being ignorant andfoolish, didnotbelieve thestory,
andwhen the criers cried, "Shango isnot dead,''
they laughed andshouted inreturn, "Shango is
dead. Shango hanged himself." Inconsequence
ofthiswicked conduct, Shango came inperson,
•with aterrific thunderstorm, topunish them for
their behaviour;and, inorder toshow hispower,
tekilled many ofthe scoffers with his fiery
stones, and set thetown on fire. Then the
priests and elders ranabout among theburnino-

houses, Shouting,"Shango didnothang himself.
Shango hasbecome anorislm. Seewhat these baa
menhavebrought uponyoubytheir unbelief. He is
angry because theylaughed athim,andhehasburned
yourhouses with hisfiery stones because youdidnot
vindicate hishonour." Then thepopulace fellupon
the scoffers andbeatthem todeath, sothatShango
wasappeased, andhisanger turned away, ihepace
where Shango descended intotheearth was called
Kuso, andsoonbecame atown, formany people went
todwell there.
Perhaps thismyth really does refer tosome former
King ofOyo,though whysuch aking should usurp
thefunctions ofthethunder-god, isnotatallclear.
Itisinconsistent inpart, for itmakes thechiefs and
elders alarmed atthesuicide ofShango, because they
feared tobeheld responsible forhisdeath;yetthey
would havebeen equally responsible hadhecomplied
withestabhshed custom, andcommitted suicide when
hereceived theparrots' eggsthey senthim. Theta€t
oftheayanbeing sacred tothegodShango, nodoubt
caused thattreetobeselected forthelegendary suicide
oftheking Shango; andtheironchain which pro-
truded from thehole intheground wasprobably
suggested bythenotion ofred-hot chains oflightning.
Aswehave said, thismyth israpidly becoming blended
with theolder ones, and, inconsequence ofthese events
having taken place atKuso, Shango hasthetitle of
Oha-Kuso, "King ofKuso."
Another myth makes Shango thesonofObatala,
andmarried tothethree river goddesses Oya,Oshun,
andOba,butreigning asanearthly king atOyo. The
story relates thatonedayShango obtained from his


CHIEF GODS. 53
father Obatala apowerful cliarm, wliicli, wlien eaten,
would enable liim tovanquisli allwtioopposed him.
Shango atemost ofthemedicament, andthenga^e
theresttoOya tokeep forhim ;but she,assoon as
hisbackwasturned, atetherestherself. Nextmorn-
ingthechiefs and elders assembled atthepalace as
usual, tojudge the affairs ofthepeople, andeach
spoke inhisturn ;butwhen itcame toShango's turn
tospeak, flames burst forthfrom hismouth, and all
fledinterror. Oya, too,when shebegan toscold her
women inthepalace, similarly belched forth flames, so
thateverybody ranaway, andthepalace wasdeserted.
Shango nowsawthathewas, asagod, inferior to
none ;socalling histhree wives tohim,andtaking in
hishand along iron-chain, hestamped ontheearth
till itopened under him,anddescended into itwith
hiswives. The earth closed again overthem, after
theyhadgonedown, buttheendofthechain wasleft
protruding from theground.
Thismyth well exemplifies theconfusion thathas
nowbeen created inmen's minds between thethunder-
godproper andthedemi-god, theresult being akind
ofcompound Shango, possessing attributes ofeach.
TheShango ofthis story resembles inhismarital
relations thethunder-god, butthedescent into the
earth with theiron chain, theend ofwhich isleft
above ground, islikethelegendary descent ofthe
deified king, and isprobably only another version of
thesame event. Itisprobable that contact with
Mohammedans hashadsomething todowith the
invention ofthismyth. The genii, asweread of
them inthe"Arabian Nights," arefrequently de-
scribed asbreathing forth flames todestroy their

beones atalllikely toliave arisen spontaneously in
thenegro mind, andwefindnothing ofthesortinthe
groups cognate totheYoruba. Moreover, athunder-
godmust, from thevery nature ofhisbeing, hve
above theearth amongst theclouds ;andtomakehim
descend into thebowels ofthe earth, istoplace
him inasituation where hecould notexercise the
functions ofhisoffice. These remarks equally apply
tothefollowing myth.
Since hisdescent into theearth with histhree
wives atOyo, Shango hasoften come back tothe
world. One day,whendown intheearth, hequar-
relled withOya,whohadstolen some ofhis"medi-
cines ;"and she, terrified athisviolence, ranaway,
andtook refuge with her brother theSea-God
(Olokun). Assoon asShango discovered where she
hadgone, heswore agreat oath tobeathersothat
shewould never forget it.Next morning hecame
upfrom below with theSun, and,following him in
hiscourse alltheday,arrived withhimintheevening
attheplace where theseaandsky join, and so
descended withhimintotheterritories ofhisbrother
Olokun. TheSunhadnotknowingly shown Shango
theroad across theskytoOlokun's palace, forShango
hadbeen careful tokeep behind him allthetime,
nearly outofsight, and tohidewhen theSunlooked
round.
When Shango reached Olokun's palace andsawhis
wifeOya there, hemade agreat noise andcommotion.

Ifa,god ofdivination, who isusually termed the
G-od ofPalm Nuts, because sixteen palm-nuts areused
intheprocess ofdivination, comes after Shango in
order ofeminence. Thename Ifaapparently means
something scraped orwiped off :hehasthe title of
Grbangba (explanation, demonstration, proof). Ifa's
secondary attribute istocause fecundity :hepresides
atbirths, andwomen pray tohimtobemade fruitful;
while onthisaccount offerings arealways made to
himbefore marriage, itbeing considered adisgrace
nottobear children. Tothenative mind there isno
conflict offunction between IfaandObatala, forthe
former causes thewoman tobecome pregnant, while
thelatter forms thechild inthewomb, which issup-
posed tobeadifferent thing altogether.

inhabitants ofIfehow toforetell future events, but
theywould notlisten tohim, soheleftthetown and
wandered about theworld teaching mankind. After
roaming about foralong time, andindulging ina
variety ofamours, Ifafixed hisresidence atAdo,
where heplanted onarock apalm-nut, from which
sixteen palm-trees grewupatonce.
Ifahasanattendant orcompanion named Odu

(ojje, puzzle, orope, palm-tree). The bandicoot
(oTcete) issacred tohim,because itlives chiefly upon
palm-nuts. The firstdayoftheYoruba week isIfa's
holy day,and iscalled ajoawo, "dayofthesecret."
Onthisdaysacrifices ofpigeons, fowls, andgoats are
made tohim,andnobody canperform anybusiness
before accomplishing this duty. Onvery important
occasions ahuman victim isimmolated.

Thegeneral belief isthat Ifapossessed thefaculty
ofdivination from thebeginning, butthere isamyth
which makes himacquire theartfrom thephallic god
Elegba. Intheearly days oftheworld, saysthemyth,
there were butfewpeople ontheearth, andthegods
found themselves stinted inthematter ofsacrifices to
suchanextent that, notobtaining enough toeatfrom
theofferings made bytheir followers,* they were
obliged tohave recourse tovarious pursuits inorder
toobtain food. Ifa,whowas inthesame straits as
theother gods, took tofishing, with, however, but
small success ;andoneday,when hehad failed to
catch any fish atall,andwasvery hungry, he
consulted thecrafty Elegba, whowas also inwant,
astowhat theycould dotoimprove their condition.
Elegba replied that ifhecould only obtain
the sixteen palm-nuts from the two pahns
thatOrungan,t the chief man,had inhisplanta-
tion, hewould show Ifahow toforecast the
future; and thathecould then usehisknowledge
intheservice ofmankind, andsoreceive anabund-
ance ofofferings. Hestipulated that inreturn for
instructing Ifaintheartofdivination, heshould
always beallowed the first choice ofallofferings
made.. Ifaagreed tothebargain, andgoing to
Orungan, asked forthesixteen palm-nuts, explaining

however, were toolofty forthem tobeable toreach
thepalm-nuts, and thestems toosmooth tobe
climbed; sothey retired toalittle distance and
drove somemonkeys thatwere inthevicinity into
thepalms. Nosooner were themonkeys inthe
trees than they seized thenuts, and, after eating the
redpulp thatcovered them, threw thehard kernels
down ontheground, where Orungan and hiswife
picked them up.Having collected thewhole sixteen,
Orisha-bi tiedthem upinapiece ofcloth, andput
thebundle under herwaist-cloth, onherback, asif
shewere carrying achild. Then they carried the
palm-nuts toIfa. Elegba kept hispromise and
taught Ifatheartofdivination, andIfainhisturn
taught Orungan, whothnsbecame the first habalaiuo,

James Hamilton, indeed, describes *avery similar
mode ofdivination wliicli liesaw intheoasis of
Siwab, where itwas called Derh elful, orDerh el

Hesays :"Seven beans are lield inthepalm ofthe

theright half-closed fist, sothatsome ofthebeans
jump intotherighthand—ifanoddnumber, one is

andtheresult marked below the first. This being-
repeated four times gives the first figure, andthe

Ifa fio-ures inconnection witli alegendary deluge,
tliestory ofwhich, now adapted totheYoruba
theology, wasprobably derived from theMoham-
medans. Some time after settling atAdo, Ifabe-
came tired ofliving intheworld, andaccordmgly
went todwell inthefirmament, with Obatala.
After his departure, mankind, deprived ofhis
assistance, was unable toproperly interpret the
desires ofthegods, most ofwhom becamemcon-
sequence annoyed. Olokun was themost angry,
and inafitofrage hedestroyed nearly allthe
inhabitants oftheworld inagreat flood, only a
fewbeing saved byObatala, whodrewthem upinto
theskybymeans ofalong iron chain. After this
ebullition ofanger, Olokun retired oncemore tohis
own domains, buttheworld wasnothing butmud,
and quite unfit tolive in, tillIfacamedown from
the sky, and, inconjunction with Odudua, once
moremade ithabitable.
(7)Blegba.
Blegba, orBlegbara (Blegba-Bara), often called
Eshu, isthesame phallic divinity whowasdescribed
inthevolume ontheEwe-speaking Peoples. The
name Blegba seems tomean,"Hewho seizes"
(Eni-gha), andBara isperhaps Oha-ra, "Lord ofthe
rubbing"{Bci, torubonething against another).
Bshu appears tobefrom sliu, toemit, throw out,
evacuate, Thepropensity tomake mischief, which


CHIEF GODS. 65
wenoted asaminor characteristic oftheEwe
Blegba, ismuch more prominent intheYoruba god,
who thusmore nearly approaches apersonification
ofevil.He issupposed always tocarry ashort
knobbed club, which, originally intended tobearude
representation ofthe^phallus, has,partly through want
ofskillonthepart ofthemodellers oftheimages, and
partly through thegrowing belief inElegba's malevo-
lence, come toberegarded asaweapon ofoffence.*
Because hebears this club hehasthe title of
Agongo ogo. Ogo isthename oftheknobbed club,
and ismost probably aeuphemism forthe'phallus;
itisderived from go,tohide inabending orstooping
posture. The derivation ofagongo islesseasy to
determine, but itseems tobefrom gongo, tip,
extremity.
Theimage ofElegba, who isalways represented
naked, seated with hishands onhisknees, andwith
animmensely disproportionate phallus, isfound in
front ofalmost every house, protected byasmall
hutroofed with palm-leaves. Itiswith reference
tothisthattheproverb says :"AsEshw hasamali-
cious disposition, hishouse ismade forhim inthe
street "(instead ofindoors). Therudewooden repre-
sentation ofthephallus isplanted intheearth bythe
side ofthehut,and isseen inalmost every public
place;while atcertain festivals itisparaded ingreat
pomp, andpointed towards theyoung girls,whodance
round it.
Elegba, inconsequence ofthebargain hemade with

Ifa,receives asliare ofevery sacrifice offered tothe
other gods. Hisownproper sacrifices are,asamong
theEwe tribes, cocks, dogsandhe-goats, chosen on
account oftheir amorous propensities ;butonvery
important occasions ahuman victim isoffered. In
such acase, after thehead hasbeen struck off,the
corpse isdisembowelled, andtheentrails placed infront
oftheimage inalarge calabash orwooden dish;after
which thebody issuspended from atree, or,ifnotree
beathand, from ascaffolding ofpoles. Turkey-
buzzards aresacred toBlegba andareconsidered his
messengers, nodoubt because theydevour theentrails
andbodies ofthesacrifices.
There isanoted temple toElegba inagrove of
palms nearWuru, avillage situated about tenmHes
totheeast ofBadagry.Themarket ofWuru isunder
hisprotection, andeachvendor throws afewcowries
ontheground asathank-offering. Once ayear these
cowries areswept upbythepriests, andwith thesum
thus collected aslave ispurchased tobesacrificed to
thegod.Aslave isalso sacrificed annually, towards
theend ofJuly, toBlegba inthetown ofOndo, the
capital ofthe state ofthesame name. Elegba's
principal residence issaid tobeonamountain named
Igbeti, supposed tobesituated near theNiger. Here
hehasavastpalace ofbrass, andalargenumber of
attendants.
Circumcision among theYorubas, asamong the
Ewes, isconnected with theworship ofBlegba, and
appears tobeasacrifice ofaportion oftheorgan
which thegodinspires, toensure thewell-being ofthe
remainder. Tocircumcise isdalco (da-olco) da,tobe

curDcision isiheyiha, orilwla, theformer ofwliicli
means "tliecircular cutting "{ike,theactofcutting,
andiyeka, acircuit), andthelatter, "thecutting that
saves "{ihe, theactofcutting, and ola,thatwhich
saves). Except among theMohammedans there isno
special time forperforming therite ofcircumcision,
itbeing fixed foreach individual bjIfa,after consul-
tation, butusually itisdone early inlife.Nowoman
would have connection with anuncircumcised man.Asimilar operation isperformed ongirls,who are
excised, bywomen operators, shortly before puberty,
that is,between theages oftenandtwelve years.
As isthecase inthewestern half oftheSlave
Coast, erotic dreams areattributed toElegba, who,
either asafemale ormale, consorts sexually withmen
andwomen during their sleep, andsofulfils inhisown
person thefunctions oftheincuU andsuccuU of
medi£Bval Europe.
(S)Ogun.
Ogun isthegodofironandofwar,and, likeShango,
isalsoapatron ofhunters. Iron issacred tohim,
andwhen swearing byOgun itisusual totouch an
ironimplement with thetongue. ThenameOgun
seems tomean "Onewhopierces "{gun, topierce, or
thrust with something pointed). He isspecially
worshipped byblacksmiths, andbythosewhomake
useofironweapons ortools. Any piece ofironcan
beused asasymbol ofOgun, andtheground issacred

Tlieusual sacrifice offered toOgunis adog,together
witli fowls, palm oil,andminor articles offood.A
proverb says,"An olddogmust besacrificed to
Ogun," meaning thatOgun claims thebest; anda
dog's head, emblematic ofthis sacrifice, isalways to
be'seen fastened upinsome conspicuous part ofthe
workshops ofblacksmiths. Onveryimportant occa-
sions, however, ahuman victim isoffered, and, asm
thecase ofasacrifice toElegba, the entrails are
exposed before theimage andthebody suspended
from atree. Thevictim isslainbyhaving hishead
struck offupon thestool ofOgun, overwhich theblood
ismade togush. Thereason ofthis isthattheblood
isbeheved tocontain thevital principle, andtherefore
tobeanoffering particularly acceptable tothegods.
This belief appears tobecommon tomost bar-
barous peoples ;theIsraelites held it,*andblood
was considered tobesopeculiarly theportion of
their national god,thattheblood ofallanimals slam,
whether forsacrifice orfood,hadtobepresented as
anoffering, noonebeing allowed toeat itunder
pain ofdeath.t
When warhasbeen decided upon, aslave ispur-
chased attheexpense ofthetown, ortribe, and
offered asasacrifice toOgun, toensure success. The
daybefore thatonwhich heistobeimmolated, the
victim isledwith great ceremony through theprin-
cipal thoroughfares, andparaded inthemarket,
where heisallowed tosayordoanything hepleases
(short ofescaping hisimpending fate),may gratify his

desire witlianywoman wliotakes liisfancy, andgive
histongue every licence. Tliereason ofliisbeing
thushonoured forthetwenty-four hours before being
sacrificed, isthat itisbelieved hewillbeborn again
andbecome aking;and, after thehead hasbeen
struck off,thecorpse istreated with thegreatest
respect by all.Inorder forthis sacrifice tobe
effective, itisnecessary that thewarleaders should
take the field before thebody begins tobecome
offensive. The Ibadans, whoappear toberather
averse tohuman sacrifice, always used toperform
thisdutybydeputy, paying thepriests ofIfetosacri-
ficeforthem aslave inthat town. When thewar
of1877began theyomitted todothis,thinking that
theaffair would notbeserious;and, attributing their
subsequent want ofsuccess totheomission, they after-
wards sacrificed aslave toOgun intheircamp at
Kijiin1885, theyhaving been prevented from doing
itearlier bytheir leader, aMohammedan, who died
inthatyear.
The priests ofOgun usually takeoutthehearts of
human victims, which aredried, reduced topowder,
thenmixed withrum,and sold topersons whowish
tobeendowed with great courage, andwho drink
themixture. Thereason ofthis isthat theheart is
believed tobetheseat ofcourage and toinherently
possess that quality ;andthatwhen theheart is
devoured orswallowed thequality withwhich itis
inspired isalsotaken intothesystem.

tliose wliocame from tliebody ofYemaja.
Asman worships tliatfrom wliicli liehasmost to

beenmade inrecent times, even atLagos, bytlie
people oftlieIsaleko quarter, wlio are cliiefly wor-
shippers ofOlokun. The sacrifice was ofcourse
secret, andaccording tonative report thecanoemen
used towatch bynight tilltheycaught some solitary
wayfarer, whom theygagged andconveyed across
thelagoon tothesea-shore, where they struck off
hisheadandthrew thebody intothesurf.
Amyth says that Olokun, becoming enraged
withmankind onaccount oftheir neglect ofhim,
endeavoured todestroy them byoverflowing the
land ;andhaddrowned largenumbers when Obatala
interfered tosave theremainder, andforced Olokun
back tohispalace, where hebound himwith seven
iron chains tillhepromised toabandon hisdesign.
This, perhaps, has reference tosome former en-
croachment oftheseaupon thelow-lying sandy
shores, which areevennow liable tobesubmerged
atspring-tides.*
Olokun hasawifenamed Olokun-su, orBlusu, who
lives intheharbour baratLagos. She iswhite in
colour andhuman inshape, but iscovered with
fish-scales from below thebreasts tothehips. The
fish inthewaters ofthebararesacred toher,and

Olosa {oni-osa, owner ofthelagoon) isthegoddess
oftheLagos Lagoon, andtheprincipal wife ofher
brother Olokun, the sea-god. Like herhusband
she islong-haired. Shesprang from thebody of
Yemaja.
Olosa supplies hervotaries with fish,andthere are
several temples dedicated toheralong theshores of
thelagoon, where offerings offowls andsheep are
made tohertorender herpropitious. When the
lagoon isswollen byrainandoverflows itsbanks she

victim isoffered toher, toinduce hertoreturn within
herproper limits.
Crocodiles areOlosa' smessengers, andmay not

goddess theofferings which thefaithful deposit on

Some crocodiles, selected bythepriests onaccount
ofcertain marks borne bythem, aretreated with
great veneration ;andhave rude sheds, thatched
withpalm leaves, erected fortheir accommodation
near thewater's edge. Food isregularly supplied

withwhich asmall-pox patient iscovered, and alc-
pania* aman-killer, homicide. He isaccompanied
byanassistant named Buku,t who killsthose attacked
bysmall-pox bywringing their necks.
Shan-kpanna isoldandlame, and isdepicted as
limping along withtheaidofastick. According to
amyth hehasawithered leg.One day,when the
godswere allassembled atthepalace ofObatala, and
weredancing andmaking merry, Shankpanna endea-
voured tojoin inthedance, but,owing tohisdefor-
mity, stumbled and fell. Allthegodsandgoddesses
thereupon burst outlaughing, andShankpanna, in
revenge, strove toinfect them with small-pox, but
Obatala came totherescue, and, seizing hisspear,
drove Shankpanna away. From thatdayShank-
panna wasforbidden toassociate with theother g-ods,
andhebecame anoutcast whohassince lived indeso-
lateanduninhabited tracts ofcountry.
Temples dedicated toShankpanna arealways built

esses inhisservice.
Although his first care istopromote thefertility
oftheearth, heisalso thegod ofnatural fertility
ingeneral, forheisaphallic divinity, andhisimage
isalways provided with anenormous ])haTlus. He
thusresembles Priapus, who, although aphallic deity,
was, apparently, primarily agarden-god, whofostered
andprotected crops. (Catullus, xix.xx.; Tibullus, i.i.)
Anemblem ofOrisha Oko isanironrod,andhoney
bees arehismessengers. Itisprobably with refer-
ence tohisphallic attributes thathehasthe title of
Eni-chLru—"theerect personage." One ofhisfunc-
tions istocure malarial fevers, towhich thosewho
disturb thesoilintheprocess ofcultivation arepar-
ticularly liable.
There isanannual festival toOrisha Oko, held
when theyam crop isripe,and allthen partake of
newyams. Atthis festival general licence prevails,
thepriestesses givethemselves indiscriminately toall
themale worshippers ofthegod,and, theoretically,
every man hasaright tosexual intercourse with
everywoman hemaymeet abroad. Social prejudices
have, however, restricted theapplication ofthis pri-
vilege, and itisnowonly slave-girls, orwomen ofthe
lowest order, who arereally atthedisposal ofthe

Atthisfestival allkinds ofvegetable productions are

some with Olokun, and theremainder with their

Thus allthesonswere driven outofthesky,butthe

In tliemjtlis oftlieorigin oftlie various gods

some other explanation oftheir origin became neces-
sary;forman,however lowhemaybeinthescale of

Tlie deities Obatala andOdudna represent, say
thepriests, Heaven andEarth. Olorun istliereal
Heaven-god, orSky-god, answering to tlieEVve
Mawn, bnt lieisnowalmost pushed outo£sight, and
Obatala, amore active agent, acts forhim. The dif-
ference between Olorun andObatala appears tobe
thattheformer isthepersonal divine firmament, and
the latter ananthropomorphic sky-god, alater con-
ception; andweperhaps here seearepetition ofthe
process bywhich inthereligion ofancient Greece
Kroiios supplanted Uranus. Obatala, orHeaven,
marries Odudna, orEarth,* andhastwo children,
named Aganju andYemaja, who, according tothe
priests, represent Land andWater. These twointer-
marry andhave ason,Orungan, "Air," theregion
between thesolidfirmament andtheearth. Orungan
ravishes hismother Yemaja, who, while endeavouring
toescape from further outrage, fallsandbursts open,
whereupon anumber ofgodsemerge from hergaping
body.
Thegodswhose origin isthusaccounted forasthe

common origin alike totheancient godsandtothose
which aremore modern.
There are,however, other godswhodonotbelong
tothisfamily circle ;that is,they arenotdescendants
ofObatala andOdudua, sothemythological scheme
isincomplete, noattempt being made toaccount for
their origin. These gods aretheGrod ofDivination
(Ifa), theForest-god (Aroni), thePhallic-god (Elegba),
theHarmattan Wind (Oye), theRainbow (Oshumare),
thetutelary deity ofhouseholds (Olarosa), thegodof
Medicine (Osanhin), and Shigidi. These also areof
various types. TheHarmattan Wind andtheRain-
bow areISTature-gods oftheoldorder, andAroni, god
offorests, ofthenew. Olarosa andOsanhin are
tutelary deities, andShigidi ispersonified nightmare.
Ifawasprobably originally theGod offecundation,
though now hischief function istoforetell thefuture.
Elegba, primarily aphallic divinity, seems tobe

Theincompleteness ofttescheme seems, ashasbeen
said, toshow'that themyth ofYemaja iscomparatively
recent, and this issupported bythefact that the
myth itself isnotuniversally accepted initsentirety.
Shango, forexample, issaidbysome tobeofmde-
pendent origin, likeIfa ;andOdudua, themother of
Yemaja, according tothemyth, isbyothers included
inthenumber ofthosewhosprang fromYemaja's

arrived at,butthemyth ofYemaja istheonlyone
thatholds the field,andnodoubt incourse oftime

Wefindthesamewant ofaccord inthemyths ofthe
origin ofman. According tosome, Obatala made the
firstmanandwoman outofclayormud,whence he
hasobtained his titles ofAlamorere andOrisha
Kpokpo; while, according toothers, the first pair
came, with thegods, from thebody ofYemaja. Al-
though thefirststorysomewhat resembles theaccount
oftheorigin ofman given intheBook ofGenesis,
there isnoreason forsupposing ittobeborrowed.

forthat firstpairbythetheory thattheyweremade

images being ordinarily made ofclayevenwhen the
artshavesomewhat advanced, thiswould bethesub-
stance which themyth-makers would introduce into
theirmyths describing theorigin ofthe first pair, a
connection ofideas between clayandthehuman form
already existing.*
Thesecond story, which cannot beanyolder than
themyth ofYemaja, ofwhich itisapart, issufficiently
precise togive thename ofthe first couple, that
oftheman being Obalofun (Lord ofSpeech), and
that ofthewoman lya(Mother). After coming out
ofthegoddess atIfe,they settled there, andhada
numerous progeny, which increased and multiplied
tillthewhole earth waspopulated, hence itisthat
Ife isconsidered thecradle ofthehuman race. Of
course Obalofun andlyawere Yorubas, for itisa
peculiarity ofevery uncivilised people tobelieve that
thefirstmanandwoman were oftheir race.
Another tradition, though itmakes Ifetheplace
oforigin oftheYoruba tribes, represents itasbeing
colonised bypersons migrating from the interior.

Gold Coast alsohave atradition ofamigration from
theinterior. Most probably thetwotraditions refer
toagreat southward movement oftheoriginal stock
fromwhich theTshi, Ga,Ewe,andYomba tribes are
descended, andwhich, starting from some central
point intheinterior, spread outinfan-shape till it
reached thesea-coast. The tradition oftheYoruba
migration isasfollows.
Long agoacertain person living inthefarinterior
sent fifteen people from hiscountry togotothe
south, andwiththem came, ofhisown free will,one
named Okambi,* who afterwards became the first
King ofYoruba. When theywere leaving, theper-
sonwho sentthem gaveOkambi aslave, atrumpeter
named Okinkin,t afowl, andsomething tiedupina
piece ofblack cloth. They journeyed forsome time,
andwhen theyopened thegate ofthesouth and
passed intotheunknown country, theyfound nothing
butwater spread outbefore them. At firstthey
thought ofreturning, butfearing tlieanger ofthe
person whohad sentthem, they entered thewater;
and, finding itquite shallow, waded onthrough it.
Thisthey didforsome time untilOkinkin thetrum-
peter sounded histrumpet, inaccordance with the
instructions theperson had given, andthereby re-
minded Okambi ofthesomething tiedupinblack

Okinkin thetrumpeter that itwas hisduty tosound

Okambi untied thepiece ofblack cloth asecond time.
When itwasopened, earth fellfrom it,and, drying
upthewater, made asmall mound. Thefowl that
thepersonage hadgiven Okambi then flewontothe
mound andscratched theearth hereandthere, and
wherever theearth fell itdriedupthewater. When
therewasagood space covered with earth, Okambi

This tradition isvague andmeagre ofdetail, the
only points brought outbeing that acertain number
ofpersons migrated southward from theinterior, and
found aregion covered with water. This latter de-
tail,however, strongly supports thetheory thatareal
migration took place; forthelarge stretches ofshallow
water ofthelagoon system, which during therainy
season areenormously extended bytheinundation of
thelow-lying portions ofthesurrounding country,
could scarcely have failed toexcite thewonder ofa

CHAPTER V.
PEIESTS ANDWOESHIP.
TheYomba priesthood isdivided into recognised
orders, butbefore describing tliem itwillbeneces-
sary togivesome account ofasecret society which is
inseparably connected with thepriesthood, andwhich,
except inJebu, where itiscalled Oshogbo, isknown
astheOgboni Society.
TheOgboni Society really holds thereins ofgovern-
ment, andkings themselves areobliged tosubmit to
itsdecrees. Themembers arepopularly believed to
possess asecret fromwhich they derive their power,
buttheir only secret appears tobethat ofapowerful
andunscrupulous organisation, eachmember ofwhich
isbound toassist every other, while allarebound to
carry out,and ifnecessary enforce, thedecrees ofthe
body. Eachtownandvillage has itsOgboni "lodge,"
andthemembers recognise eachotherbyconventional
signs andpasswords. Attheir meetings, which are
heldwith agreat affectation ofmystery, they delibe-
rateupon allmatters which interest thetribe orcom-
munity. The decisions oftheOgboni are final, and
nothing ofimportance canbedone without their
consent When themissionaries wished toestablish
themselves atAbeokuta, theking could notgrant the

necessary permission till tlieOgbonis hadconsidered
tliematter andsignified their consent. Thepower of
theOgbonis, however, varies indifferent states, and
inIbadan theyseem tobelittle more than public
executioners.
Ofcourse, since theorganisation issecret, little can
really beknown about it.Death issaid tobethe
penalty forbetraying thesecrets oftheorder. Ac-
cording tonative report, amember who hasbeen
convicted ofsuchanoffence isplaced inanarrow cell,
with hislegsprotruding through twoholes inthe
wall intoanadjoining cell,where they arefastened to
twostakes driven intotheearthen floor. Theexecu-

According tosome natives theOgboni Society has
for itschief object thepreservation ofestablished
religious customs, while according toothers itis
principally occupied with the civilpower. Itreally
appears toconcern itself with every matter ofpublic
interest, andseems toresemble inallimportant par-
ticulars avery similar society, called Porro, which is
foundamong theTimnis ofSierra Leone. What is
quite certain isthat theprotecting deity ofthe
Ogboni isthegoddess Odudua, who isgenerally
spoken ofbymembers byher titleHe(Earth).
Itseems probable that the society was originally
intended forthe initiation tomanhood ofyouths
whohad arrived atpuberty, liketheBoguera of

Winwood Reade,* and that itscivil and judicial
functions arelater usuriDations. Ifthiswere so, it
would tosome extent beconnected with phallic
worship, and phallic emblems areverycommonly
seen carved onthedoors ofOgboni lodges. The
name Ogboni isprobably derived from Ogba, "Com-
panion."
TheAlafin ofYoruba isthechief ofalltheOgboni,
andhethus isable toexert influence beyond the
limits ofhisownkingdom. Inmost states thechief
oftheOgboni isthehead ofthepriesthood, and is
styled Ekeji OrisJm, "JsText totheGods." Hecon-
vokes councils ofpriests onextraordinary occasions,
anddecides disputed points. InJebu everyman of
rank isanOshogbo, butinIbadan, ashasbeen said,
theOgboni seem chiefly toexercise thefunctions of
executioners. Criminals aredelivered tothem for
execution and areput todeath secretly inthe
Ogboni lodge. Theheads areafterwards fixed toa
tree inthemarket-place, butthebodies arenever
seen again, andtherelatives arethus unable togive
them the rites ofsepulture, which isconsidered a
great disgrace.
TheYoruba priesthood (Olorisha, priest) isdivided
intothree orders, each ofwhich isfurther subdivided
intoranks orclasses.
The firstorder comprises three ranks, viz. (1)the
Babalawo, orpriests ofIfa;(2)priests who practise
medicine, andwhoserve Osanhin andAroni, gods of

Thepriests, besides acting asintermediaries between

prepare and sellcharms, amulets, &c.The priests
ofIfaarediviners proper, butother priests also
practise divination, though notwith palm-nuts and

one,called hehe, isacasting oflotsbymeans ofsmall
sticks orstalks ofgrass, each ofwhich represents
aparticular individual; another, called gogo, isa
drawing oflots.Acertain number ofgrass stalks,
oneofwhich isbent, areheld inthehand orwrapped
inapiece ofcloth, sothat theends onlyshow; and
each person inturn draws one, thebent stalk in-
dicating theonewho isinfault. Theperson of
apriest issacred, and violence offered toone is
severely punished.
The office ofpriest ishereditary inthefamilies of
priests, butmembers arerecruited inother modes.
Seminaries foryouths and girls, likethose ofthe
losio oftheEVve tribes, arearegular institution, andmthem applicants forthepriestly office undergo a
novitiate oftwoorthree years, attheendofwhich

Thetemples oftutelary deities oftowns areusually
tobefound inthecentral square ofthetown, ornear

offamilies orhouseholds near thehouse-door orin

thetemples ofthechief gods, butthose ofthepro-
tecting deities ofhouseholds aremere miniatures, and
aresometimes onlysmall sheds, open attheendsand
sides. Besides these structures, which areseen in
every street, oneoften finds larger huts, circular in
shape, thatched with grass, andlarge enough tocon-
tainaseated man. These, which might bemistaken
fortemples but forthefact thatthey contain no
images, arebuilt fortheaccommodation ofpious per-

called HeOrisha, "House oftheOrisha."
TheYoruba gods arealmost invariably represented
byimages inhuman form, which appear grotesque,
butarenotmeant tobeso,thegrotesqueness being
merely theresult ofwant ofskill. These images are
regarded asemblems ofabsent gods. They" them-
selves arenotworshipped, andthere isnoidolatry in
theproper sense oftheword, though nodoubfc there
isatendency toconfuse thesymbol with thegod.

Inimportant temples, andalsointhehouses ofkings

andaportion oftheblood ofthevictims immolated is
always sprinkled upon thesymbolic carvings, upon
which palm-wine, theyolks ofeggs,andthefeathers of
sacrificed chickens arealsosmeared. Inthiscasethe
offering istotheprotecting spirit ofthedrum, which
isthat ofaslavewhohasbeen sacrificed onit.This
plan ofsupplying anartificial guardian-spirit for

provided forthe"stools"ofkings andchiefs, aswell

Asliasalready been mentioned, eacligod liascer-
tainanimals which itisproper tosacrifice tohim;
tousethephraseology oftheOldTestament, every
godhas his"clean" and his"unclean "animals.
Some sacrifices are"unclean "toallthegods, asthe
turkey-buzzard (gunu-gitnu), thevulture (aJcala), and
thegrey parrot (ofe). Asthetwoformer devour
offalandcarrion, and are,infact, scavengers, wecan
seeareason forconsidering them unclean ;butwhy
thegrey parrot should alsobesoconsidered isnot
evident. The natives endeavour toaccount forthe
"uncleanliness "ofthese birds bytwopopular say-
ings,which runasfollows:—
"Theturkey-buzzard wasrequired tooffer sacrifice,
butherefused todoso ;thevulture wasrequired to
offer sacrifice, buthealsorefused. When thepigeon
wasrequired tooffer sacrifice, hedidso."
"Thegrey parrot being required tooffer sacrifice,
refused tooffer it;butthegreen parrot took the
sacrifice and offered it.After all,thegrey parrot is
acitizen ofOyo (the capital ofYoruba) andthegreen
parrot aninhabitant ofthecountry, andyetpeople
thought thatthegrey parrot wasnotwise."
Astheturkey-buzzard, vulture, andgrey parrot
refused tooffer sacrifice, theybecame "unclean,"
while thepigeon andthegreen j)arrot, which offered
it,remained "clean." The latter part ofthesecond
saying appears tobeironical, forthegrey parrot, in
consequence ofitsuncleanliness, isnever offered up,
while thegreen parrot issacrificed.


102 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES,
Onimportant occasions thepriest designates totlie
suppliants tlie sacrifice which hethinks necessary
toinduce thegod tolend afavourable ear.They
prostrate themselves before theshrine with cries of
"Toto, toto-hun,'' anexclamation which denotes humi-
liation and submission, while the priest, inalong
harangue, presents their petition, orcase, tothegod.
Heusually begins hisaddress byflattering thegod,
dwelling upon hisfameandpower, andshowing how
hishumble servitors areentirely dependent upon his
good- will. Then hecalls attention totheself-abase-
ment ofthegod's faithful followers "So-and-so," to
thevalue ofthevictim which theyhavebrought him,
andbegshim tobepropitious and listen totheir
humble prayer. Hethen sacrifices thevictim, sprinkles
some oftheblood ontheimage, pours theremainder
ontheground,* andplaces theheadandentrails ina
shallow earthen vessel infront ofthetemple.
Sacrifices arethus offered inthepresence ofthe
god,that is,before hisimage, which heissupposed
toanimate forthetime being, butthere isoneex-
ception tothisgeneral rule. This is,onoccasions
when sacrifice ismade atcross-roads, oratapoint
where several roads meet, inorder toavert anim-
pending calamity. Inthis case the sacrifice ispro-
bablymade tothelegion ofspirits, mostly evil,who
aresupposed tohaunt the forests anduninhabited
tracts ofcountry ;andthegeneral belief isthat the
approaching danger isdiverted from theproper
road, andturned away from thecommunity which it

threatened. Inreference tothispractice aproverb
says,"The cross-roads donotdread sacrifices."*
Sometimes, inresponse totheajDpeal ofthepriest,
thegodanswers inabird-like, twittering voice, first
heard whispering atalittle distance andthencoming
nearer. When thisoccurs, theworshippers lie]3rone
with their faces totheground, awe-stricken, while
thepriest carries onaconversation with the spirit-
voice, andsubsequently interprets ittotheauditors.
This conception thataspirit-voice should beatwitter-
ing,chirping, orwhistling sound isverywide-spread;
asDr.Tylor hasshown, itused toexistamong the
Greeks andRomans, and itmay atthepresent day
befoundamong theIndian tribes ofNorth America,
theZulus, andthePolynesians.! The spirit-voice is
nodoubt produced byaconfederate priest, bymeans
ofablade ofgrass, oraleaf, placed between the
teeth.
Theimage ofagodwhich ismerely tutelar toone
individual isonlytreated with respect during the life
ofthat individual, after which itisthrown away.
Since thegod ispersonal totheindividual, andhasno
other purpose than toprotect him, theimage isonly
ofuseasavehicle ofcommunication between them so
long astheman lives. After hisdeath thegodno
longer enters oranimates theimage, which, inconse-
quence loses itssacred character, andbecomes an
ordinary object ofnovalue. Thus, whenever aman
dies, histutelary god, ifhehad one, isthrown away

Toytliesuryiving members oftliehouseliold, andthe
extraordinary belief, heldbysome Europeans, that
thenegro makes andbreaks hisgods atwill,may
probably beaccounted forasamisconception ofthis
practice.
Although human sacrifices occur amongst the
Yoruba tribes, wefindamong themnoparallel tothe
wholesale slaughters which take place, orrather used
totake place, inAshanti andDahomi. Thereason
nodoubt is,thattheYoruba kings and chiefs arenot
sufficiently powerful tobeable tosacrifice lifeona
large scale; forthemore powerful themonarch, the
more hecanafford todisregard public opinion, and
since themasses supply thevictims, human sacrifices
arenever regarded bythem with favour. Whether,
whenYoruba wasahomogeneous andpowerful state^
human sacrifices were astate institution, astheywere
inDahomi, wehavenomeans ofascertaining, but all
theprobabilities point inthat direction.
During theperiod that theYorubas have been
known toEuropeans nolarge number ofvictims has
beenputtodeath even ontheoccasion ofthedeath
ofaking.Aking ofOyodiedonApril 27th, 1859,
andonly fourmenwere sacrificed, butforty-two of
hiswives poisoned themselves inorder toaccompany
him totheLand oftheDead. InOndo about twenty
persons were sacrificed when aking died,andthere
wasanestablished procedure, onevictim having tobe
immolated when thecorpse waswashed, four atdif-
ferent entrances tothe palace, andasixth inthe
market-place. Onthedayoftheburial from eight to
tenvictims, with acat,were either killed andinterred


PRIESTS ANDWORSHIP. 105
with thecorpse orburied alive, andduring thethree
months which arerequired toelapse before anew
kingcanbeinstalled there were occasional sacrifices.
In1882 theking ofOndo entered intoanengage-
ment with thegovernment ofLagos toputanendto
human sacrifices, buthedoesnotappear tohavekept
it.Atthepresent day,amongst allthe tribes, when
aking orchief dies itisusual fortwoofhiswives to
commit suicide, andshould novolunteers beforth-
coming, twoareselected andput todeath. Horses
areoften killed andburied with their owners.
There wasuntil very recently, andperhaps still is,
anannual human sacrifice atAbeokuta, called the
"basket-sacrifice," aeuphemism designed toconceal
therealnature oftheceremony. Thevictim was
enclosed inalong basket, asinDahomi, fromwhence
perhaps thecustom wasadopted, thrown down from
aheight, anddespatched byamobarmed with clubs.
Itwasanational offering, butwhen times were pros-
perous thevictim wasoften spared anddedicated toa
god,whose temple-slave hethenbecame. There used
alsotobeanannual sacrifice ofonehuman victim at
Ikoradu, andasimilar offering every sixth year tothe
godOgun atIkriku.
Intimes ofgreat urgency human sacrifices are
offered tosome ofthegods, forexample, toShango,
Ifa,Elegba, Ogun, Olokun, andOlosa ;butthey are
nearly always made atnight, and thepeople are
required toremain intheir houses. There isnone of

tlie last tobeinfluenced byachange ofpublic
opinion, seem toregard buman sacrifice assometbmg
tobedeplored, butoccasionally necessary. The vic-
tim isslaughtered almost insecret, and tliesound of
thetemple-drums andthemournful chants ofthe
assistants alone inform thepeople ofwhat istaking
place. Thenatives avoid anydirect reference tothe
subject."Thenight isbad," they say.Asonthe
Gold Coast, thevictim isalways decapitated infront
oftheimage, sothat theblood from thesevered
arteries mayspurt over it.ForBlegba thebody is
opened andtheentrails placed before himinashallow
dish. Thebody ofaman sacrificed tothesea-god
Olokun isthrown into the sea,andthat ofaman
offered toOlosa intothelagoon.
TheCommissioners whowere sent totheinterior
in1886 tobreak upthecamps ofthebelligerent
tribes, succeeded ininducing therulers ofIjesa
and Ekiti tosignanenactment abolishing human
sacrifices, both tothegods and atthefuneral obse-
quies ofmen ofrank. They endeavoured toobtain
asimilar undertaking from the Ifes,buthere they
metwithsome difficulty. Ifebeing thehome ofhuman

face, with along pointed noseandthin lips, but

Inreturn forthegood news thefamily setfood,

believed that tlieoutside Abikus arehurting him in
order tomake theindwelling Abiku givethem more
toeat;foreverything done tothechild isfeltbyhis
Abiku. The indwelling Abiku isthus, toagreat
extent, identified with thechild himself, and itispos-
sible that thewhole superstition maybeacorruption
oftheGrold Coast belief inthesisa*
Amother who seesher child gradually wasting
away without apparent cause, concludes thatanAbiku
hasentered it,or,asthenatives frequently express
it,that shehasgiven birth toanAbiku, andthat
itisbeing starved because theAbiku isstealing
allitsnourishment. Togetridoftheindwelling
Abiku, and itscompanions outside, theanxious mother
offers asacrifice offood ;andwhile theAbikus are
supposed tobedevouring the spiritual part ofthe
food,andtohave their attention diverted, sheattaches
ironringsandsmall bells totheankles ofthechild,
andhangs iron chains round hisneck. Thejingling
oftheironandthetinkling ofthebells issupposed
tokeep theAbikus atadistance, hence thenumber of
children that aretobeseenwith their feetweighed
down with ironornaments.
Sometimes thechild recovers itshealth, and itis
then believed that thisprocedure hasbeen effective,
andthat theAbikus have been driven away. If,
however, noimprovement takes place, orthechild
grows worse, themother endeavours todrive outthe
Abiku bymaking small incisions inthebody ofthe
child, andputting therein green peppers orspices,

believing that shewillthereby cause pain tothe
Abikn andmakehimdepart. Thepoor child screams
with pain, bntthemother hardens herheart inthe
belief thattheAbiku issuffering equally.
Should thechild die itis,ifburied atall,buried
without anyfuneral ceremony, beyond theprecincts
ofthetown orvillage, inthebush; most other
interments beingmade inthefloors ofthedwelling-
houses. Often thecorpse issimply thrown intothe
bush, topunish theAbiku, saythenatives. Sometimes a
mother, todeter theAbiku which hasdestroyed her
child from entering thebody ofanyother infant she
maybear inthefuture, willbeat, pound, andmutilate
the little corpse, while threatening andinvoking
every evilupon theAbiku which hascaused the
calamity. Theindwelling Abiku isbelieved tofeel
theblows andwounds inflicted onthebody, andto
hearandbeterrified bythethreats andcurses.
Teee-Spirits.
Several varieties oftrees arebelieved tobe
inhabited byindwelling spirits, which arenotexactly
gods, butanswer more tothehama-dryads ofAncient
Greece, ortotheelves ofmedieval Europe. From
theanalogy oftheTshi tribes there islittle doubt
butthat these tree-spirits were once gods ofthe
Srahmantin type, i.e.,ofthetype ofthose which on
theGold Coast arebelieved toanimate thegigantic
silk-cotton trees; butnow, owing tothe great

matter oflessimportance, tliej liave been shorn of
agreat deal oftheirpower, andpushed more intothe
background.
TheAshorin tree isonewhich isinhabited bya
spirit who, itisbelieyed, would, ifitsattention were
notdiverted, drive away anyone whoattempted to
fellthetree. Thewoodman therefore places alittle
palm-oil ontheground asalure,andwhen thespirit
leaves thetree tolickupthedelicacy, proceeds tocutdown itslateabode.
TheApa, frequently called theAfrican mahogany,
ISmhabited byanevil spirit, and iscommonly seen
encircled with palm-leaves, andwithanearthen pot
atItsfoot toreceive theofferings ofwoodcutters.
ItISbeheved toemitaphosphorescent lightbynight.Thewood ofthistree isinsomedemand forthecon-
struction ofdrums, which arehollow wooden cylinders
covered withhide atoneend ;butbefore itcanbecutdown the spirit must bepropitiated byanoffering,
usually consisting ofafowlandsome palm-oil. TheApa istheemblem ofvengeance.
The IroJco (silk-cotton tree) isalsoinhabited bya
spirit, but itisnotvery powerful ormalicious, andwhen aman desires tofellsuch atree itissufficient
protection forhim toinvoke theindwelling spirit of
hisownhead byrubbing alittle palm-oil onhis
forehead. The IroJco isused chiefly forbuilding,
whence probably itcomes tobetheemblem ofrefuge.'Aproverb, referring totherisks aman runs in
cutting down trees inhabited byspirits, says "The
axethatcutsthetree isnotafraid, butthewoodman
covers hisheadwith etu"(amagic powder).

These customs maybecompared with those ofthe
modem Greeks ofSiphinos, one oftheCyclades.
Mr.Bent says*thatwhen thewoodcutters have to
cutdown atreethey suppose tobeinhabited bya
spirit (hamadryad), they areexceedingly careful when
itfalls toprostrate themselves humbly andmsilence,
lestthe spirit should chastise them asitescapes.
Cato alsotinstructs awoodcutter that, inorder to

As isthecaseamong theEwe tribes oftheSlave
Coast, wizards and witches arebytheYorubas
believed tohold nocturnal meetings atthefoot of
trees tenanted byspirits, more especially the^pa,
whose indwelling spirit isbelieved toassistthemm
their malpractices. Here, too,theowlagain appears,
butnow, instead ofthebirdbeing themessenger or
agent ofthetree spirit, itisthewizard {Aje) himself,
whometamorphoses himself intoanowlandproceeds

Witchcraft is,intheminds ofthe natives, the
chief cause ofsickness and death. They cannot,
they think, attribute these evils tothegods, unless
they occur insomeway special toagod; as,for
instance, when aman isstruck bylightning, inwhich
case theevent would beattributed toShango— or
contracts small-pox, when thedisease would beattri-
buted toShanpanna ;forthey arevery careful to
keep ongood terms with thegods, byscrupulously

observing tlieii- religious duties. They consequently
attribute sickness anddeath, other than death result-
ingfrom injury orviolence, tojDersons whohave for
badpurposes enhsted theservices ofevil spirits, that
istosay, towizards andwitches. Witches aremore
common than wizards, andhere, aselsewhere inthe
world, itistheoldest andmost hideous oftheir sex
whoareaccused ofthecrime.
Properly speaking, aperson charged with witch-
craft should besubjected totrialbyordeal, andthen,
iffound guilty, immediately executed;buttheexcited
populace, filled with superstitious terror, frequently
actswithout waiting forproof, andputs theaccused
todeath without trial. Curiously enough, thephe-
nomenon that sofrequently occurred inEngland, when
abelief inwitchcraft wasanarticle offaith, appears
here also;andoldwomen, accused ofbeing witches,
very often acknowledge that they are,andcharge
themselves with deaths which may have recently
occurred inthecommunity.
Amulets andcharms {pnde) arenumerous and of
various kinds. Some, like tlievo-sesao oftheEwe
tribes, arereally thebadges ofdifferent gods, such as
thea^ude, orironarmlet wornbyhunters, whoarethe
servitors ofOgun, god ofiron,andpossess novirtue
ofthemselves, being merely useful asserving to
remind thegods that thewearers areunder their
protection. Others areamulets proper, and are
believed toderive aprotecting power from thegods,
fromwhom they have, through theagency ofthe
priests, been obtained. Amulets aregenerally sewn

Thename ondemeans"oneinbondage," and is

totheSuhman ;namely, thattheamulet isanimated
byanindwelling spirit,whohasbeen confined therein
byasuperior power. Atthepresent time, however,

Anonde fortheprotection oftheperson isworn on

TheYorubas have asuperstition which hasclose
points ofresemblance tothe"changeling "super-
stition ofNorthern Europe. Itisreferred toin
many folk-lore tales, andthefollowing isanexample.
"There lived atOtta"(avillage ontheRiver Ilo,
which isatributary oftheOgun) "awoman named
Bola, whohadamale child. When thechild was
small themother carried himonherbackwhen she
went tomarket, butwhen hebecame about nine
months oldsheused tolayhimdown onamat in
herhouse, fasten thedoor, andgotomarket by
herself. After this italways happened thatwhen
shereturned from themarket shefound that allthe
foodshehad leftinthehouse haddisappeared. This
seemed tohervery strange, andsheatfirst suspected
her neighbours, but shealways found thedoor-
fastening untouched, andwasunable tofathom the
mystery.
"Onedayaneighbour came toherand said,'Iam
going tothemarket atOrichi to-morrow morning
early, andtherefore must askyou torepaymethe
string ofcowries thatyousentyour littleboytoborrow
from me.' Bola,much astonished, declared that she
hadborrowed nocowries from thewoman, andhad
sentnoonetoher ;buttheneighbour persisted that
Bola's childhadcome toher,andhadborrowed astring
ofcowries inthename ofhismother.'Come, then,'
saidBola,'andseemychild.'
"Thetwowomen went into thehouse where the
childwassleeping onhismat. 'You seehim,' said


EGUNGUN, ORO,ANDABIKU. 121
Bola,'there lieis,sleeping. Doyounotseethathe
isyettooyoung towalk ?How then could hecome
toyou ?Andhow could heaskyouforcowries,
seeing thathecannot yettalk ?'
"Theneighbour looked closely atthechild, and
thensolemnly declared that itwas really hewhohad
come toher,butthatwhen hecame hewasmuch
bigger thanhewasnow,andhad theappearance of
achild ofabout tenyears ofage.
"When Bolaheard thisshewasmuch distressed.
Shecould notdoubt herneighbour's word, andshe
feared that herchild must bepossessed byanevil
spirit. Shepaidtheneighbour thestring ofcowries,
andbegged hertosaynothing; then,when thechild's
father came tothehouse, shetoldhim thewhole
story.
"Thefather andmother decided tosearch intothe
mystery. Thefather, therefore, carefully hidhimself
inthehouse, onedaywhile themother andchildwere
out.Then Bolareturned tothehouse with thechild,
puthimdown onthemat, said tohim,'Sleep good
while Igotothemarket,' andthenwent out,and
fastened thedoor asusual.
"Scarcely hadBola gone, than thefather, from his
hiding-place, sawthebaby stand up,andbegin to
grow tillhebecame abigboy. Then hewent tothe
calabashes where thefoodwaskept,andwasbeginning
toeat it,when thefather came outfrom hishiding-
place.
"Immediately thechild saw hisfather hebecame
alittlebaby again, andlayonthefloor crying. He
waspossessed byaspirit. Hismother came back.


122 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
and tlieybeat liim todrive the spirit out,sothatthe
spirit fled."
The parallel between this taleandthechangeling
stories ofISForthern Europe isclose. Inthelatter,
asintheYoruba version, thechangeling, while inthe
presence ofitsfoster-mother andothers, affects tobe
aninfant, butthrows offhisdisguise assoon ashe
imagines himself tobealone. See,forinstance, the
tale called "The Father ofEighteen Elves," in
Arnason's collection ofIcelandic legends.* Theonly
difference—animportant one, itistrue—isinthe
genesis ofthechangehng. InEurope itisanelfin
child,who issubstituted forastolenhuman child, but
here itisthechild himself who ispossessed byan
evil spirit, justasanAbika possesses achild, though
with different results.
Wealsofindasuperstition which recalls that ofthe
were-wolf, forthehyena (Kpelekpe) isoften supposed
tobeamanwhoassumes that disguise atnight, to
preyupon sheep and cattle, and, iftheopportunity
offers, uponhuman beings. Such man-hyenas are
believed tobeable,bymeans ofcertain howls and
cries, tocompel people togoouttothem inthedark
forest tobedevoured. Asimilar belief isfound in
Abyssinia.t Theweird "laugh" ofthehyena, and
itsnocturnal habits, nodoubt account forthissuper-
stition, justassimilar causes have ledtotheowlbeing
universally regarded asabird ofillomen.

women aresometimes transformed into trees, slirubs,

marks, was aYoruba belle ofthatname, whowas
metamorphosed. Herstorj willbefound among the
Tortoise Stories inthechapter onFolklore.
TheIjewa lagoon isalsosaid tohavebeen awoman.
Thestory runs thatapoorwoman, named lyewa, had
twochildren, whom shehadahard struggle tosup-
port; butsheused every daytogowiththem into
theforest togather firewood, which shecarried tothe
town and sold forfood. One day,when following
hercustomary avocation, sheandthechildren, finding
wood scarce, wandered further intotheforest than
usual, and,when itwastime toreturn, they could not
findtheirway out.They walked hither andthither
looking forthepath, butinvain, and atlast, tired
outandtormented with thirst, they laydown torest
under alarge tree. This rested their limbs, but
their thirst increased, and thetwo children filled
theforest with their lamentations, crying totheir
mother forwater. The poor woman, half dis-
tracted, sprang toher feet,andagain searched in
every direction forthepathandforwater, but fruit-
lessly, andwhen atlastshereturned toherchildren
shefound them almost atthelastgasp. Then, pros-
trating herself upon theearth, shecalled upon the
gods tocome toherassistance andsaveherchildren.

grewupthey built ahouse bytheside ofthelagoon,
which, inmemory oftheir mother, they called Odo

CHAPTER VII.
THEINDWELLING- SPIRITS ANDSOULS OFMEN.
Inthe firstvolume ofthis serieswefound that the
Tshi-speaking peoples believe that every man has
dwelling inhim aspirit termed akra,which enters
himatbirth and quitshim atdeath, and isentirely
distinct from the soul, which, atthedeath ofthe
body, proceeds totheLand oftheDead, andthere
continues the lifeformerly ledbytheman inthe
world. Inthesecond volume, wefound that theEwe-
speaking peoples have asimilar belief, theindwelling
spirit being bythem termed aluwo. TheGra-speaking
tribes, situated geographically between theTshiand
Ewe tribes, have modified this belief, andthey assign
toeach individual twoindwelling spirits, called Ida,
onemale andonefemale, theformer being ofabad
andthelatter ofagood disposition. Each Ida,like
thekraandtheluwo, isaguardian-spirit, but—andthis
isanewdeparture—theygivegood orbadadvice, and
prompt good orbad actions, according totheir re-
spective dispositions. TheYorubas alsohave modified
what appears tobetheoriginal theory ofone in-
dwelling andguardian-spirit, andtheyholdthateach
manhasthree spiritual inmates, the first ofwhom,


126 rilEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Olori, dwells inthehead, thesecond, Jpm ijeun, inthe
stomach, andthethird, Ijpori, inthegreat toe.
Olori {Oni-ori, owner, orlord, ofthehead) some-
times called Ori(head, faculty, talent), seems tobe
the spirit which answers tothehraorluwo. He is
theprotector, guardian, and guide. Offerings are
made tohim, chiefly fowls, aswith thekraandluwo,
andsome oftheblood, mixed with palm-oil, isrubbed
upon theforehead. Olori brings good-fortuue, whence
theproverb, "Olori causes theowner ofthehead
toprosper, andnotthecrabonthebank oftheriver."
Thesymbol ofOlori ishalfacalabash studded over
with cowries.
I]jin ijeun, oripinojelmn (ipin, share, portion; ijeun,
actofeating, from jeohun, toeat ;hence "hewho
shares inthefood"), isperhaps considered themost
important ofthethree indwelling spirits, butashe
shares inallthat theman eats, hehasnospecial
sacrifice offered tohim.Aproverb says, "There
isnoorisha like thestomach; itreceives food
every day." Insome respects hunger (ebi) seems
tobepersonified, and tobeconsidered theagent
ofIpin ijeun; forhe issaid tocommunicate to
theman,bypinching hisstomach, thedesire ofhis
principal forfood. Curiously enough, Ipin ijeun is
connected with fire-worship. There isamong the
Yorubas nogod offire,answering totheEwegod
Dso,but fire{ina)wasprobably once personified, for
itisstillspoken ofasAbanigbele, "theInmate." It
isnotclearbywhat process fire-worship came tobe
blended with that oftheindwelling spirit ofthe
stomach; butthe natives explain theconnection


THEINDWELLING SPIRITS ANDSOULS OFMEN. 127
between tlietwobysaying tliat fire isnecessary for
thepreparation offood,andfood isnecessary toIpin
ijeun, therefore hetakes fireunder hisprotection, and
takes care that itisnotextinguished. Aproverbial
saying runs, "I]yin ijeun doesnotallow firetodepart
from theearth." When firecould onlybeproduced
bythetedious process ofrubbing together two sticks,
itwasnodoubt important tokeeponeortwoembers
ofafirealways smouldering.
Ipoi'i, thegreat toe, istheleast important ofthe
three guardian spirits, and sacrifice israrely offered
tohim,except when aman isabout tosetoutona
journey ;inwhich caseheanoints thegreat toewith a
mixture offowl's blood andpalm-oil. Waterfowl are
apparently "unclean "forthispurpose, foraproverb
says,"Awaterfowl isnot fitfortheworship ofI]Jori''
Theghost-man, orsoul, the"vehicle ofindividual
personal existence," iscalled iwin, orolmn, butthe
latter alsomeans "heart." Another word isojiji, or
oji,which hasthemeanings ofghost, shade, or
shadow. After thedeath ofthebody, theghost-man
goes toIpo-ohu, "theLand oftheDead"{fyo,
place; oJm, dead), which isbeneath theearth, and
where eachmandoes thatwhich hehasbeen accus-
tomed todo,andholds thesame social position ashe
didintheworld. Toenable theghost toreach this
land itisessential thatheshould have theprescribed
funeral rites performed over him. Should they be
omitted, theghost wanders about theworld, cold,
hungry, andhomeless, andheruns therisk ofbeing
seized bysome ofthe evil spirits which roam about
theearth ingreat numbers, and castbythem into


128 THEYORUBA-SPEAKfNG PEOPLES.
Orun-aiMcli,"tlieunseen world ofpotsherds," an
uncomfortable place likeapottery furnace, heaped
upwith charcoal andthedebris ofbroken earthen
pots. Funeral rites cannot, ofcourse, beperformed
atthemoment thatbreath leaves thebody, butas
anearnest oftheir intention toperform them, and to
prevent the evil spirits from seizing theghost, the
relations atonce offer asacrifice topropitiate them;
andwhen thecorpse isburied, afowl, called Aclire-
iranna*"thefowl thatbuys theroad," that is,"that
opens aright ofway," issacrificed.
Acomparison ofthe beliefs heldbyuncivilised
peoples concerning thedead, seems toshow thatwhen
inavery low state ofculture, theghost, nodoubt
from theassociation ofideas, isheld toremain inthe
vicinity ofthegrave inwhich thebody wasinterred;
andthatthenotion ofadistinct andseparate place
ofabode forthedead, orDeadland, isonlyformed
when ahigher degree ofculture isattained. The
first belief often lingers onalongside thesecond,
asinEngland, where thechurchyard isconsidered
tobethemost likely place inwhich toseeaghost;
andasimilar survival among theYorubas, oratrace
oftheformer belief, isfound intheword iboji, "a
grave," which means, literally, "place oftheghost"
(ihi,place;oji,ghost).
Thedead often return toearth, andarebornagam
inthefamilies towhich theybelonged intheirformer
life. Infact,onemight saythattheyalways retiirn,
since every mother sends forahahalawo totellher

what ancestral ghost liasanimated liernew-born
child, andthehahalaioo always tells herwhich itis.
Asthebirths atleast equal innumber thedeaths,
andtheprocess ofbeing re-born issupposed tohave
gone on"from thebeginning," logically there ought
tobefew, ifany, departed souls inDeadland ;but
thenatives donot critically examine such questions
asthis,andthey imagine Deadland tobethickly
populated, and atthesame time every new-born
child, oralmost every one, tobeare-born ghost.
Aswasmentioned inthevolume ontheEwe-speaking
peoples,* this belief inmetempsychosis isprobably
aresult ofaconfusion between the noli, ordisem-
bodied luwo (inTshi, thesisa),andthesoul orghost-
man,andwemay here endeavour tosketch inthe
origin andprobable development ofthese various
beliefs.
There canbelittle reasonable doubt butthatthe
notion thatman possesses asoul, anentity that
continues hispersonality after death, arose from
dreams, after themanner shown byMr.Herbert
Spencer inhis"Principles ofSociology." fAman
dreams thatheisgoing through various adventures,
but, astheevidence ofhiscompanions shows him
thathehasnotreally lefttheir company, hecomes
totheconclusion thathehasasecond individuality,
something that ishimself andyet isdetachable, some-
thing thatcangooutofhim,anddoes sogooutwhen
heisasleep. Among thelower races allover the
world, dreams arebelieved tobetheadventures of

the spiritual man wliile detaclied from tliebodily
man during sleep. Then, asliedreams ofmen
whom heknows tobedead and buried, and
naturally dreams ofthem ashewasaccustomed to
seethem, heconcludes that thissecond individuality
canand does exist, entirely independently ofthe
body, after death, andpreserves theappearance and
characteristics ofthebodily-man. Atthisstage of
belief the spiritual-man, orlife-phantom, and the
soul, orghost-man, areoneandthesame. Then,
seemingly, insome cases, thissecond individuality
becomes divided intotwo separate entities— one, a
life-phantom, which enters thebody atbirth, goes
outandindulges inadventures during thesleep of
thebody, and quits itatdeath; theother, asoul,
ordeath-phantom, which, after death, continues the
lifeandpersonality oftheformer bodily-man.
Itispossible that thisconception oftwodifferent
entities wasbrought about, partly atleast, bythe
desire toexplain thereproduction byheredity of
physical characteristics. Children generally resemble
their parents, andfrequently reproduce theirmanner-
ismsmost remarkably. Assoon asthesavage begins

nomenon, which cannot fail toarrest hisattention.

clusion that thedead arereborn again intheir

persons who aredead,whence hebelieves thatthey
exist after death; andhemust often dream ofdead
friends orrelations whose characteristics have been
reproduced intheir children, or,since theyhada
common ancestor, insome collateral member ofthe
same family. Hecannot, then, inthese cases,
conclude that thedead have returned toearth in
thepersons oftheir descendants; fortheevidence
ofhisdreams proves tohimthatthey still exist as
ghost-men, and areinevery respect asthey were
when alive intheworld. Ontheother hand, the
evidence ofhiseyesshows himthat their physical
peculiarities arereborn inchildren now living. He
therefore divides thesecond individuality intotwo—from, sotosay,theIra-soul, which wasoneentity,
hemakes two,theIraandthe soul, theformer of
which inhabits thebody during life,andafter death
enters anewhuman body inthesame family;while
thelatter remains dormant, asitwere, during life,
butafter death continues theexistence oftheman
asanindividual. The reproduction offeatures,
mannerisms, &c., isthus accounted forbythehra,
while thetheory ofthesoul satisfactorily accounts
forwhat the uncivilised man believes tobethe
incontestable evidence ofhisdreams.*
Ifthisview becorrect itwillprobably befound
that several other races have divided theoriginally

TheYorubas, itseems probable, have arrived at
thedoctrine ofmetempsychosis after having passed
through aphase ofbelief similar tothatnowheldby
theTshi andEwe tribes. The belief inone in-
dwelling spirit hasbeenchanged intoabelief inthree
indwelling spirits, and this multiplication hascaused
confusion. These indwelling spirits donot, atthe
death ofthebody, enter anew-born human child in
thesame family, sothat thephenomena ofheredity
cannot beexplained asbeing duetotheir agency;
andtheYorubas have reverted tothetheory ofme-
tempsychosis toaccount forthem. The belief inthe
spirits called abilm isvery probably acorruption of
theformer hra belief, for ifasisa, ordisembodied
hra,enters ahuman body itcauses sickness anddeath,
justastheaUlcu does.
The souls ofthedead aresometimes reborn in
animals, andoccasionally, though butrarely, inplants.
Intheideas ofthenatives, animals, though they differmshape from aman, possess passions andmoral
qualities identical with those ofthehuman being.
Animals also possess souls which, likethesouls of
men, gotoDeadland. Hence, asmenandanimals
have somany characteristics incommon, itdoes not
require anygreat stretch ofimagination forthenative
tofancy that thesoulmaybere-born inananimal.When aplant isconcerned thedifference isgreater;
but if,aswehold, theYoruba tribes passed through a
phase ofbelief similar tothat heldbytheTshi tribes

attliepresent day,they atonetime believed that
trees, shrubs, &c.,and, infact, allthings notmade
byhuman hands, were animated bykras,which may
accoimt fortheextension ofthedoctrine ofmetem-
psychosis toobjects sounlike man.
Theanimal inwhich human souls aremost com-
monly re-born isthehyena, whose half-human laugh
mayperhaps account forthe belief. Human souls
arealsoreborn indifferent kinds ofmonkeys, but
chiefly inthesolitary yellow monkey, called oloyo;
andinthese cases thehuman appearance andcharac-
teristics ofmonkeys nodoubt furnishes thekeytothe
belief.

nourished byhisdecaying body, sothat itmight well
beimagined that thesoul ofthechild, which stayed
with theremains instead ofproceeding toDeadland,
because nofuneral riteshadbeenperformed, passed
intothefungus.
Aswehave said, thesoul, orghost-man, after the
death ofthebody, proceeds toDeadland, and food,
drink, cowries, andproperty ofvarious kinds are
placed inthegrave with thecorpse, toequip the

filled up,agoat issacrificed tothedeceased, and
wishes offered forhissafejourney, such as"Mayyou

Itwould certainly appear asifthedeadwere cog-

"Asgrass cannot grow inthesky, sothedead cannot

might beinferred that thedead arenotcognizant of
what istaking place intheworld, oratallevents do
notknowwhat isoccurring till itismadeknown to
themthrough themedium ofsacrifice, and several
folk-lore tales point tothisconclusion aswell. The
following isanexample :


138 TEEYOEUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Awoman, aninliabitant ofaninland town, wlio
wasgoing totliesea-sbore tomake saltbyboiling
sea-water, acommon industry, andwlioexpected to
beawayfromhome forsome time, gave, ontheeve
ofherdeparture, andinthepresence ofwitnesses, a
necklace ofvaluable beads toaneighbour, tobekept
forherduring herabsence. Theneighbour, awoman
with two boys, accepted the trust, and, for safe
custody, made ahole inthemudwall ofherhouse,
intowhich sheputthenecklace, andthen closed the
aperture with fresh mud, which shesmoothed down
toconform with thewall. Unfortunately thewoman
diedbefore theowner ofthenecklace returned, and
thesecret ofitshiding-place died with her, sothat
when theowner atlastcame back andclaimed her
property, itcould notbefound.
Thewoman made agreat commotion about the
loss. Shewould notbeheve thetwochildren when
they declared thattheyhadnotseen oreven heard
ofthenecklace, andshetookthem before the chief,
andcharged them with theft. The chief heard the
case. Thefactofthenecklace having been entrusted
tothedeceased woman wasproved;theboysdeclared
thattheyknew nothing ofit,butthechief held that
they were responsible. Iftheyhadnotstolen it
theyknew where itwas. They must restore itor
paythevalue. Suchwasthechief's decision, andin
order tocompel theelder boytomake restitution, he
caused theyounger tobe"putinlog,"andthreatened
tosellhim ifthemissing property were notrecovered
within acertain time.
Inthisdilemma theelder boy,knowing thathuman

from thegods. Hewent tothehead priest ofthe

andIfareplied that inorder toknowwhat hismother

instructed himasfollows:—

When night falls inthegrove ofIfa.
"Letthechild insearch ofhismother

Then shall thedead bevisible tohim.
"Letthechild insearch ofhismother

The habalaivo instructed theboj that, upon making

Ordinarily, people donothave toundertake the
dangerous journej toDeadland inorder toconsult
thedead. When themembers ofafamily wish to
knowhow adeparted relative isfaring below, they
apply toapriest, whotakes ayoung child, bathes his
face inwater ofpurification, which, itmay be
remarked, isprepared with edible snails and shea-
butter, offers asacrifice inanewearthen vessel, digs
ahole intheearth inasacred grove inthemiddle

themagical properties ofthelustral water, the child,
onlooking down intothe hole, isable toseeinto
Deadland, andsocan tellthepriest allthat isgoing

formation herequires, heagain bathes the child's
eyeswith thewater ofpurification, which causes him
instantly tolose allrecollection ofwhat hehasseen
and heard. The priest thus remains the sole
possessor oftheinformation, andhe isable totell
thefamily thatemployed himwhat hepleases.


CHAPTER YIII.
MEASIJEEMENTS OETIME.
TheYorubas reckon timebymoons andweeks. A
moon, ormontb, istlieperiod oftimebetween one
newmoon and tlienext, and, asistliecase witli all
peoples wlio count bylunar months, tliedaycom-
mences atsunset, tliat isattlieliour atwMcli anew
moon would ordinarily befirstperceived.
Thecustom ofmeasuring timebylunar months
appears tobecommon toalluncivilised peoples, the
regular recurrence oftliemoon atfixed mtervals^ of
time affording anatural andeasymode ofcomputmg
itslapse. Tliemeasurement oftimebyweeks, that
isbysub-divisions ofthelunar month, seems,mthe
present state ofourknowledge ofthemodes of
measuring timeamongst thelower races, toberather
exceptional;butthesubject isonethat Jiasbeen
much neglected bytravellers, and there isbut
little information from which aconclusion maybe
drawn. ^ ^.
The Tshi-tribes oftheGold Coast have (aswas
stated inthe firstvolume ofthis series) ^^even-day
week, or,tobemore correct, theyhave divided the
lunar month, which isapproximately twenty-nme and
a-half days long, into four parts, each ofseven days


MEASUREMENTS OFTIME. 143
andabout nine hours. Hence, asbefore said,* each
weekcommences atadifferent hour oftheday,the
reason ofthisarrangement being that twenty-nine
and a-half willnotdivide exactly into halves and
quarters. The firstdayofthe firstweek ofthelunar
month commences when thenewmoon isfirstseen;
the firstdayofthesecond weekcommences some nine
hours later, andsoon.
The Ga-tribes have anexactly similar mode of
measuring time, buttheirnames forthedays ofthe
week arenotthesame asthose usedbytheTshi-
tribes. They are—
1st.Dsu. 5th. 80-ha.
2nd. Dsu-fo. 6th.Eo.
3rd. Fso. 7th.Eo-gha.
4th. ;S'o.
which, itwillbeseen,seem toconsist ofthree pairs
andanoddone,thethird day.
TheYoruba week consists offivedays, and sixofthem aresupposed tomake alunar month; but, asa
matter offact, since the firstdayofthe firstweek
always commences with theappearance ofthenew
moon, themonth really contains fiveweeks offive
days' duration, andone offour days and a-half
approximately. TheBenin-tribes totheeastaresaid
tohave asimilar method, andtheYoruba-tribes have
perhaps borrowed thefive-day week from them.
TheTshiand G-a-tribes thusaddafewhours to
eachseven-day week inorder tomake four ofthese
periods coincident with alunar month, andtheYoruba-
tribes deduct about twelve hours from thelast five-

144 THEYOnUBASPEARING PEOPLES.
dayweek inorder tomake sixoftliese periods agree
witli alunar montli. Thereason isobvious. Twenty-
nineand a-lialf will not divide, and the nearest
numbers that will aretwenty-eight and thn^ty. ihe
TshiandGa-tribes have adopted theformer asthe
inteo-er tobedivided, andconsequently havehad to
addsome hours, while theYorubas have adopted the
latter andhavehadtodeduct.
_
Wehave saidthat todivide thelunar month into
weeks appears tobeexceptional among thelower
races, butwehave some examples. TheAhantas
who inhabit thewestern portion oftheGold U)ast,
divide thelunarmonth intothree periods, twootten
days' duration, andthethird lasting tillthenextnew
moon appears, that is,forabout ninedaysanda-half.
TheSofalese ofEast Africa must havehadthesame
system, forDe Faria saysthattheydivided themonth
intothree weeks oftendays each,andthatthe first
day ofthe firstweek wasthe festival ofthenew
moon.* ^•ii £
When apeople hasprogressed sufficiently tarm
astronomical knowledge tohave adopted the solar
year asameasurement oftime, themonth, forthe
reason thatanexactnumber oflunar months willnot
make upasolar year, becomes acivil period or
calendar month, and isarbitrarily fixed atacertam
number ofdays, orsome months aremade ofone
len-th andsome ofanother. When this occurs, and
the°month isdisconnected from themoon and its
phases, itseems thattheweek-which wasproperly a
sub-division ofthelunar month, andwasnodoubt
*Astley's Collection, vol. iii.,p.397.


MEASUREMENTS OFTIME. 145
designed tomark tlie cliief phases oftliemoon— also
becomes acivilperiod, and isasub-division oftliecivil
month. The ancient Greeks hadacivilmonth of
thu'tj days, divided into three weeks, each often
days; andtheJavanese, before theseven-day week
wasadopted from theMohammedans, had acivil
week offivedays.* Theformer thusresembled the
Ahantas, andthelatter theYorabas, andnodoubt
when the Gfreeks andJavanese reckoned timeby
lunar months instead ofby civil, they, like the
Ahantas andYorubas, struck offthesuperfluous hours
from thelastsub-division ofthemonth.
Thenames ofthedays oftheYoruba week areas
follows:—
1.Aho-ojo .First day.
2.Ojo-awo.Day oftheSecret (sacred toIfa).
3.Oj0-0gun .Ogun's Day.
4.Ojo-Shango. Shango's Day.
5.Ojo-Ohatala. Obatala's Day.
Aho-ojo isaSabbath, ordayofgeneral rest. Itis
considered unlucky, andnobusiness ofimportance is
everundertaken onit.Onthisday allthetemples
areswept out,andwater, fortheuseofthegods, is
brought inprocession. Each oftheother days isa
dayofrestforthefollowers ofthegodtowhich itis
dedicated, and forthem only, Ojo-Shango being the
Sabbath oftheworshippers ofthethunder-god, and
Ojo-Ogun forthose ofthegodofiron, butAJco-Ojo isa
dayofrestfor all.Aholyday iscalled Ose (se,to
disallow), andbecause each holydayrecurs weekly,
*Raffles' "History ofJava," vol. i.p.475,


146 THEYORUBASPEAKING PEOPLES.
Oseliascome also tomean theweek offivedays, or
theperiod intervening between twoholy days.
There appears tobegood reason forsupposing that
the institution ofageneral day ofrest, notonly
among- theYorubas, but inmost, ifnot all,other
cases,maybereferred tomoon-worship. The first
dayofthefirstweek ofthelunar month isreckoned
from theappearance ofthenewmoon, andwas,we
think, amoon-festival, orholyday sacred tothe
moon. Thisholy day,before theinvention ofweeks,
recurred monthly, butafter thelunarmonth wassub-
divided, itrecurred weekly, andwasheldonthe first
day oftheweek. TheMendis oftheliinterland of
Sierra Leone, whoreckon timebylunar months, but
have notdivided themonth intoweeks, hold, anew-
moon festival, andabstain from allwork onthedayof
thenewmoon, alleging that ifthey infringed this
rulecornand ricewould grow red,thenewmoon
being a"dayofblood." From thiswemayperhaps
infer that itwasatonetimecustomary toofferhuman
sacrifices tothenewmoon. TheBechuanas ofSouth
Africa keep thetwenty-four hours, from theevening
onwhich thenewmoon appears tillthenext evening,
asaday ofrest, and refrain from going totheir
gardens.* These areexamples ofmonthly moon-
Sabbaths observed bypeoples who donotreckon by
weeks.
The firstday oftheTshi week, which inthe first
week ofthelunarmonth isthedayofthenewmoon,
iscalled Byo-da {Adjwo-da) "Day ofRest," and isa
*Livingstonp, "Travels inSoutli Africa," p235.


MEASUltEMENTS OFTIME. U7
general dajofrest. Theother days oftheweek are,
aswith theYorubas, dajs ofrest also,butonly for
particular persons, andnotforthewhole community.
Thesecond day, Bna-cla, issacred tothesea-gods,
and isthefisherman's Sabbath ;while the fifth day,'
Fi-da, istheSabbath ofagriculturists. The firstday
oftheG-aweek, which isalsoageneral day ofrest,
iscalled Dsu, "Purification." Dsiiseems also tohave
been used asatitle ofthemoon, forwefind silver
called dsu-etei, "moon substance," or"moonstone,"
and inthecognate EweandYoruba languages, the
moon iscalled Dsu-nu andOshu respectively. Owing
tolater andmore anthropomorphic conceptions of
godsmoon-worship appears tohave died out,though
allthese peoples salute thenewmoon respectfully
when itisfirst seen,andaTshi epithet ofthemoon
isholmim, "Sacred," or"God." When, however,
moon-worship flourished, themoon would undoubt-
edlyhavebeen ageneral god,worshipped bythecom-
munity asawhole; andhence thedaydedicated tothe
moon isageneral dayofrest,and not, liketheother
days oftheweek, aday ofrest forcertain persons
only. Inthecase oftheTshiandGatribes, wethus
have examples ofaweekly moon- Sabbath, observed
bypeoples whoreckon byweeks.
Itseems probable thattheJewish Sabbath wasalso
connected primarily withmoon-worship, and atfirst
was amonthly festival likethat oftheMendis and
Bechuanas, butbecame aweekly festival after the
Jews adopted theseven-day week from theBaby-
lonians. Inthehistorical books oftheOld Testa-
ment, viz.,Joshua, Judges, thebooks ofSamuel, and

thefirstbook ofKings, tliere isnotonlynomention
ofaweekly Sabbatk, whicli isfirst spoken ofm
II.Kings iv.23,butthere isevidence tliat sucli an
institution wasunknown; for tlieencompassing of
Jericho,* theevents described inI.Samuel xxix. and
XXX., andSolomon's fourteen-day feast,t would all
have violated theinjunction,"Letnomangooutof
hisplace ontheseventh day,"t hadthere been a
weekly Sabbath. Butwhile theweekly Sabbath is
notmentioned wefindanewmoon festival spoken
of.§ Inallthe later works, written after contact
with theBabylonians, wefindfrequent mention of
Sabbaths, butnearly always inconnection withnew
moons, andtheday ofthenewmoon was itself
observed asaday ofrest, orSabbath.||That the
Jewish Sabbath should come tobecalled theseventh
day,though originally thedayofthenewmoon, and
consequently the firstdayofthelunar month, canbe
readily understood. When aholydayrecurs every
seventh day,thedayonwhich itisheld isnaturally
called theseventh day. Thus thedayoftheYoruba
Sabbath, which recurs every fifth day, iscalled the
fifth day oftheweek, though themeaning ofthe
name alco-ojo isfirst day.
That, onadaydedicated toagod,nomanner of
work should bedonebythefollowers ofthat god,
seems tobeacustom ofuniversal appHcation. Ab-
stention fromworkwasdoubtless considered amode

ofsliowing respect for tliegod,and since awant of
respect foragodwould becommonly belie'/ed tobe
followed bjsome punishment inflicted byhim, the
proposition that itisunlucky todowork onaholy
daynaturally becomes accepted. Thus theYorubas
consider itunlucky foranyone towork onthe aJco-ojo,
orgeneral Sabbath, andforthefollowers ofthegods
towhom theother days arededicated towork on
those days. Forafollower ofagod toviolate the
daysacred tothatgod isasserious offence among the
Tshi, Ga,Ewe, andYoruba tribes, astobreak the
Sabbath wasamong theJews;and, aswith theJews,
ISpunished with death, thenotion being that ifthe
honour ofthegod isnotvindicated byhisfollowers,
they will suffer fortheneglect. TheSabbath-breaker
IS,mfact, killed bytheother worshippers ofthegod
from motives ofself-protection. OntheGold Coast
anyfisherman whodared toputtoseaonBna-da, the
fisherman's Sabbath, would inevitably, intheolddays,
havebeenputtodeath. Persons whowere not fish-
ermen, andwho consequently were notfollowers of
thegods ofthesea,might doasthey pleased ;forin
that spirit oftoleration which always accompanies
polytheism, theywere held tobeonlyaccountable to
theirowngods.
Among theYoruba tribes markets areheld weekly,
that is,every fifth day. Thedayofthemarket variesmdifferent townships, but itisnever heldonthe aJco-
ojo.From thiscustom ofholding markets every fifth
dayhas arisen another mode ofcomputing time,
namely, byperiods ofseventeen days, called eta-di-

CEREMONIES ATBIRTH, MARRIAGE, ANDDEATH.
I.AtBirth.
Theceremonies atbirtli resemble intliemain tliose
observed bytlieEwe-speaking peoples, anddescribed
inthelastvolume, buttbere areafewchanges whicli
maybeattributed toincreased priestly influence.
Assoon asthepangs oflabour seize awoman a
priestess takes charge ofher,andhasthecare of
herandthe child; while, soon after thechild is
born, ahabalawo appears onthescene toascertain
what ancestral soulhasbeen re-born intheinfant.
Assoon asthis important point isdecided, the
parents areinformed that thechild must conform
inallrespects tothemanner oflifeoftheancestor
whonowanimates it;and if,asoften happens, they
profess ignorance, thehabalawo supplies thenecessary
knowledge.
Seven days after birth, ifthechild beagirl,nine
days, ifitbeaboy, thehabalatvo comes again and
offers asacrifice ofacock and ahen toIfaand
theOlori, orindwelling spirit ofthechild's head;
after which, inorder toprevent Elegba from inter-
fering with themother and child, theentrails ofthe


CEREMONIES ATBIRTH, MARRIA GE,ANDDEATIL 153
two sacrifices aresprinkled with palm-wine, taken
outside thehouse, andplaced before hisimage.
Then follows aceremony which appears tobeone
ofpurification, forhere, asamong theTshiandEwe
tribes, themother and child areconsidered unclean,
asarewomen during themenses. Thewater which
isalways intheearthen vessels placed before the
images ofthegods, isbrought tothehouse and
thrown uponthethatched roof, and asitdrips
down from theeaves themother and child pass
three times through thefalling drops. Thehabalawo
nextmakes awater ofpurification with which he
bathes thechild's head, herepeats three times the
name bywhich theinfant istobeknown, andthen
holds him inhisarms sothat hisfeettouch the
ground. After these ceremonies have been duly
performed the fire isextinguished andtheembers
carried away;thehouse isthen carefully swept out,
live coals arebrought, andafresh firelighted. We
thusappear tohave acombination ofapurification
bywater andapurification byfire. After thenew
firehasbeen kindled, another sacrifice offowls is
made toIfa,andtheproceedings areatanend.
II.AtMaeriage.
When aman desires tomarry agirl, hisparents
visit herparents andmake proposals ofmarriage.
Ifthey areaccepted, thesuitor sends apresent of
native cloths and kola-nuts, and, after consulting a
habalawo, aday isappointed fortheweddino-.


354 THEYOIUJBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
The marriage-feast isheld atthehouse ofthe
parents ofthebridegroom, and thebride iscon-
ducted there byaprocession ofwomen, who sing
anepithalamium. The bride isput tobedbya
female ofthebridegroom's family, who remains
concealed intheapartment tillthebridegroom has
joined thebride ;afterwhich shesecures the"tokens
ofvirginity," and,coming outoftheroom, displays
them totheassembled company. Shethen carries
them tothehouse oftheparents ofthebride,who
never attend adaughter's wedding-feast, andnext
morning they arehung onthefence fortheedifica-
tion ofthepublic. Inthisabstention ofthebride's
parents from the feasting andmerrymaking, we
perhaps findalingering survival from marriage by
capture. Theproducer ofthe"tokens "isselected
from thefamily ofthebridegroom toensure that
there isnodeception, because thehusband's family
hasnointerest infalsifying the facts, while the
wife's family has ;butvirginity inabride isonly
ofparamount importance when the girlhasbeen
betrothed inchildhood. Themarriage-feast iscon-
tinued onthenext day.
Itisnotuncommon fornewly-married couples
tovisitsome celebrated shrine and offer sacrifice
together, apractice which, together with thefixing
ofthewedding-day byahabalaioo, shows anin-
creasing disposition onthepart ofthepriests to
control orinterfere with matters which arepurely
social andquitebeyond thedomain ofreligion.


CEREMONIES ATBIRTH, MARlilAGE, ANDDEATH. 155
III.AtDeath.
THeceremonies observed bytheYoruba tribes at
death chiefly differ from those oftheEwe tribes in
theaddition ofvarious religious observances.
When thebreath hasdeparted from thebody there
istheusual outburst ofexaggerated grief, with loud
cries, lamentations, and frenzied gestures, andthe
eldest sonofthedeceased, orthebrother, ifthere be
noson, atonce sends forabahalawo, toascertain if
thedeceased diedfrom natural causes, orthrough the
machinations ofwitches. The hahalaivo, after sacri-
ficing afowl, inquires attheoracle ofIfa,bymeans
oftheboard andsixteen palm-nuts ;and ifitaflSrms
that thedeath wascaused bywitchcraft, further
mquiry ismade toknow ifanyothermember ofthe
family isthreatened with alike fate,and also ifthe
soul ofthedeceased isindanger offurther molesta-
tionfrom theevil spirits whohave been influenced
bythemalpractices ofthe sorcerers. Should the
oracle declare that thesoul ofthedeceased isin
danger, asheep orgoat issacrificed, andthecarcass,
sprinkled with palm-oil, iscarried outside thetown,
anddeposited ataspotwhere two ormore paths
meet, which hastheeffect ofcausing theevil spirits
todisperse inasmany directions asthere arepaths.
ThehahalaiDO then prepares theusual water ofpuri-
fication with shea-butter andedible snails, and dip-
ping into thevessel apalm-branch, sacred toIfa,
sprinkles thecorpse, theroom, andthespectators
with thefluid. Atthesame timeheinvokes thesoul

oftliedeceased toleave theliouse assoon astlie
funeral rites liavebeen performed, andproceed peace-
fully toitsdestination, wishing itasafejourney. He
says,"May tlieroad beopen toyou.May nothing
evilmeet youontheway.Mayyou findtheroad
goodwhen yougoinpeace."
After these preliminaries, thecorpse iswashed with
rum, oradecoction ofaromatic herbs, andattired in
itsbest clothes. Thethumbs andthegreat toes are
then tiedtogether. Ifthedeceased beaman the
head isshaved, andthehair, carefully wrapped upin
apiece ofwhite cotton, isburied intheearth behind
thehouse. Ifawoman, theexposed parts ofthe
body arestained with adecoction ofthebark ofa
tree,which gives areddish huetotheskin. Tinally,
thecorpse iswrapped upinmany native cloths, and
placed onamatatthedoor oftheroom.
Inthemeantime adeath-feast hasbeen prepared,
andnowcommences, while outside thehouse acon-
tinual beating ofdrums iskept up,together with
frequent discharges ofmusketry, fired inhonour of
thedeceased. The feast, atwhich intoxicants are
used lavishly, soonbecomes averitable orgie, inwhich,
however, thechief mourners, that is,thewidows and
daughters ofthedeceased, takenopart ;forassoon
astheyhave performed thelast offices forthedead,
andhave placed thecorpse atthedoor, they areshut
upinanadjacent apartment, where they arecom-
pelled bycustom toremain during thethree days

twenty-four lioiirs, after wliicli tliey usually allow
tliemselves tobepersuaded totakesome nourisliment.
Theconventional mo,urning istliebusiness ofthe
women ofthehousehold, who, while themen are
feasting, utter loudlamentations intheroom inwhich
they areconfined;and, inconsequence ofthis, the
epithet isohun, "amourner," isoften applied toa
female child ;amale, ontheother hand, being some-
times called kvale, "adigger," i.e., ofagrave.A
father might thus saythat hehadbegotten two
mourners andadigger, meaning twodaughters anda
son. Female friends usually come tojoin inthe
lamentations, theconventional character ofwhich is
referred tointheproverb "Amourner mourns and
goesonherway(without afterthought), butonewho
ponders oversadmemories mourns without ceasing."
There arealsoprofessional mourners, chosen fortheir
poetical turn ofexpression, whose services areen-
gaged inwell-to-do households, andwho often con-
trive toworkuptherealmourners toacondition of
frenzied grief.Aprofessional mourner sings inasad
tone,which rises,and falls inamodulated wail ;"He
isgone, thelionofaman. Hewasnotasapling, or
abush, tobetornoutoftheearth, butatree—atree
tobrave thehurricane ;aspreading tree,under which
thehearts ofhisfamily could restinpeace," &c.&c.;
while thewidows anddaughters lament their lonely
andimprotected state, somewhat asfollows :—
"Igotothemarket ;itiscrowded. There are
many people there, butheisnotamong them. I
wait, buthecomes not.Ahme !Iamalone.
"Never more shall Iseehim. Itisover ;heis

"Igointo tliestreet. Thepeople pass, butheis

Iamalone.
"Alas !Iamalone. Alone intheday—alone in
thedarkness ofthenight. Alas !myfather (orhus-
band) isdead. Who willtake care ofme?"
Ontheafternoon ofthethird dayofthewake the
body isplaced onsome boards, oronadoortaken off
itshinges, covered with arich native cloth, and
borne atatrotthrough thestreets bythemen. Male
friends and relations accompany thebier, singing the
praises ofthedeceased, andthrowing handfuls of
cowries among the spectators. This procession re-
turns tothehouse towards evening, andthecorpse is
then interred inagrave that hasbeendug inthe
earthen floor, andwhich issocontrived thatthehead
ofthedeceased may project beyond the line ofthe
outer wall ofthehouse. Most ofthecloths inwhich
thecorpse iswrapped aretaken off,andthebody,
covered with grass mats sothatnoearthmay soil it,
iscarefully lowered intothegrave.Acoffin issome-
times used, butnotoften. Food, rum, andcowries
areplaced inthegrave, thebody issprinkled with
theblood ofahe-goat, sacrificed topropitiate Blegba,
afewmore cowries arethrown in,andthen thegrave
isfilled upamid thewishes forasafeandpleasant
journey towhich wehave already referred.*
When thegrave isfulltheearth issmoothed down,

andsometimes, wlienmany articles ofvalue liavebeen
entombed, the surface ismoistened with, water to
make theearth settle down, and slaves anddepen-
dents aremade tosleep onitnight after night, for
thedouble purpose ofjDrotecting itand ofobliter-
atiDg alltrace ofitsexact position. After theinter-
ment, thefeast, which hadbeen suspended since the
afternoon, recommences ;anddrinking andshouting,
amid the firing ofmuskets, thejangle ofnative
gongs, andthedullthud ofthedrums, continues all
night.
Next day,about noon, themale relations walk out
inabody, andwander about thetown, asiflooking
forthedeceased, andchanting "Welook forour
father, andcannot findhim"; towhich thebystanders
reply, "Hehasgone tohishouse." Returning from
this,themourners carry onthefeast tilltheevening
ofthenext day,when thebones ofthevictims that
havebeen sacrificed, andthose ofthefowls andsheep
thathave been eatenbytheguests, arecollected and
placed over thegrave. Allthe articles which the
deceased had indaily use,such ashispipe, themat
onwhich heslept, theplate orvessel fromwhich he
ate,hiscalabashes, andother things ofsmall value,
arecarried outintothebushandburned.
Uptothispoint thesoul ofthedeceased issup-
posed tohave been lingering near hisoldhome, and
thisdestruction ofhisproperty isintended tosignify
tothesoulthathemustnow depart, since there isno
longer anything belonging tohim. Informer times
thedestruction ofproperty wascarried much further
than atpresent. Usually theapartment inwhich


160 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
tliedeceased isburied isclosed, andnever used again,
andsometimes tlieroof isremoved. Eicli families
evenabandon tlieliouse altogether, and itissaidto
have been usual indaysbygone toburn it. Tlie
deceased iscalled tliree times byname, andadjured
todepart, andnolonger haunt thedwellings ofthe
living. After this invitation tobegone, thefowl,
called adire-iranna* issacrificed, which, besides se-
curing aright-of-way forthe soul, issupposed also
toguide it.The feathers ofthefowl arescattered
around thehouse, andthebird itself carried outtoa
bush-road, where itiscooked and eaten. Theroad
onwhich theaclire-iranna iseatenmust beoutside the
town andleadaway from it,forthough thenatives
believe thatDeadland isunder theearth, theythink
that itisnecessary toeatthefowlonaroad leading
intothebush, inorder toplace itinaproper position
forcommencing itsofiice ofguide tothesoul.
The relations may notwash themselves orcomb
their hair during thefuneral ceremonies, inconse-
quence ofwhich the rites themselves aresometimes
styled Ofo,"Unwashed." Onthelastdaytheyshave
their heads, andthen pay visits ofthanks tothose
who assisted atthefuneral. Thetime ofmourning
after theconclusion ofthese ceremonies varies with
therank andinfluence ofthedeceased, andwith the
locality. Three months isusually considered long
enough, butacommemoration-feast isoften held a
year after thedeath. During theperiod ofmourning
thehairmust beleftunkempt asitgrows, andwomen

must cover theliead witli acloth ofadark blue
colour. Awidow remains shutupforforty days,and
maynotwash hercloths during that time.
Itisconsidered thegreatest disgrace toafamily
nottobeable tohold theproper ceremonies atthe
death ofoneoftheir number, anotion which iscom-
prehensible whenweremember howmuch thewelfare
ofthesoul ofthedeceased issupposed todepend
upon their performance. Hence families notun-
frequently reduce themselves almost tobeggary in
order tocarrythem out,orpawn orselltheir children
toraise themoney necessary. Sometimes, too,they
conceal thedeath andhide thebody until theyhave
secured therequisite means, andsuch concealments
have beenknown tolastforthree orfourmonths.
Thebody istreated with resinous herbs sothat it
becomes desiccated, and,while itremains inthehouse,
thesoul isbelieved toabide initsoldhome, where
foodanddrink areprovided for it,tillsuch time as
theproper ceremonies canbeheld,and itbeleg-iti-
mately ushered onitsnew career.
Acommon imprecation is01m igbe, "Bush
death," meaning "May you dieinthebush, alone
anduncared for,and soreceive nofuneral-rites."Aproverb contrasts aman's duties tohisrelations
with those towards themembers ofanysecret society
towhich hemay belong, such astheOgboni, and
msists upon theimportance oftheformer, because
oftheobligation upon hisrelations tobury him.
Itruns, "Amanmust honestly perform alltheduties
mcumbent onrelationship, eventhough hemaybelong

society liemust attend tohisrelations, because itis
theJwhomustbnryhimwhen hedies."
This desire foravery ceremonial funeral, which
•owes itsorigin tothenative beliefs concerning the
soul, lastslong after thenegro hasbeen transplanted
across theAtlantic, andhas lost allnotion ofits
motive. Inmost oftheWest India Islands, but
particularly intheBahamas, where thebulk ofthe
negro population isofYoruba descent, agrand
funeral isconsidered thegreatest desideratum. To
attain this end, burial-societies areformed, the
members ofwhich paysubscriptions alltheir lives
inorder tobeburied withpomp. Every member
ofsuch asociety isbound toattend thefuneral of
another member, andthe result isaprocession of
men inuniforms, more orless grotesque, with
banners andvarious insignia. Often aband heads
the cortege, andmany aman occupies his last
moments ingiving directions astothemanner in
which thefuneral istotake place.*

CHAPTER X.
SYSTEM OEGOVEENMENT.
The monarcliical system ofgovernment prevailsm
most oftheYoruba tribes, bnt tlieking ismerely
tlienominal liead oftlie state, and lias little real
power, wliicli remains inthehands ofthe chiefs
and elders, without whom theking candonothing.
Ineach state there isacouncil ofelders, without
whose concurrence theking can issue noedict,
and atwo-thirds' majority ofwhich isrequired
foranynew law. The sovereignty ofastate is
hereditary inonefamily, buttheindividual who is
tosucceed tothe office isselected bythe council.
Themonarchy isthus elective, though onlymen
ofacertain blood-descent arequalified forelection.
The council ofelders, besides electing aking,
controls hisactions, and, should heshow any dis-
position tomake himself independent ofit,invites
him to"go tosleep," bysending himapresent of
parrots' eggs. Theking isnever allowed tosee
foreigners without some members ofthecouncil
being present, and all his actions are closely
watched. The king and thecouncil make laws
and decide allordinary affairs, but, should any
question ofvital importance tothenation arise,


SYSTEM OFGOVERNMENT.1G5
thewhole people isassembled for itsdiscussion
andsettlement;andevery individual, regardless of
position, isallowed toexpress hisopinion. Theemblem ofroyalty isaconical head-dress ofbeads,
from which hang long strings ofbeads, soarranged
astoconceal theface ofthewearer. Anepithet
applied tokings isalaiye, "Owner oftheWorld."
The election ofaking ispreceded byacurious
ceremony. When the council has selected the
mdividual who istosucceed tothe throne, the
chiefs and elders proceed tohishouse ontheday
fixed forthecoronation, seize him suddenly, and
forcibly convey him tothepalace, where they floo-himvigorously with light whips. Ifheshould cryoutduring thepunishment, orshow any signs ofpam, heisatonce rejected asunworthy, andthe
council makes anew choice;but ifhebearhimself
bravely, without flinching, heisforthwith crowned.
This^ ordeal appears tobedesigned totest the
candidate's capacity forendurance, and hispowersofself-restraint andconcealment ofthought. Anexactly similar practice isfound among theTimnis
ofSierra Leone, who, ontheday ofelection, scoff
atandbeat thenewking while dragging himfrom
hisownhouse totheresidence ofhispredecessor•
where, ifhehaswithstood the ordeal, theroyalornaments areputonhim.
The chief officers ofstate aretheBashorun, orprime minister, thechief adviser ofthekino-whohasthe title ofEmeiva (Eni-mo-ewa), "Hewhoknows themind;" andtheBalog^m (Oha-ni-ogun),
or"Chief oftheArmy." The military officer

second incommand, isstyled the Berild. Next to
these high officials come the civil governors of
towns {Bale *),each ofwhom exercises rule inhis
own domain. The Bales oftowns correspond to
the chiefs ofdistricts among theTshi tribes, and,
asintheir case, theking ofthenation isthe
Bale ofhisown capital. Under theBales of
towns aretheBales oftown -quarters and villages,
andunder these again aretheBales ofhouseholds.
The Bale ofahousehold isresponsible forthe
preservation oforder inthegroup ofdwellings
occupied bjhisfamily anddependents. Hesettles
allminor disputes between those under hiscontrol,
but ifthematter involves thesubordinates ofanother
household-5aZe, itistaken before theBale ofthe
town-quarter, who isresponsible forpeace andorder
within that area. Ifitbeanordinary "palaver,"
thisfunctionary settles it,but ifitbeserious hemust
refer ittotheBale ofthetown. Unless the affair
concerns another district also, orisofnational im-
portance, itneed gonofurther, forinhisown
domain thetown-5aZe isalmost independent. Persons
subject toaBale address him asBaba, "Father," or
"Master," andheinturn callsthem "mychildren."
Inevery town there is,besides theBale, anlyalode
(lya-ni-ode), "Mistress ofthe street," towhom all
disputes between women arebrought inthe first
instance, onlythose which she isunable todeal with
being referred tothe Bale. The lyalode has as
coadjutors anOton-iyalode (right-hand lyalode) and
anOsin-iyalode (left-hand lyalode).

Members ofcouncil andtown-Bales are Oloris,
"chiefs," andform thearistocracy. Every Olori has
inhisservice certain mentermed Onses, who actas
messengers, heralds, bailiffs, and police, and, ata
pinch, asexecutioners. Aking's Onse iscalled an
Ilari, whence theproverb, "As nosubject, however
rich,mayhaveanIlari, soitisnoteverymanwho
mayownapalace."
Respect tokings andchiefs isshown byprostration,
followed byrising andclapping thehands. Before
entering thepresence ofaking orchief, thecloth
isremoved from theshoulder, overwhich itisusually
worn, andwrapped round thewaist. When anew
title isconferred onamanaleaf oftheaJcolco-tree is
given totherecipient asasign ofhonour. All
officers ofstate,members ofcouncil, andtown-Bales
h&ye EJcejis, "seconds," who assist inthemanagement
ofaffairs andrule intheabsence oftheir principals.
Theking alsohasanEJceji, and itishewho isusually
selected tosucceed him.
Theforegoing applies generally toalltheYoruba
tribes, butthere areafewcustoms special tocertain
kingdoms, which itmaybeaswell tonote.
InYoruba proper theking isstyled theAlafin,
andhiseldest son, called theAremo (Are-ommo, eldest
child), governs conjointly with him. Under anold
custom, theAremo was obliged tocommit suicide
when theAlafin died ;andthenewking,whomust be
thedescendant ofonewhohadworn thecrown, was
chosen from another branch oftheroyal family.
Thiscustom was setatdefiance byAdelu, whowas

rebelled. Thecustom hasnotsince been observed.
The tailofawhite-bellied rat, called Afe-imojo (Rat
ofknowledge), isused.bytheAlafin asthesymbol of
royalty, andwhen hewalks abroad heholds ittohis
lips.
InYoruba the office ofBasliorun ishereditary in
one family, butthe Alafin, incouncil, selects the
member tofill it.Heisobliged bylaw toreside in
Oyo, thecapital. Next inrank totheBasliorun is
theAre-Onalcalanfo, "First oftheWar- Captains,"
whocanbeselected fromanyfamily and livewhere
hepleases. The council consists oftwenty-two
members, and iscalled Isolcan (agreement, concord,
orunanimity) ;theleader ofthecouncil isstyled the
Onasohan,"Channel totheConcord."
TheBaris arethe confidential advisers ofthe
Alafin, andareofeither sex,thefemales being chosen
fromamong hiswives. Ilaris, whether male or
female, shave thehead, leaving asmall tuft, ortail,on
thecrown. Inaddition tothese, theAlafin hasa
number ofcourt-officials termed Bafin, orIbafin, a
wordwhich seems tomean "Inmates ofthePalace."
Six ofthem, called theBvefa {Iwe-eja) "the six
papers," arechamberlains, theremainder arespies, or
intelligence-officers, whokeep theAlafin informed of
everything thattakes place. The chief chamberlain
isstyled theOna-iwefa, andthetwonext inrank, the

Among allthetribes therevenues ofthekings, chiefs,
andhales oftowns arederived from tribute paidbythe
dependent villages, andfrom duties levied upon goods
andnative productions brought intothetowns. These
duties arecollected byofficers called Oni-bodes, and
arelevied atcustom-houses [bode) atthegates of

lawsandcustoms.
(1)Laws relating toKinship andInheritance.
We find agreat change from thecustoms oftlie
other tribal groups ofthisfamily ofnations, inthe
Yoruba manner oftracing descent and blood-rela-
tionship ;descent andconsanguinity being nolonger
reckoned exclusively inthefemale line,with succes-
siontochiefdom, office, andproperty from brother to
brother, andthen tosister's son ;butinthemale line,
asfarassuccession todignities isconcerned, andon
both sides ofthehouse forblood-descent. The
Yoruba family—using theword family asmeaning a
group ofpersons whoareunited byties ofblood—is
thus quite adifferent organisation tothatwhichwe
found existing among theTshiandEwe tribes, where
afamily consists solely ofpersons who areconnected
byuterine ties,and inwhich, astwopersons ofthe
same bloodmaynotmarry, thefather isnever related
byblood tohischildren, and isnotconsidered asbe-
longing tothefamily. IntheTshiandEwe tribes
theclan-name isthetest ofblood-relationship, andas
property follows thelaws ofblood-descent, itensues
thatproperty never goes outoftheclan;for,with


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 176
descent intliefemale line, afamily isonly asmall
circle ofpersons, allofwliom bear tliesame clan-
name, within thelarger circle oftheclan itself.
Among theYoruba tribes theblood-tie between
father andchild hasbeen recognised, andtheresult
ofthisrecognition hasbeen theinevitable downfall
oftheclan-system, which isonly possible solong as
descent istraced solely ononeside ofthehouse, as
may bereadily shown. Since twopersons ofthe
same clan-name may, under theclan-system, never
marry, itfollows thathusband andwifemust beof
different clans. Letussaythatone isaDogandthe
other aLeopard. Theclan-name isextended toall
who areofthesame blood;therefore, directly the
blood-relationship between father andchildcomes to
beacknowledged, thechildren ofsuch apair aswe
have supposed, instead ofbeing, asheretofore, simply
Leopards, would beDog-Leopards, andwould belong to
two clans. They intheir turnmight marry with
persons similarly belonging totwo clans, sayCat-
Snakes, and theoffsprings ofthese unions would
belong tofour clans. Theclan-system thusbecomes
altogether unworkable, because, asthenumber of
clans islimited andcannot beadded to,iftheclan
name stillremained thetestofblood-relationship and
abar tomarriage, theresult inafewgenerations
would bethatnomarriages would bepossible. Con-
sequently theclan-name ceases tobethetest ofcon-
sanguinity, kinship istraced insome other way,and
theclan-system disappears;or,asappears tohave
been occasionally thecase, descent isboldly trans-
ferred intothemale line,andmarriage inthefather's


176 TEEYOBTJBA-SFEAKING PEOPLES.
clan isprohibited, tliafc oftliemother being ignored.
TheYornbas haveadopted what appears tohavebeen
theusual course, andblood-relationship isnowtraced
bothonthefather's andonthemother's side, asfar
asitcanberemembered, andmarriage within the
known circle ofconsanguinity isforbidden.
Wlien weconsider theextraordinary vitality the
system ofdescents through mothers possesses, solong
asitisundisturbed byforeign influence, itseems
probable thattheacknowledgment ofafather's blood-
relationship tohischildren wasbrought about bythe
intercourse ofthenorthern Yorubas with theMoham-
medan tribes ofthe interior. That theYorubas
formerly hadthesystem offemale descents isshown
byanancient proverb, which says,"The esuo (gazelle),
claiming relationship with the elculu (alarge ante-
lope), says hismother wasthedaughter ofanehulu."
Ifthemale system ofdescents hadbeen invogue
when thisproverb wasinvented, theesuowould have
beenmade tosaythat hisfather wasthesonofan
elculu. Moreover, inspite ofthelegal succession from
father tosons, children bydifferent mothers, butthe
same father, arebymany natives still scarcely con-
sidered true blood-relations.
Itisnodoubt inconsequence ofthechange from
kinship inthefemale linetokinship onboth sides of
thehouse that thefamily hasbecome, toacertain
extent, disintegrated. OntheGold Coast, where the
uterine family istheonlyoneknown, thefamily is
collectively responsible forthecrimes orinjuries to
person orproperty committed byany ofitsmem-
bers,andeachmember isliable foraproportion of


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 177
tliecompensation tobepaid. Similarly, eachmember
ofthefamily isentitled toashare ofthecompensation
received forinjury totheperson orproperty ofoneof
themembers. Thehead ofthefamily can, ifthe
necessity should arise, pawn, andinsome cases sell,
ajunior member;while, ontheother hand, thejunior
members have aright tobefedandclothed bythe
head ofthefamily. Among theYoruba tribes there
isnocollective responsibility inafamily, except that
parents areresponsible forcrimes committed bytheir
children;thehead ofthefamily cannot pawn the
younger members, andthelatter cannot claim, asa
matter ofright, tobesupported byhim.
When aman dies hissons divide allhisproperty
between them. Thedaughters have noinheritance
intheir father's house, butthey divide between them
theproperty oftheir mother, forhere, aswith the
Tshi, Ga,andEwe tribes, theproperty ofawife is
always separate and distinct from that ofherhus-
band. Ifamanhavenosons hisproperty falls to
hisbrothers, or, ifhehavenobrothers, tohissisters.
From these laws ofinheritance there isnodeparture,
andamancannot disinherit alegal heir.Aman can,
within certain limits, giveaway projoerty during his
lifetime, provided itispurely personal, andnotfamily
property;buthecannot make awill, oranyarrange-
ment for itsdisposal after hisdeath. Succession to
property entails theobligation ofdefraying thedebts
ofthedeceased.
Theterms used toexpress relationship arevery
indefinite, andcanbe,and are,used notonly torela-
tions, buteven tostrangers, asterms ofaddress.

eghon, elder, senior, oraburo, younger. Thus, eghon
ara olconri would mean anelder brother ormale
cousin, properly, anelder male relative ofthesame
generation asthespeaker. Omo, child, which also
hasnogender, and requires thequalifying words
olconri orohiri tobeplaced after itwhen exactitude is
necessary, isused torelations ofthegeneration next
below thespeaker, that istosay, tosons, daughters,
nephews, nieces, andchildren ofcousins. Itisalso
used asaterm ofaddress todomestic slaves. Grand-
father, laba-la {haha-nla, great-father) isused togrand-
fathers and great-uncles, and iya-la {iya-nla, great-
mother) tomothers andgreat-aunts. Grandchild is
omO'Omo (child-child), oromo-loju (front-child).
Theforegoing aretheterms commonly used. Of
course itisquite possible toconstruct compound
terms toexpress exactly thedegree ofrelationship,
justaswecan, ifrequired, say,"father's sister," in-


LAWSANDGU8T0MS.I79
Stead of"aunt," or"father's brotlier's son," instead
of"cousin ";but tlieYorubas donotmake useof
sucliterms anymore thanwedo.Tlius "aunt" could
beexpressed bjara-hiri tihaha, orara-biri tiiya,
"relative ofsame age, female, ofthefather," or
relative ofsame age, female, ofthemother," but
iya isalways used instead.

Thissystem iswhat the lateMr.Morgan termed
theclassificatory system ofrelationships, and,onthe
assumption thattheterms usedwere from their very
inception devised toexpress actual degrees ofblood-
relationship, heendeavoured toshow that thehuman
family hadpassed through regular stages ofpeculiar
types ofmarriage.* But itappears certain that
these terms were originally terms ofaddress topersons
ofdifferent grades, being probably designed toshow
therelative positions oftheindividuals composing
thegroup orcommunity, andhadnothing whatever
todowith consanguinity. AstheYorubas trace
descent onboth sides ofthe house, they might,
assuming thattheterms didimply blood-relationship,
veryproperly usetheterm foramale ofthegenera-
tionnext above thespeaker, either tothe father's

ourselves say"uncle"
;buttheTshiandGatribes,
whotrace descent solely through themother, equally
have this classificatory system, andalsouseoneand
thesameterm torelations onthefather's sideoron
themother's. That istosay, these tribes usethese
terms indifferently toblood-relations and topersons
who, according totheir system ofconsangumity,
arenotrelations atall ;andtheconclusion isthat
theterms oftheclassificatory system donotprimarily
imply consanguinity, whatever theymaycome to
mean afterwards.
The lack ofprecision intheterms usedbythe
Yorubas toexpress relationships would atfirst sight
seem toshow that they,andother raceswho follow
theclassificatory system, donotlaymuch stress upon
blood-relationship, themore especially asthey use
thesame terms both toconsanguinei and topersons
who arenotakin ;butthefactappears tobethatthe
classificatory system isatfirstalways combined with
theclan-system, and astheclan-name isthetest
ofconsanguinity, precision interms ofaddress isnot
really ofmuch moment. After theclan-system breaks
down, andtheclan-name ceases tobethe test,some
other mode ofdenoting blood-relationship becomes
necessary ;and itseems probable that itisunder the
stress ofthese new circumstances that theterms
formerly applied towhole grades arenarrowed in
their application tothehousehold circle, andnew
descriptive terms, such asuncle, nephew, and cousin,
areinvented todefine theremoter degrees ofcon-
sanguinity. Inthis connection wemay note that

among tlieyounger generations oftlieYorubas tlie
word eghon, which, reallj onlymeans "elder," is
rapidly coming intouseasaterm ofaddress tothe

(2)Maeeiage Laws andCustoms.
Wives aremarried bypurcliase, theamount paid
forabride varying with therank ofthefather and
alsowith that ofthehusband, foraman ofwealth
and position isexpected togivemore forawife
than onelower inthe social scale. The poorest
always pay asmallsum fortheir wives, soasto
givetheunion thetitle ofamarriage, anddistinguish
itfrom concubinage. Theamount paid forawife
isregarded asacompensation toherparents for
the loss ofher services inthehousehold, andthe
transaction isnotinanysense thepurchase ofa
chattel.
Bymarriage aman acquires theservices ofhis
wife indomestic affairs andanexclusive right to
herembraces. That is,shemaynothave intercourse
with othermenwithout hisknowledge andconsent,
butthere isnoobjection tohiswaiving hisright
infavour ofsome other person, andmensometimes
lend their wives totheir guests orfriends, though
more frequently their concubines, forinahousehold
there areboth wives and concubines, the latter
usually being slaves. Each wifehasherownhouse,
situated inthe"compound "ofthehusband, and
herown slaves anddependants. The wife first
married isthehead wife, and ischarged with the
preservation oforder among thewomen. She is

stjled lyale (lya He), "Mistress of tliehouse."
Thejunior wives arecalled lyawo (lyaowo), "Trade-
wives," or"Wives ofcommerce," probably because

Grirls ofthe better classes arealmost always
betrothed when mere children, frequently when
infants, thehusband mfuturo being sometimes a
grown manandsometimes aboy. Betrothal con-
fersupon themale allthe rights ofmarriage
except consummation, which takes place shortly
after thegirl arrives atpuberty. Since theearly
age ofbetrothal makes ante-betrothal unchastity a
physical impossibility, theabsence oftheprimitise
when themarriage isconsummated proves that the
girlhasbeen unchaste after betrothal, that is,after
thehusband infuturo hadacquired anexclusive right
toherperson, andconsequently hehasaright to
repudiate her. Insuch acasehemaydismiss her,
sending afewbroken cowries tohermother, andthe
girl's family must return theamount paid forher,
andthevalue ofallpresents made ;but itismore
usual toeffect some compromise.
In thiscustom ofinfant orchild-betrothals we
probably find thekey tothat curious regard for
ante-nuptial chastity found not onlyamong the
tribes ofthe G-old and Slave Coasts, but also
among many other uncivilised peoples indifferent
parts oftheworld ;andwhich certainly cannot be
attributed toanyfeeling ofdelicacy, since husbands
lend their wives without theleast compunction, and
often merely asasign offriendliness. In"West
Africa virginity inabride isnotvalued j?er se,but


184 THEYOBUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
because itisaproof that thebetrothed hasnotin-
fringed theexclusive marital i^rivileges ofthehusband
infuturo ;andnon-virginity inabride isonly a
valid ground forrepudiation when the girlhasbeen
betrothed atatender age,forunbetrothed girlscan
bestow their favours uponwhom they please. Thus,
nomanwho marries agirlwithout early betrothal
feelsaggrieved ifsheshould prove nottobeavirgin,
foruntil she ismarried orbetrothed she isperfectly
free,andmistress ofherown actions.
G-irls ofthelower classes, whoareseldom betrothed,
canleadany lifethey choose without incurring re-
proach, andwithout affecting their future prospects
ofmarriage ;but girls oftheupper classes, whoare
almost always betrothed, must bechaste. If,then,
thegreat majority ofgirlswere betrothed inchild-
hood, itmay readily beconceived that anotion might
beformed thatabride ought tobeavirgin, andbe
made ofgeneral application quite independent of
betrothals. Atpresent, thefeeling ofannoyance,
which aYoruba bridegroom experiences when hefinds
that hisbride hasbeen unchaste, isnotduetojealousy
orsentiment, buttoasense ofinjury, because his
rights acquired bybetrothal have been trespassed
upon; butnodoubt, incourse oftime, thesentimental
grievance would beproduced. Whether this feeling
everextends tothelowest classes isuncertain, butat
allevents ithasscarcely yetdone soinEurope.
Agreat deal ofevidence might beadduced toshow
that thecustom ofchild-betrothal leads tovirginity
being expected inabride, and itsabsence being
reo-arded asajustground forrepudiation. InNew


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 185
Zealand, girlswere occasionally betrothed ininfancy,
and inthat casehad tobechaste ;but girls not
betrothed inchildhood were allowed, ongrowing up,
tobestow their favours onwhom they pleased.* In
FijiandSamoa itappears that onlythedaughters of
chiefs wereexpected tobevirgins when married, and
itwasonly thedaughters ofchiefs whowere be-
trothed early inlife.f TheMosquito Indians betroth
children, and if,when themarriage takes place, the
girl isnotavirgin, thematch isbroken off. Similar
evidence isforthcoming inregard totheBagas, Fulas,
Timnis, andFans, inAfrica, theKirghese andOuz-
beks, inAsia,andmany others.
Parents cannot force adaughter tomarry asuitor
who isdistasteful toher,buttheycanprevent agirl
frommarrying aman ofwhom theydonotapprove,

girlshave lovers insecret.

(3)Land Laws.
Land belongs tothecommunity collectively, and is
vested inthe chief, who distributes itamongst
households and families asrequired. Noman can
bedispossessed oflandonce allotted tohim,andthe
usufruct descends tohischildren, buttheland cannot
besold. Thelandbeing more than sufficient for all
requirements, thiscommunal system presents no
difficulties, aspractically everybody canhave asmuch


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 189
asliewishes tocultivate. Wlien laud goes outof
cultivation, and isallowed tobeovergrown withbush
orforest, itreverts tothecommunity.
OntheGold Coast private property inland isnot
recognised, andthesaleorpurchase ofland isun-
known, except when Europeans orAnglicised natives
desire toacquire landed property, inwhich case
theconsent ofthecommunity asawhole tothe
transaction has tobeobtained. Among theYoruba
tribes, however, thenotion that land,andnotmerely
itsusufruct, maybetheproperty oftheindividual,
instead ofthecommunity, isbeginning toappear,
forachief can sellorgiveaway land. Noonebuta
chief can sellland ;itisone oftheprerogatives of
chieftainship ;buttheland soldorgiven away must
beunoccupied waste-land, theusufruct ofwhich has
notbeen yielded toanymember ofthecommunity.
When, under thiscustom, land isgiven, theowner-
ship isnotcomplete, forthough theindividual or
family which receives itcanretain itanduse itfor
ever, itcannot bedisposed oftoanythird party.
Land acquired bypurchase becomes theabsolute
property ofthepurchaser. Thepurchase ofland
does not,however, carry with ittheownership of
anything ontheland, such astrees, crops, orhouses,
which stillremain theproperty ofthevendor, unless

(4)Laws ofDebt.
Amancanbeimprisoned fordebt, and inevery
town ofimportance there isadebtor's prison {Ile-
emu, bouse ofseizure), inwbicb tbeBale confines
adebtor tilltbedebt isdischarged .There isalsoa
custom similar toourputting aman inpossession,
abailiff's ofiicer, called ogo,being placed inthe
debtor's house toenforce payment.
Amanwhocauses theordinary funeral-rites tobe
performed over another, thereby becomes responsible
for allthedebts ofthedeceased, unless hefirst
obtains permission from thecreditors. The creditors
nearly always consent upon therelations becoming
collectively responsible forthedischarge ofthedebt;
but ifthey refuse permission, andnoone iswilling
toaccept theresponsibility, thecorpse isplaced ona
raised platform ofwattles outside thetown, and
remains there tillthedebt ispaid. This seldom
occurs, except inthecase ofastranger, asthe
omission tobury reflects thegreatest disgrace upon
thefamily concerned.
Aman isresponsible foranydebts hiswivesmay
contract, butnotforthose contracted byhischildren.
(5)Criminal Laws.
When there isnot sufficient evidence toestablish
theguilt ofanaccused, hehastoprove hisinnocence by
"drinking orisha," that is,heissubjected toanordeal,

or,inother words, liuman means Having failed, thebur-
denofadecision isthrown upon thegods. Thedraught,
which isnearly always adecoction ofodtim-hark, is
prepared byapriest, whothushas itinhispower to
make itharmless oreffective. Itisapowerful poison,
and ifnotatonce rejected bythestomach, asoften
happens, causes death, inwhich case theorisha is
considered tohave declared hisguiltbyslaying him.Aguiltyman does notdare to"drink orisha;' but
theinnocent willsubmit totheordeal without fear,
and, indeed, frequently demand itinorder toprove
their innocence, whence itfollows that itisthe
guiltless whoordinarily perish.
Asarule,murder, arson, andtreason arepunished
with death.Afirst offence oftheft ispunished by
flogging andafine, asecond bymutilation, anda
third bydeath. When, however, cattle orsheep-
steahng, becomes prevalent, adetected thief isputto
death, asawarning toothers. Insuch acase, the
criminal, instead ofbeing executed bytheOgboni in
secret, isdecapitated onOgun's stool, bythesword-
bearers ofthechiefs, insome public place. Criminals
who cannot pay their fines areflogged with the
Jc^ashan, aformidable whip made ofhippopotamus-
hide,which draws blood ateach stroke.
Therelatives ofaperson whohasbeen executed
forcrime arenotentitled toburyhimwithout paying
ransom forthebody, which, asinthecase ofaman
dying indebt, isplaced onaplatform ofsticks
outside thetown, until theransom ispaid.

(1)Verhs.
(1)InYoruba, asinTshi, Ga,andEwe, allsimple
roots aremonosyllabic verbs, consisting ofaconsonant
followed byavowel. These, wliicli are tlieprimitive
verbs, wewill callverbs ofClass I.Examples :—
Ba,tomeet. Je,toeat. Wa, tocome.
Bi,tobeget. Mo, todrink. Mi,tobreathe.
Da, tomake. Lo,togo. Wo, tosee.
(2)Verbs ofClass II.areformed from Class I.,
byadding aliquid n.
Yan, togape,yawn ;from ya,toopen, part.
(3)Verbs ofClass III. areformed byusing to-
getlier twoverbs ofClass I.,wliicli are,however,
separated bytheobjective noun. They arewhatwe
styled, inEwe, "Separable Compound Verbs."
Examples:—
Ba-ja, tofight with ;from ha,tomeet, andja,tofight.
Ba-ro, toadvise; »ba,tomeet, and ro,toconsider.
Di-mo, toenclose; „di,toshut, andmo,tostop.
Gba-la, torescue; „gba, totake, and la,tosave.
Du-ro, todesist, cease;„du,tostrive, and ro,toease.

Kpeja, tofish
; „kpe, tokill,and eja, fish.
Da-meji, todivide

Bawijo, tojudge„ba,tomeet, andwijo, tocomplain.
(6)Verbs ofanother class, and wliicli may be
called "verbs ofpossession," areformed byplacing
theverb ni,tohave, before anoun. Before the
vowels a,e,0,and u,niischanged euphonically toli,
ovV. Thus:—
Ni-dagiri, tobealarmed
; from ni,andidagiri, alarm.
Ni-beru, tofearandz5mi, fear.
Ni-kpekun, toterminate ;••„ andikpekwi, end.

Negative Voice.
AsinTslii, Ga,andEwe, verbs arealsoconjugated
negatively. InYoruba tliis iseffected byplacing
thenegative particle aibefore theverb. Thus:—
Fe,tolove. Aife, nottolove.
Aiiscompounded ofa,not,andthesubstantive
formative prefix i,signifying astate ofbeing.
Thenegative particle ofaverb ofpossession islai,
which issimply ai,with theverbm,tobe,euphoni-
callychanged to I,placed before it.Example:—
Lowo (ni-owo), toberich,have wealth.
Lai-lowo, nottoberich (literally, "nottobetohavewealth ").
Many verbs denote aquality, as:—
Le,tobehard, orstrong.
Du,tobeblack.
Mo,tobeclean.
Articles.
The indefinite article isexpressed byohan (one)
being placed after thenoun. Itisalmost invariably
abbreviated toJean.
The definite article isexpressed bythedemonstra-
tivepronoun na(that), which isplaced after the
noun. Thus:—
Olconri kan,aman;literally, "oneman."
Olconri na,theman;literally, "thatman."

Tronouns.
(1)Personal pronouns.
When used inconjunction witli averb, tliepersonal
pronouns are:—
Emi, mo,orncj, I. Aioa,We.
Iioo, or0,Thou. Enyin, You.
On,orno.He,she,or it.Aioon, ornwon, They.
-Mo, I,cannot beusedwith thefuture tenses. Kg
ismorecommonly used inthefuture than emi,and is
often usedwhenever then,signifying action notjet
completed, isprefixed totheverb. Theindependent
forms ofthepersonal pronouns arethesame asthose
given first above. Thepersonal pronouns aremade
possessive bjplacing iibefore them. Tiisan
obsolete verb,nowonlyused inthesense of"of"or
"belonging to." Thus:—
Tiemi,ort'emi, Mine. Tiawa, ort'awa, Ours.
Tiiwo,ortHwo, Thine. Tienyin, ort'enyin, Yours.
Tion,ort'on, His. Tiawon, orti'ivon, Theirs.
Theobjective personal pronouns are:—
Mi,Me.T^a,Us.
Wo,or0,Thee. Nyiji, You.
A,e,i,0,oru,Him, her, it.Wo7i, Them.
Aswillbeseen, they are,with theexception ofthe
third person singular, thenominative personal pro-
nouns with theinitial vowel omitted. Theparticular
form tobeused toexpress him, her,orit,isdeter-mmed bythevowel-sound oftheverb, abeing used
with averb inwhich thesound ofaoccurs, and
soon.Thus:—
awould beusedwith theverb ba,orwith kan.
^ " J) » gc-
^ " )) SI,orwith rin.


200 THEYORUBA-SFEAKING PEOPLES.
The personal pronouns aremade reflexive by
adding ti-kara {ti, of,orbelonging to; ara,body,
form):—
Tikara 'vii,Myself. Tikara 'wa,Ourselves.
Byplacing na(thesame that) after apersonal
pronoun theparticularising power isincreased. It
denotes theexclusion ofanyother person, andanswers
to"myself," "himself," &c.:—
Emi na,Imyself. Aioa na,Weourselves.
(2)Relative pronouns.
There isonly one, viz.: ti,which means who,
whom, which, that.
Inthenominative case thepersonal pronoun to
which itrelates isalways placed after it,as
lya tiofe'mi,"themother who loves me," literally,
"the mother who sheloves me." Intheobjective
casetherelative pronoun isgoverned bytheverb, and
thepersonal pronoun isnotrequired. Thus Iija ti
emife, "themother whom Ilove."
(3)Demonstrative pronouns.
These are:—
Eyiyi, eyi,oryi,This. Wonyi, These.
Eyini, eni,ni,orna.That. Wonni, Those.
Eyiyi, eyi,oryi,seems tomean literally "thething
taken," andEyini tobecomposed ofeyi,and eni,
one. Won, isanabbreviation ofawon, they.
The adverbial demonstrative pronouns oftime,
place, andmanner areexpressed by :—
Nighana, then, atthattime {ni,tobe
;igha, time; na,that).
Niliin-yl, here, inthisplace (niha, locality, place;eyi,this).


LANGUAGE. 2(11
Nibe-na, there, inthatplace {nibe, inorataplace; na,that).
Bat, thus, inthismanner (isperhaps acontraction ofba-eyi, tomeet
this).
(4)Interrogative pronouns.
Tani,Who.
Eivo, Which.
The possessive cases aremade byprefixing ti,
"belonging to":—
Ti-tani, Ti-ewo.
Nouns.
Nouns areformed inthefollowing ways :
(1)From theverb, with theprefix i.This prefix
seems toconvey thenotion ofthings regarded collec-
tively, orintheabstract.
Ife,love, willingness, from fe,tolove.

Nini, owner,„ni,to.possess.
Riri, sight, ri,tosee.
Konrinkonrin, singer„konrin, tosing.
Gbenagbena, carpenter,„ghena, tocarve, work inwood.
(b)Irregular reduplication :—
Mimu, something tobedrunk, frommu,todrink.
TiYo, sufficiency,tobeenough.
Giga, height,tobetall.
Jija, fight, battle,ja,tofight.
Jijin, depth,y,-tobedeep.

orit)toaverb ofpossession, as:—
Onija, antagonist, fighter, from nija{niija), tohave strife,
Onijo, dancer,tohave adance.Om%o, judge„ ,v%o), tohave
judgment.
Where thenioftheverb ofpossession hasbeen
euphonically changed to li,or I,the initial vowel of
theoriginal nounbecomes theprefix ofthenonn of
possession. Thus :—
Alafose diviner, from lafose (ni-afose), tohave divination.Aladngbo, neighbour,„ladvgbo (ni-adugbo), tohave vicinity.
Elekun, mourner,„Mcwn (ni-ekun), tohave grief.
Elegan, slanderer,„legan (nt-egan), tohave slander.

Da,tomake. Ida, actofmaking.

Leru {ni-eru), tohave aburden. Eleru, carrier.
Lofo (ni-ofo), tohave loss. Olofo, loser.
Nida, tohavethemaking. Onida, maker.
(7)Byjoining twonoans, as:—
Ebado, river-side, from eha,brink, edge, andodo, river, brook.
Eyinju, oye-ball, „e^Jin, egg,and oju, eye.
Iboji, grave, „ibi,place, and oji,shade, ghost.
Irinajo, travel, „irin, awalk, and ajo,journey.
(8)Byprefixing a,"not," tonouns commencing
with i.This gives thenotion ofanegative quality
intheabstract. Thus :—
Aife, unwillingness. Ailo, inutility.
From theforegoing itwillbeseen that allnouns
begin with avowel, except those formed byre-
duplication from averb.Afewnounsmaybefound
which appear tobeexceptions tothis rule,buton
investigation they arefound tobeeither :—
(a)Nouns offoreign importation, such asgalas,
east, aHausa word, or
(b)Nouns whose vowel-prefix hasbeen dropped.
Ofthe latter, wefind hoji,agrave;halogun, war-

asweasoften hear iboji asboji,andibalogun asbalo-


LANGUAGE. 205
gun, \TQconclude that hode,andafewofher similar
words, originally hadthevowel-prefix.
Conversely, allwords beginning with avowel are
nouns. Afewwords used asadjectives, adverbs,
orconjunctions, appear atfirstsight tobeexceptions,
butthey areallreally nouns. Thus:—
Abiye, used asanadjective, "-wiugod," really means "something
possessing wings." (^Ahi, something possessing).
Ahila, used toexpress "striped," similarly means "something
possessing stripes."
Ighana, iised toexpress "then," isreally igba (time) andna
(that).
Okpo lohpo, used asanadverb, "plentifully,*' isareduplication of
thenoun okpo, plenty, andmeans literally "plenty-plenty."
Nouns arenotdeclined. Thenoun inthenomina-
tive, orsubjective, case isplaced before theverb, and,
inthe objective, after it.The genitive iseither
expressed, asinEwe,byposition, asHeohonri, house
(ofthe)man, orbymeans of ti,belonging to,as
Hetiokonri, house oftheman.
Theplural isformed byplacing thedemonstrative
pronoun ivonyi (these), orwonni (those), after the
noun, except when anumber isused, inwhich case
thenumber itself, placed after thenoun, sufiiciently
indicates theplural.
There is,properly speaking, nogender inYoruba,
asisshown bythesameword serving forhe,she,or

Aho-malu, cow. Aho-elede, sow.
Akoand abo,when applied toinfants, stand alone,
without being joined toanoun meaning child or

Adjectives.
Adjectives areexpressed invarious ways.
(1.)Byverbs, as:—
Ga,tobetall. Wo, tobebent.
Mo, tobeclean. Eo,tobesoft.
Yi,tobetough. Te,tobeflat.
These adjectival verbs admit ofcomparison, and
aretheonlywords qualifying nouns that canbe
compared. Thecomparative isformed byadding the
verb ju(tosurpass, bemore than) ;andthesuper-
lative byadding theverb lo(toleave, depart), tothe
comparative. Thecomparative isthus expressed by
a'compound verb ofClass III.,andthesuperlative
byoneofClass V.Example:—
Ga,tobetall.
Ga-ju, tobetaller (tobetall, tosurpass).
Ga-jii, lo,tobetallest (tobetall,tosurpass, toleave).
(2)Byverbs ofpossession, as:—
Nikpara (ni-ikjpara), tohaveharm, expresses harmful.
Ntbo {ni-iho), tohave breadth, „ wide.
Nikpa {ni-ikpa), tohave strength, „powerful.
Laiya (iii-aiya), tohave courage, „ brave.


LANGUAGE. 207
Tliese canalsobeused intlienegative. Tlius:—
Lai-nikpara, nottohaveharm, expresses harmless.
Lai-nibo, nottohave breadth, „ narrow.
Lai-nikpa, nottohave strength,„ powerless.
(3)Bynouns withthenegative particle ai(no,not),
orlai(notbeing), prefixed. Thus:—
Aidaba (aiidaba, nohope) canbeused toexpress hopeless.
Aigbona (aiI'gbona, nowarmth)„ „ cold.
Laidaju (laiidaju, notbeing
certainty)„ „ uncertain.
Laidon (lai idon, notbeing
sweetness)„ „unpleasant.
Theonly adjectives proper arethose formed by
reduplication from averb, ordinarily anadjectival
verb. Examples:—
Wiiuo, bent, crooked, from ivo,tobebent.
Tito, straight,„to,tobestraight.
Lile, hard,„le,tobehard.

Dudu, black,,,du,tobeblack.
Kukuru, short,,,Iciiru, tobeshort.
Bum, disordered,,,ru,tostirup,mingle.
Jiiju, confused,,,jic,tosurpass, differ.
Adverbs.
Adverbs areusually expressed byverbs, nouns,
adjectives, orcompounds ofthese, used adverbially.
Theword used asanadverb isalways placed after
theverb orobjective noun. Examples:—

course, some connection between tlieadverb andthe
word itqualifies, wliicli connection wecaninafew
cases discover bjreferring toTshi, Ga,orEwe, but
inothers itremains obscure.
Forexample, take thefollowing adverbs, each of
which canonly berendered inEnglish by"very,"
or"exceedingly."
1.Bin-hiri, very, canonlybeusedwith theverb slm, tobedark, or
gloomy, asoju-orun sliu hiri-biri, "thesky isverygloomy." Here
theconnection isdiscoverable, asthere isinTshi averb, biri, tobe
dark, gloomy, orblack, sothat biri-biri itself would properly mean
"gloomy."
2.Fio-fio, very, canonly beusedwith theverb cja,tobetall,or
with theadjective gicja, tall. This isexplained bytheverbs fro, to
ascend, climb (Tshi);fa,toshoot up(Ga);fo,torise, raise(E^e)
;and/o, tojump, leap(Yomba^, which show that fio-fio, properly means
raised.
3.Rin-rin, very, canonlybeusedwith theverbwuwo, tobeheavy.
As itisareduplication ofrin,tobesaturated, topressdown tothe
ground, theconnection canbeseen.
4.Janjan, very, canonly beused oftheheat ofthesun. Je. is
thesuninEwe.
5.Gara, very, canonly beused with reference totransparency,
clearness
;asamimimo rjara, "very clear water." Thehard"g"is
only asoftened "k,"andwefind ko,tobeclear, pure (E^Ve), and
iron, pure, clear(Ga).
6.Ram-ram, veiy, canonlybeused withtheverb ke,toroar, utter
acryorsound. Ra-ra, loudly, canonlybeusedwith thesame verb.
7.Nini, very, canonlybeused with tutu, tobecold.
8.Dodo, very, canonlybeusedwith ro,toslacken, tocool ardour.
This isperhaps explained bytheverbs de,toslacken (Yoruba)
;do,
toletgo,do,tobegrieved, troubled (EiVe) ;and do,togrant (Ga).
9.Jojo, very, canonly beused with averb ofabundance, as.for
instance, with po,tobemany. Enia pojojo,"the people arcvery
many."
10.Koro, very, canonly l)cused with togothrough. Itis
perhaps from ko,tomeet, and ro,togiveway.
P

11.Kpere-lcpere, very, canonlybeusedwith du,tobeblack. Itis
probably from Icpe,toendure, last,and re,todye.
Similarly eacli colour seems tohave anadverb
proper toit,toconvey themeaning "beantifully."
Thus, Meje canonly beused ofyellow, and/oofa
bright yellow. The latter isexplained bythefact
thatfumeans yellow inGa. Bold-void androrocan

Inthesame way, jigUni (abundantly) canonly
beused offruits;ya'pa (violently) onlywith iva,to

From twohundred upwards theYoruba peoples
reckon bytwohundreds. When thenumber isodd
theysay"Somany twohundreds, lessonehundred,"
and tofacilitate thisprocess theyhave aword ede,
which means "minus onehundred," or"minus one
thousand," according towhether itisused inconnec-
tionwith hundreds orthousands. Twohundred is
tenscore, andcomputation bytwo-hundi^eds isas
natural topeople whoreckon byscores asthatby
hundreds, i.e.,ten tens, istopeople who reckon bv
tens.
Thenumbers from twohundred upwards are,however, ordinarily expressed incowry nomenclature.
Ihese shells arepierced andstrung onstrings tothenumber offorty orfifty,and five oftheformer ortour ofthelattermake uptwohundred cowries, orasmall bundle, called ighawo (owo, cowries), which word

eghaiua, oregha,andtenlarge bundles, ortwenty
thousand cowries, make abag, oheJean {oke,bag,okan,

Sixhundred isegheta (igbio-eta), three small bundles.
Fivehundred isedegbeta (ede-egbeta), three small bundles mmus
onehundred.
Twelve hundred isegbefa {igbio efa), sixsmall bundles.
Sixthousand isegbata (egba-eta), three large bundles.
Fivethousand isedegbata {ede-egbata), three large bundles mmus
onethousand.
When twenty thousand— onebag— isarrived at,the
computation iscontinued bybags:—
Eighty thousand, oke-merin (bags-four).
Onehundred thousand, Oke-marun (bags-five).
Thissystem ofnumeration isclumsy, andcompares
unfavorably with those evolved bytheTshi, Ga,and
Ewe-speaking peoples, which arevery regular. It
exhibits rather stronger traces oftheprimitive practice
ofcounting byfives, tens,andtwenties— that is,byone
hand, twohands, andhands andfeet— than dothe
other systems. Olcan, one,means "something alone,"
andnodoubt refers tothethumb.* Eji,two, ispro-
bably from ji,topick,andmeans "thepicker,'' that
is,theindex-finger. Thisverbappears again ineje,
seven, which would becounted ontheindex-finger of
theother hand. Eta, three, isfrom theverb ta,to
shoot outlengthwise, andthethird, ormiddle finger,
isthelongest. Erin, four, isseemingly from theverb
rm,togo,progress, andwould mean "theprogress-

ing." Arun, five, isfrom run,tobring toanend, finisli.
Itmeans "theending," and fivebrings toanendthe
counting ofthefingers ofonehand. Bfa, six,which
would becounted onthethumb oftheother hand,
seems tomean "thatwhich leads orattracts," andtobe
from fa,tolead, attract, draw ;andewa, ten, ispro-
bably from theverb lua,tocome together, andrefers
totheclosing ofthetwohands when thecounting is
finished. Thederivation ofejo,eight, anderan, nine,
isnotclear. Then eleven, twelve, thirteen, andfour-
teen arerespectively ten-one, ten-two, ten-three, and
ten-four;butfifteen, which completes thecounting on
onehand, isfive lessthan twenty. Thecomputation
isthen carried totheother hand, andwegetfour less
than twenty, three lessthan twenty, andsoon, till
twenty isreached. From twenty totwohundred the
computation isbyscores, that is,byhands and feet.
Theordinal numbers areformed byprefixing ekon
completion, fulness, generally contracted toe/c'—before
thecardinal numbers, butcomplete tensabove ten,
that is,twenty, thirty, &c.,donottake thisprefix!
Thus:—^
First. Ek-eni. Eleventh. Ek-okanla.
Second. Ek-eji. Twentieth. Ocjun.
Third. Ek-eta.Twenty-first. Ek-okan-le-ocjim.
Tenth. Ek-ewa. Twenty-fiftli. Ek-edoghon.
When answering thequestion "Howmany ?"itis
necessary toprefixmtothecardinal number, exceptmthecase ofone, ten,twenty, thirty, &c. Thus,
mefa, six,instead ofefa;meji, two, instead ofeji,and
soon.
Thenumeral adverbs oftimeareformed byprefixing

ara,usually contracted toe,before thecardinal num-
bers, asused inanswer toaquestion. Thus:—
Once, ekan {ara-lcan).
Twice, emeji {aixi-meji).
Thrice, emeta {ara-meta).
Four times, emerin {ara-merin).
Ara isanoun wliicli hastheprimary meaning of
custom, fashion, butalsomeans arepetition.
Thenumeral adverbs oforder areformed bypre-
fixing theverb lelce, tobeprominent, oruppermost,
abbreviated to lelc before the cardinal numbers.
Thus:—
Firstly, leh-eni.
Secondly, lek-cji.
Thirdly, lek-eta.
From thepreceding itwillhave been seen that, as
inTshi, Ga,andEwe, allthewords inthelanguage
arederived from thesimple monosyllabic verbs. The
listofYoruba simple monosyllabic verbs willbefound
intheAppendix, where thefourlanguages arecom-
pared.
There istheusualwant ofdefiniteness inexpressmg
colours. Fufu means white, orany light colour;
dudu, black, dark blue, dark green, pui^ple, orany
dark colour; and pu:pa, red, scarlet, oryellow.
Colours arethusgrouped into three classes, hght,
dark, and reddish. Toexpress different shades of
colour withexactness recourse ishadtonatural objects.
Thus, grey isexpressed byeru, "ashes "
;blue,by
awo-aro,"colour ofthearo," asmall bird ofblue
plumage; light bluebyait;o-o>-onm,"sky-colour "

green byohedo,"duck-weed"

"colour ofthealuko," abird ofapurplisli liue ;and
yellow bjiyeye, thename ofayellow plum, orby
sJiafa-pupa, literally "faded, scraped, red."
That, inspeaking, thewords should follow one
another inthenatural order inwhich theywould
occur tothemind, iswhat istobeexpected from a
people whohave notinvented anelaborate syntax.
Thus theadjective always follows thenoun, anda
native would say"Handkerchief red," instead of
putting theattribute before thesubject, aswedo,
andsaying "Eedhandkerchief." Similarly they say
"Water bring," instead of"Bring water," and"Cold
blows thewind," or,literally, "Coldness owns the
wind," instead of"Thewind blows cold." Inshort,
thenotion which comes first tothemind isthatwhich
isfirstexpressed.

"Wenowcome tothose taleswhich maybecalled
"Tortoise Stories," since thetortoise {aivon) always
plays aleading part inthem. The tortoise has, in
these tales, various superhuman powers attributed
tohim, and, inmost, isdescribed asacting craftily
ormischievously. He,infact, fills inthefolk-lore
tales oftheSlave Coast theplace ofthespider
{anansi) inthetales oftheGrold Coast, andwhich
areinconsequence known asAnansi 'sem {Anansi
asem), "Spider Stories." Inthese thespider is
always depicted asshowing great skilland craft,
and, liketheminor gods, isrepresented asspeaking-
through thenose.
Thenames Tortoise andSpider areinthese stories
used astheproper names ofanthropomorphic per-
sonages, andamong theTshi tribes thelatter iscalled
Aj'ija Anansi, "Father Spider," or"Father Anansi."
Thus, theYoruba proverbial saying, EjiAwon hoIcon
niliowo,used toconvey themeaning that amatter
which atfirst sight appears insignificant may really
beoneofgreat importance, should notbetranslated
"Theblood ofthetortoise isnotahandful "(literally,
"does not fillahand "),but"theblood ofAivon"
(themythical personage, oranthropomorphic tortoise)
"isnotahandful." Anepithet ofthetortoise is
ajajja, "bald-headed elf," or"hairless elf"{aja, elf;
pa,tobebald orbare). Theflickering appearance
seennear theground onsultry days iscalled "tortoise-
fire," and isbelieved tobecaused byasubterranean


FOLK-LORE TALES. 259
firemadebjthetortoise todestroy tlieroots oftrees.
The tortoise appears inseveral proverbial sayings,
as"The tortoise (orAwon) isalways thesubject of
analo"(tale), and"Thehouse ofthetortoise isnot
largeenough foritself. Theverandah "(that is,that
part oftheshellwhich projects over the tail) "of
atortoise will notaccommodate aguest. The
tortoise, having built itshouse, makes theverandah
behind it;"while"As thetortoise meets with due
regard, soalsoshould the snail," seems toindicate
thatthetortoise isregarded withreverence orrespect.
Itispossible thattotemism liesattheroot ofthese
phenomena. OntheGold Coast there isatradition
that allmankind aredescended from Anansi, andon
theSlave Coast thefigure ofthetortoise isfrequently
seencarved onthedoors oftemples, together with the
leopard, serpent, andafish.Onthewhole, however,
itseems more probable that thepeculiarities which
make thespider andthetortoise each initsownway
remarkable, have ledtotheir selection forthechief
role inthepopular fables. The tales being largely
about animals, those creatures which most excited
wonder andspeculation intheminds ofthenatives
would betheones towhich themost wonderful
attributes would beascribed;and, inthecase ofthe
spider, theingenuity andpatience displayed byitin
theconstruction ofitswebwould beattributed tothe
anthropomorphic spider ofthe stories. There isat
thepresent time nospider-clan among thetotem-
clans oftheGold Coast, and, asthecommunities
ofthe G-old Coast areheterogeneous, Avecannot
suppose thatanentire clanhasbecome extinct, unless
s2

theextinction took place intheremote pastwhen
communities were homogeneous ;inwhich case
there seems nosufficient reason forthememory of
thetotem-ancestor being preserved, after the dis-
appearance ofallthose whowere supposed tobe
descended from him.

Myaloisabout amaiden named Buje, theslender.
There wasayoung maiden named Buje, theslender,
whom allthemenwanted. Therichwanted her,but
sherefused. Chiefs wanted, andsherefused. The
kingwanted her,andshe stillrefused.
Tortoise came totheking, andsaid tohim, "She
whom you allwant, andcannot get,Iwill get. Iwill
have her, I."And theking said,"Ifyousucceed
inhaving her,Iwill dividemypalace intotwohalves
andwillgiveyouonehalf."
One day, Buje, theslender, tookanearthen pot
andwent tofetch water. Tortoise, seeing this,took
hishoe,andcleared thepath that ledtothespring.
Hefound asnake inthegrass, andkilled it.Then
heputthesnake inthemiddle ofthepath.
When Buje, theslender, had filled herpot,she
came back. Shesaw thesnake inthepath, and
called out"Hi !hi !Come and killthissnake."
Tortoise ranup,with hiscutlass inhishand. He
struck atthesnake, andwounded himself inthe
leg.
Then hecried out"Buje, theslender, haskilled

Hecried thismany times, and atlastBuje, the
slender, took Tortoise andputhimuponherback.
And then Tortoise slipped hislegsdown over her
hips,andviolated Buje, theslender, from behind.
Next day, assoon asitwas light, Tortoise went to
theking. Hesaid, "DidInot tellyouthat Iwould
have Buje, theslender ?Call allthepeople ofthe
town toassemble onthe fifth day,andyou willhear
what Ihave tosay."
When itwasthe fifth day,theking sent outhis
crier tocall allthepeople together. Thepeople came.
Tortoise cried out,"Everybody wanted Buje, the
slender, andBuje refused everybody, butIhavehad

Theking sentamessenger, with hisstick, tosummon

"Wehaveheard that Tortoise isyourhusband ;isit

CONCLUSIONS.
Inthepreface tothesecond volume oftliis series it
was said tliat, incollecting information concerning
therehgions ofthecognate tribes dealt with,mj
chief purpose wastoendeavour toascertain towhat
extent different conditions ofculture led tothe
modifications ofreligious conceptions. Three groups
oftribes havenowbeen considered, theTshi, the
Ewe, andtheToruba, whorepresent three stages of
progress, theTshi being inthelowest stage andthe
Yoruba inthehighest. Asthese tribal groups un-
doubtedly hadacommon origin, itisreasonable to
suppose thattheYoruba tribes were once inthesocial
andmental condition inwhich theTshi tribes are
now,and that, infact, inthese groups wefindthe
same race indifferent states ofculture. Assuming
then, aswelegitimately may, thatthereligious beliefs
oftheEwes aremodifications ofearlier belief re-
sembling those now.heldbytheTshis, andthatthose
oftheYorubas aresimilarly modifications ofbeliefs
likethosenowheld bytheEwes, weherehave an
opportunity ofobserving howtheevolution ofreligion
mayproceed.
Among theTshi-speaking tribes wefound that

everytliing innature isbelieved tobeanimated—that
istosay,everything notmade byhmnan hands has
ananimating principle, spiritual second-self, or
indwelling spirit, possessing powers which maybe
beneficial orprejudicial toman, according towhether
itispropitiated orneglected. Itseems probable that
thebelief inallnature being thusanimated wasan
extension ofthebelief thatman possesses aspiritual
second-self, orindwelling spirit, which belief is
beyond dispute the result ofsavage speculation
concerning dreams. Man, having decided that he
possessed anindwelling spirit, would extend thesame
possession toanimals, then tovegetable life,and
finally toinanimate nature, partly because hedoes
notperceive any strict line ofdemarcation between
these, andpartly because heasfrequently seesthe
phantoms ofsuch things inhisdreams ashedoesthe
phantoms ofliving meu. Hewould beledtoextend
theindwelling-spirit theory toallnature, because it
would account formany things thatwould otherwise
beincomprehensible, since uncivilised man believes
thatevery occurrence istheresult ofdesign, andthat
nothing everhappens byaccident. Thetheory that
amanwho isdrowned hasbeendrawn down and
strangled bythe water-spirit, seems tohimmuch
more satisfactory than tosuppose that thedeath was
theresult ofchance circumstances.
Allindwelling spirits are,however, notequally
revered. Those ofbushes, grasses, stones, &c., are
notmuch regarded, andthemost important arethose
ofrivers, lagoons, the sea,mountains, rocks, and
shoals. Thereason ofthis,nodoubt, isthatnoloss

inthenature ofthings, menmust occasionally be

and those natural features and objects which
experience hasshown tobemore frequently the

tothem, orrather totheir animating principles, than
those which have proved tobeinnocuous. Every
manworships thatfromwhich hehasmost tofearor

menpaymost attention totheindwelling spirits of

canoes might bem^ecked ;while theagriculturist
worships thespirit ofthestream that flows near his
dwelling, orthat ofthe cliff ormass ofrockwhich
overhangs hisplantation, andthose ofthegigantic
silk-cotton trees, whose downfall sofrequently crushes
todeath theinhabitant ofthe forest. Objects of
worship arethus local, andareworshipped onlyby
those intheneighbourhood. Inmost cases worship
and sacrifice aremade inthehabitat ofthespirit, or

thestream orlagoon;and, asthenature ofthegod

more effectually under theprotection ofthe spirit, if
they were tobring him into the village. They
accordingly make afigure ofclaytaken from the cliff,

place, andthe sacrifices andsacred dances areper-
formed before it,instead of,asheretofore, atthe cliff.
Thegod,however, isnotsupposed tohave absolutely
abandoned the cliff,andpersons whose avocations
tookthem toitwould stillthink itnecessary topro-
pitiate himwith small offerings offood. Practically
heisbelieved tobeinthe cliffandyetalsointhe

explain theseeming impossibility ofoneandthesame

that theimage merely served asaninstrument
through which thegodcould take cognizance ofthe

never seem tothink about thematter atall,and itis
taken forgranted bythevillagers that thegod isin

orlater, theconnection oftliegodwith the cliff, of
which hewastheanimating principle, iscompletely
lostsight of,andheisregarded asthetutelary deity
ofthe village, pure and simple. Inthisway un-
doubtedly originated many ofthetutelary deities of
towns andvillages ontheGrold Coast, fortheprocess
canbeseengoing onatthepresent day.Bycarry-
ing italittle further, tribal ornational godsmight be
similarly produced, but,withtwo orthree exceptions,
theTshi tribes havenotprogressed sofarasthat,and
most ofthegods worshipped bycomplete tribes are
simply theindwelling spirits ofvery remarkable
natural objects situated intheterritories occupied by
thetribes.
Besides thegodswhich aretheanimating principles
orindwelling spirits ofnatural features and objects,
andwhich wemay callnature-gods, wehave objects
ofworship ofanother class, which aretheproduct of
manes-worship, andwhich wemay therefore term
ghost-gods. The ghosts, orsouls ofdeceased men
ofrankandpower, aresupplicated andpropitiated
inthesamewayand tothesame extent asarethe

theoneworship begins andtheother ends.
Manes-worship reaches itsfullest development in
theroyal houses ofAshanti andDahomi, that isto
say,inthose situations where theconditions aremost
favourable forpreserving thememory ofthewisdom
andpower ofdeceased men. Inboth these houses

confusion between objective andsubjective connection
intliecase ofthese gliost-gods aswedointhat of
thenature-gods ;andtheskulls ofchiefs andothers
areoften exhumed andplaced insmall temples
adjoining thedwelling-houses, intheidea that the
guardian-ghost isthereby brought tothespot. At
thebattle ofDodowah, nearAccra, where theAshantis
were defeated in1826, ahead, wrapped inasilk
handkerchief, andcovered with aleopard-skin, the
emblem ofroyalty, wascaptured. Thiswasthehead
ofthelateking, TutuKwamina, and hissuccessor
hadbrought itwith him, intheideathathewould
thereby beable toobtain thesupport oftheghostly
king against hisenemies. Before thebattle offerings
weremade toit,andtheghost wasinvoked tocause
theheads ofallthewhitemen inthe field tolie

Many tutelary deities oftowns, clans, andfamilies
doubtless owe their origin tomanes-worship. The
dead areordinarily, onemight almost sayinvariably,
buried inornear tothehabitations oftheliving, and
itiscertain that inmany cases thehabit ofoffering
sacrifices attheplace ofsepulture hasbeen continued,
simply through habit, long after thefactthataman
was buried there hasbeen forgotten. Insuch a
case, theguardian-ghost being lostsight of,thegod
issimply atutelary god,whose origin iseither unex-
plained, orwhich thepriests explain inanywaythat
may suitthem best. "Wethushavetwoexplanations

forgotten. Ofcourse tliemanes tliemselves are
tutelar.
Nature-gods tliemselves arenodoubt inseveral
cases blended with ghost-gods. The reverence paid
tocertain rivers, rocks, cliffs, &c.,musthave often
dated fromsome fatal accident thatoccurred incon-
nection withthem. Itwas thiswhich first attracted
attention, andprimitive manwould notbelikely todis-
criminate between theghost ofthevictim, which would
haunt thespotwhere thelatter lost his life,andthe
indwelling spirit ofthenatural feature. Neverthe-
less,thatthenature-gods are,asawhole, theproduct
ofmanes-worship, is,wethink, atheory notwar-
ranted bytheevidence, though apparently supported
bythehigh authority ofMr.Herbert Spencer. It
often occurs that afamily settles near tosome river,
lake, orhill,andforthwith commences acult ofthe
indwelling spirit, without any catastrophe having
taken place toinitiate it.Infact, itmaybesaid to
betherulethatwhenever aTshigroup takes upits
abode nearanyremarkable natural feature orobject,
itworships and seeks topropitiate itsindwelling
spirit, fearing that otherwise itmay dosomeharm.
Many ofthenature-gods arenon-terrestrial, and it
isdifficult toseebywhat process they could ever
become confused with dead men. Nobody could be
buried inthesky,sun,moon, rainbow, orwind ;and
ifthese could beconceived tobeanimated without
theintervention ofthesouls ofthedead,whycould
notterrestrial objects also? Manes-worship istheresult
ofthebelief thatmanhasanindwelling spiritwhich sur-
vives after thedeath ofthebody, andnature-worship

istheresult ofthebelief that allnature isanimated.
Which was first inorder itwould bedifficult todeter-
mine with absolute certainty, but,from theanalogy of
thelower animals, itseems probable that thesecond
was. Animals regard objects which move asalive,
without having come totheconclusion that they
themselves have spiritual second selves, andprimitive
man,whowould know littlemore ofnatural causation
thanananimal does, probably didalso.When arock
slipped, oratree fell,theunusual behaviour suggested
animation. Afterwards, when hehadcome tobelieve
thathehimself possessed anindwelling spirit, he
probably conceived theanimating entities ofnatural
objects to'besomewhat analogous, andmade thegods
thereflex ofhisown kra.
Objects madebyhuman hands arenotanimate, and
donotpossess indwelling spirits, though theyhave
ghosts, which thesouls ofthedead areable tomake
use ofindeadland. There are,however, many such
objects uponwhich thenative setsgreat value, andas
theydonotpossess guardian-spirits ofthemselves, he
provides them with artificial ones. Thus, justashe
kills thewives ofhischief, and buries them with
him, releasing their ghosts, orsouls, from their bodies
toenable them tocontinue their ministrations totheir
lord, so,perfectly logically, heslays aslave onthe
family stool, theemblem ofoffice, orupon thegreat
drum ofthetribe, releasing theghost from thebody
inorder toenable ittobecome theguardian-spirit of
thestool ordrum. This isaluxury thatcanonlybe

itisonly tlieroyal stools ofkings and chiefs, orpara-
pliernalia belonging totlietribe asawliole, tliat are,
asarule, thus protected. Thevictim isdecapitated
upon theobject sothattheblood gushes over it,and
ontheGold Coastmany tribal stools anddrums are
clotted thick with theblood ofthosewhohavebeen
slainupon them, for itseems tobethought necessary
torenew theguardian from time totime. As,when
ahuman sacrifice isoffered toagod,thevictim is
similarly slainupon thesacred stool orchair, itseems
probable thattheghost isinthiscase alsobelieved to
become aguardian-spirit. Nodoubt thebelief that
allobjects notmade byhuman hands possessed in-
dwelling, orguardian- spirits, suggested theidea of
supplying artificial guardian-spirits toobjects which
didnotcome under this category. The practice is
very widespread, and thecustom ofimmolating
human victims atthelaunching ofwar-cauoes in
theislands ofthe Pacific, sothat thebows were
sprinkled with their blood, andtheDyak practice of
crushing aslave-girl todeath under the first post
erected atthebuilding ofacommunal house, arecases
inpoint, thesacrifice being ineach case designed to
provide aguardian-spirit.

characteristics oftheobjects they animate. Thus,
because thesilk-cotton treehasagaunt, greyish- white
trunk, which towers high above theother trees ofthe
forest, andoften reaches toaheight of100feetbefore
itthrows outabranch, Srahmantin issaid tobeof
gigantic stature and greyish-white incolour. To
these characteristics native imagination hasadded
long flowing hair, and long pendent breasts.

Among theEwe tribes wefind thesame funda-

currently with theincrease inthenumber oftribal
andgeneral gods runs therelegation ofthepurely
localgods toaninferior position. Agodwho iswor-
shipped overalarge area isnaturally believed tobe
more powerful than onewhose area ofworship is
circumscribed, andthetribal andgeneral gods, having
each their special functions andattributes, monopolise
between them nearly allthephenomena andqualities
which excite fearandrespect inman. The localgods
arethuspushed back from theprominent position
theyheldamong theTshi tribes, withwhom topro-
pitiate thelocalgodwasconsidered allimportant,
andthough they areworshipped bysmall communities
andsolitary families, theinhabitants oftowns donot

mena areattributed toanewconception, Khebioso, a
bird-like god,who appears tobethe personified
thunder-cloud, hedoes nothing but control the
rain,and hisimportance hasbeen thereby lessened.
Other general deities areAizan, protector ofmarkets
andpublic places, whoseems tobeatype generalised
from themultitudinous tutelary gods oftheGold
Coast;Dso, thegodoffire,Legba, aphallic divinity,
andSapatan, thesmall-pox god. Inthis deification,
orpersonification, offire, love, and pestilence, we
seeanewdeparture. Tire isnotworshipped onthe
Gold Coast, andthere itisthelocal godswho inflict
pestilence ontheir worshippers asapunishment for

bytheghost-gods, who, astheforefathers ofthe

gation oftheir descendants, though occasionally the
exciting ofthispassion maybefound tobeoneout
ofthemany attributes ofanature-god.

tribes. Tliere are, inconsequence, few local gods

goddess, saidbythepriests tobetheearth, presides
over thepassion oflove. Orisha Oko,who repre-
sents natural fertility, AjeShaluga, god ofwealth,
Shigidi, personified nightmare, andDada, patron of
vegetables, arenew conceptions. Anative ofthe

Theevolution oftypes hasbeen carried further
thanamong theEwes, andinstead ofeach hilland
mountain having itsownindwelling godwehaveOke,
god ofheights ingeneral ;while inplace ofthe
multitude oflocal sea-gods found ontheGold Coast
andthewestern half oftheSlave Coast, wehave one
general god ofthe sea,Olokun. Aroni, god of

tion, wlio istliebenefactor ofmanand tlieunveiler of

doubt wasOsanbin, god ofmedicine. Ogun, god of
iron, andbence ofwar,maybeapersonification of
iron, but itisjust asprobable thathewasthetradi-
tional discoverer oftheuseofiron,andhence aghost-
god,whohasnowbeen raised tothe first rank. In
thegeneral tendency toregard Legba asthe evil
principle, weperhaps seeafirst steptowards dualism,
inwhich Ifa, forchoice, would represent thegood
principle. Allthegods aremore anthropomorphic
thanwasthecasewith theEweandTshi tribes.
Looking, then, atthese three groups oftribes, we
findwhat seems tobearegular progression from the
gods ofhamlets andsmall communities, asamong the
Tshis, tothegods ofawhole people, asamong the
Yorubas; andfrom theworship ofthe indwelling-
spirits oftangible objects, orobjects believed tobe
tangible, asthesky,and ofdeadmen, totheworship
ofpersonified principles. With theaggregation of
peoples comes theconcretion ofgods. Onthe Grold
Coast thenatives dwell insmall groups, isolated from
oneanother bylarge tracts offorest. There areno
towns, properly speaking, except onthesea-coast, and
only afewlarge villages. Ideas percolate butslowly,
andpeople liveinthenarrow circle oftheirown lives,
knowing little ornothing ofanything that transpires
outside their own hamlet. Tothem theirown
surroundings areofthefirstimportance, andthelocal
god isthe first intheir estimation. There isno
room here forthegrowth ofnational andgeneral

gods, foreverything isnarrowed down tothevillage
circle.
Among thoseEwe tribeswho inhabit thewestern
andforested portion oftheSlave Coastwefindmuch
thesame condition ofaffairs ;but inthe eastern
Ewe districts thecountry iscomparatively open,
communities arelarger, andcommunication isinevery
way freer. Here ideas circulate readily, man is
constantly meeting with man, and ashismental
circle widens, sodohisconceptions concerning the
nature ofgods. Thus,among theeastern Ewe tribes
wefindmany national and tribal gods, andseveral
general gods, while thelocal gods have sunk inthe
general estimation.
Among theYoruba tribes thisevolution hasbeen
carried stillfurther, thecountry, except thatinhabited
bytheJebus, being fairly open, largetowns numerous,
and circulation constant. Here the localgodhas
almost disappeared, andthegreat majority ofthe
gods areknown to,andworshipped by,thewhole of
the tribes. The origin andinception ofthenature-
gods, astheindwelling spirits ofnatural objects or
phenomena, being generally lost sight of,some
explanation oftheir existence becomes necessary,
and, inconsequence, wefind avariety ofmyths
dealing with theparentage andadventures ofthe
gods.
Asfarasmanes-worship alone isconcerned—that
is,theworship ofspirits orgodswhich areknown to
have once beenmen—there isnogreat difference
between the three lingual groups. Among the
Yorubas itis,ifanything, rather lessdeveloped than

among tlieTsliis andEwes, orratlier relegated toan
inferior position, inconsequence oftliegreater power
andsway oftiiegods generally worshipped. When-
ever, however, thehuman origin oftheghost-god
hasbeen lostsight of,heseems tohave conformed
tothegeneral rule ;that is,where thecircumstances
have been unfavourable, hehas, liketheminor local
nature-gods, disappeared, orbeen absorbed inthe
personality ofanother god,andwhere theyhavebeen
favourable, hehasacquired increased renoAvn and
area ofworship, andbecome anational orgeneral god.
That with thenationalisation ofgods thepriest-
hood should alsobecome organised anddeveloped is
anatural result. Both ontheG-oldandSlave Coasts,
and, indeed, everywhere else, thepriesthood isa
guild, orfraternity, themembers ofwhich require a
special knowledge ;andnoman orwoman canbecome
amember ofitwithout apreliminary training, or
apprenticeship. OntheGrold Coast, however, there
arenodistinct orders, orbodies, ofpriests. Thegods
being infinite innumber, and local, thegroups of
priests are infinite innumber, and local, andhave
nocohesion. Inevery village there willbefound
three orfour priests whoknow thesacred dances and
special ceremonies required fortheworship ofthe
gods peculiar tothat village, buttheyknow nothing
ofthe rites andceremonies ofthegods ofother
towns. OntheSlave Coast, ontheother hand, each
general god oftheEwe tribes, except Mawu, hasin
every town and village aconsiderable number of
priests, whose duty itistominister tohimand to
him alone. Colleges andseminaries fortheinstruc-

tion ofnovices arenumerous, and toeachgodare
attached anumber oftemple-women, orwives.
Among theYoruba tribes priestlj organisation is
carried still further, andthere arethree recognised
orders ofpriests, each ofwhich issubdivided into
grades. OntheGrold Coast apriest might officiate
indifferently before anygod ofthelocality forwhich
hewas, sotospeak, ordained ;but ifaYoruba priest
ofShango were toattempt toconsult Ifatherewould
beasgreat acommotion astherewould beifaRoman
Catholic priest were toattempt topreach inaBaptist
Chapel. There is,infact, ahealthy competition
between thepriests oftheprincipal gods, andeach
guard theirown privileges very jealously.
Religion, atthestage ofgrowth inwhich wefind
itamong these three groups oftribes, hasnoconnec-
tionwith morals, orthe relations ofmen toone
another. Itconsists solely ofceremonial worship, and
thegods areonlyoffended whensome riteorceremony
hasbeen neglected oromitted. Iftheomission be
quite unintentional theresult isjustthesame, asthe
gods, like uncivilised man, judge byactsandnotby
motives. In allagesmanmakes God themoral
counterpart ofhimself, and insavage lifeheonly
revenges thatwhich affects himself. With thewrongs
ofothers hehasnothing todo. Ifamanmurdered
hisneighbour androbbed thewidow andorphans,
thatwould beamatter thatwould notconcern
thegods inthe least, and, provided hepaid the
usual homage expected bygodsfrom their followers,
hewould beassecure oftheir favour and pro-
tection as ifhewere perfectly innocent ofall

crime. Onthe otlier hand, years ofblameless life
would notsave amanfrompunishment ifheomitted
some customary rite, orinadvertently gave offence.
Similarlv, intheHebrew books, wefind that the
detestable fraud perpetrated byJacob upon his
brother Esau didnotinanywaylessen thefavour
withwhich hewasregarded bythenational god;but
when theunfortunate TJzzah, with thebest intentions
intheworld, putforth hishand andheld thearkto
keep itfrom falling, hewasstruck dead, because the
action implied that thegodwasnotable toprotect
himself. So, too,among theancient Greeks, the
godstooknocognisance ofsocial offences, andonly
revenged slights offered tothemselves;as,when they
caused Protesilaus, thehusband ofLaodamia, tobe
the firsthero slain before Troy, because she,inher
eagerness toconsummate hermarriage, forgot to
propitiate them with theusual sacrifices.
The belief that religion hasnoconnection with
morals thusseems tobeinherent inmanwhen ina
certain intellectual and social condition, and itisnot
byanymeans atonce gotridofbytheadoption of
thereligion ofahigher race inwhich thetwo are
associated. Theuneducated negroes ofourcolonies,
forinstance, whohave been nominally Christian for
some three generations, practically believe that the
commission ofgrave moral offences, andeven crimes,
willnotintheleast affect their prospects offuture
"salvation," provided that they gotochurch or
chapel regularly, and, infact,paytheir god allthat
ceremonial homage and lip-service which is,intheir
yiew, theessence ofreligion.

On tlieGold and Slave Coasts tliere isperfect
liberty ofthouglit inmatters ofreligion, butaman
mustshowoutward respect forthegods, because to
dootherwise istoprovoke calamities. Amanmay
worship many gods, ornone, just ashepleases, but
hemust notinsult any. Infact, atthis stage,man
tolerates anyform ofreligion that tolerates others;
and ashethinks itperfectly natural that different
people should worship different gods, hedoes not
attempt toforce hisownpersonal opinions upon any-
one,ortoestablish conformity ofideas.
Thestriking resemblance which theYoruba religious
system bears tothat oftheancient Greeks can
scarcely have escaped notice. Olorun, thesky-god
proper, nowbeing gradually displaced bythemore
anthropomorphic Obatala, resembles Uranus, whowas
displaced byKronos. InGreek mythology Kronos
married hissister Ehea, theearth, andtheYoruba
myth, makes Obatala marry Odudua, who alsorepre-
sents theearth, though thequalities ofAphrodite
appear topredominate. Olokun answers toPoseidon,
Ogim, worker iniron, toHephoestus, Orisha Oko to
Priapus, Osanhin to^sklepius, Orun, thesun, to
Helios, andOshu, themoon, toSelene. Zeus' mes-
senger, Hermes, thelightning, wastheprotector of
plunderers, andShango isthegodoflightning and
plunder. Ifa,asthegodofprophecy, andthebeing
whowards offevilandaffords help, resembles Apollo,
who, inHomer, isperfectly distinct from thesun-god,
though identified withhiminlater times.*
*IntheSoman mythology Airmarried Earth, andthemarriage
wasrenewed every year inspring. (Virgil, Gcorg. ii.,32.5.) Here,
Air(Orungan) marries Water (Yemaja).

The spirits oftlietreesanswer totheHama- dryads,

phosis toabrook, spring, orlagoon iscommon, and
wehaveoneexample ofagirlbeing transformed, like
Daphne, into ashrub. The gods,when consulted,
gave oracular responses that differ innoessential
particular from theanswers given bytheOracle of
Delphi. TheYorubas, liketheG-reeks, offerhuman
sacrifices intime ofnational need. Dancing was,
with theGreeks, intimately connected with wor-
ship, asLucian says :*"You cannot find a
single ancient mystery inwhich there isnot
dancing;" and onthe Grold and Slave Coasts
every god ofnote has hisown dance, which
issacred tohim, andknown only tothe
initiated. The religion ofancient Grreece hasbeen
obscured byagreat deal oflater poetic imagery;
but,whenwelook into itclosely, itisfound tobe
similar tothat oftheYorubas, andwasnodoubt
produced when theG-reeks were inalikeintellectual

From acomparison ofthesystems ofconsanguinity
ofthese lingual groups weareable totrace theorder
ofevolution ofthefamily, andtheresults gotoshow
thatDr.Starcke's* theories ofthepriority ofasys-
tem ofkinship through fathers areincorrect, and
thatMr.McLennan was right inhisgeneral conclu-
sions that descent through mothers was first in
order.
Among theTshi tribes oftheGold Coast descent
issolely andexclusively inthefemale line.Afamily
isanumber ofpersons connected byuterine ties,
allofwhom bear thesame clan-name. The clan-
name isthetest ofkinship, andafamily isasmall

toeach other areknown, within thewider circle of
more distant relations, that is,theclan atlarge.
Marriage within theclan isforbidden, andhence a
father cannot berelated byblood tohischildren, or
beofthesame family. Succession toproperty, office,
ordignity follows the line ofblood-descent, anda
man's heir ishisbrother, or,failing abrother, his
sister's son.
Among theGatribes oftheGold Coast descent is

perty isstill considered tobevested infamilies,
rather than inindividuals, andsuccession toproperty
remains inthefemale line, inthesame order as
among theTshi tribes.
Among thewestern Ewe tribes thelawofblood-
descent, andofsuccession tooffice orproperty, isthe
same aswith theGatribes ;butamong theeastern
Ewe tribes, inDahomi, blood-descent isonboth sides
ofthehouse, andsuccession inthemale line. This
change has,however, onlytaken place intheroyal
family ofDahomi, andamong whatmaybetermed
the aristocracy, who appear tohave followed the
lead oftheir sovereign. Thelower orders still trace
descent inthefemale line,andthatthehigher orders
used also todosoisshown bytheterms inusefor
expressing relationships. Brother and sister, for
instance, canonly berendered by"mother's son"

isforbidden both inthefather's andmother's family

Theoldideas concerning blood-descent still,however,
exercise some influence, andchildren bythesame

sidered proper blood-relations. Thus, going from

change from kinship and descent through mothers
onlj, tokinship anddescent through both parents.
Wearealso able totrace theevolution ofsociety
from thestage inwhich thegroup, orcommunity, as
awhole, protected itsownrights andexacted redress
forinjuries, tothat inwhich thestate protects the
individual andpunishes crime.
Itwould appear that, atfirst, thecommunity or
group wasthe social unit,andhad collective rights
and responsibilities, every member ofthegroup
having aright totheprotection ofthegroup asa
whole, andbeing inturn responsible individually for
theacts oromissions ofthegroup asawhole, or
ofanymember ofit. Ifwemight speculate onthis
subject wemight saythat thiscondition dated from
thetimewhen thegroup washomogeneous, andhad
notyetbeen broken upinto different clans bythe
system ofblood-descent through mothers. Either no
notion ofblood-descent atallhadbeen formed, or,if
formed, thegroup-tie, the tieofassociation and
comradeship, wasconsidered ofmoremoment than
theblood-tie. The soleremaining trace ofthis con-
dition tobefound among thethree lingual groups
under consideration liesintherightwhich acreditor,
whose debtor belongs toanother community, hasto

member ofafamily isindividually responsible forall
theothers. The state, represented bythetribal or
village-chief, takes nocognisance ofoffences unless
they aresuch asdirectly concern, orarebelieved to
concern, theinterests ofthecommunity asawhole.
Treason andwitchcraft arealmost theonly offences
that the state takes cognisance of.Incases of
homicide, theft, rape, assault, and injury tothe
person orproperty, itisthefamily oftheperson
whohassuffered that alone candemand andexact
satisfaction. Noone elsehasaright tointerfere,
and, ifthefamily should choose toforego all
demands, noonehas aright tosay anything.
Reparation isnotsought directly from theoffender,
butfrom thefamily towhich hebelongs. Itis,in
fact, acase ofonefamily arrayed against another.
Where thecontending parties cannot come to
mutual agreement astothereparation, theinjured
party brings thecase before the state, that is,the
chief, who, until thus called upon toarbitrate, has
nopower toact. There isnofixed scale ofpunish-
ments orawards ;theinjured family assesses its
damages, and, iftheinjuring family does notaccept

referred tothechief forsettlement. Murder isnot
necessarily punished with death, forthefamily of
thedeceased may, iftheythink fit,accept amoney-

position oftheinjured. Inthecontrary case the

injuries totlieperson orproperty are left totlie

property, andtheimposition ofafineonthefamily, is
nolonger considered asufficient reparation fortheft.
Theft hascome toberegarded asanoffence against
social order, inwhich thewhole community is
interested, andhence afirst offence ispunished by
flogging orfine, asecond bymutilation, andathirdby
death. The family, being nolonger collectively

notallowed todealwiththeguiltymember asitthinks

sible forhisownconduct, andpunishment fallsupon

Wearealsoable totrace tosome extent theevolu-
tion ofideas concerning property. Inthose groups of
tribes which trace descent through mothers only,
property isvested infamilies rather tha,n inindi-
viduals. There is,ofcourse, individual property, but
itusually islimited tominor articles, such asutensils,
weapons, &c. Houses, thefamily gold ornaments,
insignia, stools, andproperties thathavebeenhanded
down frombygone generations, arevested inthehead
ofthefamily, andcannot bealienated without thecon-
sent ofthefamily asawhole. Atthedemise ofthe

group ofkindred, and isdivided among theheirs,who
arethesons, or,indefault ofsons, brothers. Ashere,
equally with thetribeswho trace descent solely inthe
female line, theorder ofsuccession isunalterable;
property inallcases remains inthefamily, theonly
difference being thatamong theYorubas itisdis-
tributed with each succeeding generation, instead of
being kept together ;butthetendency oftheYoruba
custom undoubtedly istodestroy thenotion that
property belongs tothegroup ofkindred, andtomake
itindividual.
Inthecase ofallthetribes land isheld incommon,
andthere isnoindividual property inland,though
thenotion thatland canbetheproperty oftheindi-
vidual, instead ofthecommunity, has,ashasbeen said,
begun toappear among theYorubas. Probably, in
early times, moveable aswell asimmoveable property
wasoncecommon. Itstill is,toalarge extent, com-
mon tothefamily, and, atanearlier stage,when the
group washomogeneous, itwasnodoubt common to
thegroup orcommunity;forthecustom which allows
acreditor toseize theproperty ofathird party
belonging tothesamecommunity asthedebtor, seems
topoint toanotion that thecommunity asawhole
musthave benefited bywhat thedebtor received. If
allproperty were oncecommon tothegroup, asland
isnoAY, then thefollowing changes probably occurred.
When thehomogeneous group became heterogeneous,
andbroke upintoclans inconsequence ofthesystem

uterine family, asitstill isontheGold Coast;and,
wlien tlieuterine families came toanend,owing to
therecognition oftheblood-tie between father and
child, property became vested inhouseholds, asitis
with theYorubas. Inother words, astheunits of
which society was originally composed became sub-
divided into smaller and smaller groups, sodid
property become vested inagradually decreasing
number ofpersons, until itfinally became individual.

APPENDIX. 3y9
Alltheprimitive monosyllabic verbs havenowbeengrouped under
these eight roots, except those intheYoruba language which begin
with theletter ?•,andthefollowing :—
TSHI.
1.Je,toprotect, defend, receive, take. This probably belongs to
Eoot V. (c),and isavariation ofsho, towatch, observe, guard
(Yoruba).
2.Tyu, torub,brush, cleanse, wipe. Thismost likely isavaria-
tionofTsu,andbelongs toRootV.(e)or(g). IntheFanti dialect
ofTshi itispronounced Tchu.
GA.
3.She, tofear,beafraid of,respect.
EWE.
4.To,toown.
5.Gbe, toturn, twist, plait, braid.
6.Kpo, tolook, see,peep at,seek for,search.
7.Fo,tobeready.
8.Vu,totear, rend.
YORUBA.
9.Di, tobelessthan, tocompensate, retaliate. This probably
belongs toRoot VIII.
10.Lu, tobore, perforate, bediscovered.
11.Yi,tobetough orfibrous.
12.Yi,tomove, turn.
InTshi, Ga,orEwe theletter rnever commences aword, sothose
commencing with that letter inYoruba have doubtless undergone a
euphonic change. Insome instances aninitial consonant hasbeen
dropped. Thus Re, tobetired, faint, orweary, tofade, wither, be
red,wasnodoubt originally Bre, forthere isaTshiverbBre, tobe,
orget, tired, and also averb Bere, tobe,orget, red. Similarly,
Ru, toperish, belost, putrify, rot
;Re,tomoult, fall off"(ofleaves
orhair),Ro,towither, weaken, droop, beblighted, were probably
originally Bra, Bre,Bro, orPra, Pre,Pro,andbelong toRoot YII.


400 THEYOEUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
(e)and (f). Ri,todrown, sink, immerse, liasperhaps beenchanged
fromMi; Ro,tosound, excite, stimulate, from Bo,andRu, to
sprout, flourish, spring up,fromi^-w, orFra.
Eecapitulating oureight groups orroots,welindthat—
1.Fsignifies from, forth, coming from, issuing, appearing.
2.Hsignifies surface, exterior, outside.
3.Msignifies interior, inside, middle, midst.
4.Nsignifies spreading, extending, stretching.
5.Ssignifies changing, twisting, turning.
6.Ksignifies unity, completeness, being unique.
7.Bsignifies violence, exertion.
8.Dsignifies down, deep.
These coincide withtheprimitive consonants ofthefourlanguages.
Taking theconsonants which inTshi form, bymeans ofavowel, the
primitive monosyllabic verbs, wefindthem tobe—
b,d,f,g,h,j,k,m,n,p,s,t,v,w,y.
InGaandEweweget Iaswell,andinYoruba both Iand r,but
these arenodoubt innovations. Ofthe fifteen consonants ofthe
Tshilanguage—
phasbeen differentiated from &,orviceversa.
Vfrom /.
g,always hard, isavariation ofk.

yoriginated from eor i.
mandnwere nodoubt originally thesame, though the latter
seemsnow toconvey adifferent setofnotions.
The fifteen consonants maythusbereduced to(1) b,p ;(2)f,v;
(3)k,g ;(4)h;(5)s,sh,j;(6)d,t
;(7)m,n(or(7)mand
(8)n),which agree with theeight groups orroots.
Afewpeculiarities maybebriefly noted :—
(1)Thesame notion may beexpressed byoneroot inonelanguage
andbyatotally different root inanother language. Theexplanation
isthattheaction orcondition isregarded from adifi'ereni point of
view. Thus wegettheverb /m, tosmell (Ga), from thepoint of


APPENDIX. •iOl
vieT ofasmoll emitted (Hoot I.),* andImam, tosmell (Tshi), and
hive, tosmell (Ewe), from thepoint ofview ofasmell perceived
(Root IT.), ilfa, tobreathe (Ga), isbreathing regarded asan
internal action (Root III.) ;andha,tobreathe. (Ewe) isbreathing
regarded asamotion ofthesurface ofthebody. Ferre, tofear
(Tshi), andfe,fear, fright (Ga), arefearconsidered from thepoint of
view ofsomething terrible, harmful, orbadappearing orcoming
forth andcausing fear;while ehu, fear(Tshi), isfearconsidered asa
condition ofthebody. This peculiarity isperhaps best seen inthe
case ofverbs meaning tospeak, utter words. Ka,tospeak, and he,
tosay, tell(Ga);Ka-sa, tospeak, talk'(Tshi);and ke,toexclaim
(Yoruba), refer tospeech regarded asasuccession ofwords uttered
singly andone after theother (Root VI. ).Be, totell, narrate
(Tshi);betotell, relate (Ewe);and hi,toask, enquire, question
(Ga) ;refer tospeech regarded asbetween two ormore persons in
juxta position (Root VII.). Ba, tobeg, beseech (Ga), and he,to
beg,beseech (Yoruba) may likewise beconsidered asspeech regarded
asthemedium ofconversation between twopersons, though these
verbs appear more properly tohave reference tothebending orpro-
strating ofbody which isalways practised bysupplicants. Do,to
say, speak, tell(Ewe), isspeech regarded asconnected with the
depths ofthemonth orthroat (Root VIII.). Se,tosay,andshu, to
speak (Tshi);se,todeny, and so,totalk, tell(Yoruba);isspeech
regarded asasuccession ofchanges ofsounds orwords (Root V.).
(2)Notions which areclosely allied andwhich wemight reason-
ablyexpect tofindexpressed bythesame root inanyonelanguage
areoften expressed bydifferent roots. Thus "fire," and"toflame,"
arenotions closely allied, yetinYoruba "fire"isina,which iseither
from na,tospread, extend, orfrom na,towaste (Root IV.);and
"toflame"isjo,which hasreference tothetwisting, turning, and
dancing offlames (Root V.). The verb "toburn "canonly be
expressed byacombination ofthetwo inthecompound verb jana.
InEwe,"fire"isdso,"the twister," or"the dancer" (Root V.);
while"toburn "isfia,wliich refers tosomething appearing or
coming forth, whence afi,ashes (Root I.).
(3)Thesame verb can often beused toexpress actions which
"Whence /«,burial, because corpses arealways keptsome days before inter,
ment.
2D


402 THEYORUB A-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
appear tobediametrically opposed. Thus theGaverbnme(Root
III.), canbeused tomean "toopen," or"toshut." Theexplana-
tion isthat theverb really expresses anaction affecting theinterior
orinside ofsomething, andopening exposes theinside while shutting
hides itfrom view. Theremainder ofthespoken sentence explains
tothehearer thesense inwhich itisused, or,failing that, theexact
meaning isindicated bygesture.* Ifaman were tosay"Inmea
boxandtook clothes out," itwould bemanifest tohisaudience that
nmewasthere used asaverb "toopen." Similarly theverbdsa
(Ga) isused toexpress "todivide," or"tojoin." itreally means
"toeffect achange," and socanonly beused with regard tothe
division ofthings formerly absolutely united, orthejoining of
things completely separate. Itcould not, forinstance, beused to
express ajoining ofthetwohands ofthesame psrson.
(4) Ifthesame verbmay express notions which appear tobe
diametrically opposed, ofcourse thesame rootmay. Thus, under
Hoot v.,wefind theTshi verbs so,toseize, catch, takehold of,and
si,tostand, put, place, set;both ofwhich primarily mean achange of
position. From thenotion oftaking hold of,taking into thehands,
comes that oftaking up,lifting, which isseen inthesecondary verbs
soa,tolift,carry, and sorre, torise,ascend;and finally socomes to
beused asapreposition "on,upon, above, up."Byasimilar process
thenotion ofstanding, putting, placing, leads toputting outofthe
hands andputting down, sothatfimiUy from siwegetthenoun asi,
bottom, lower part,which isused asapreposition oradverb inthe
sense of"under, beneath, below." Thusupon orabove, andunder or
below, areexpressed bythesame root. Possibly the fact that our
verb "torise"really belongs tothesame root astheoldGerman
risan, to fall, French arriser, tolet fall,f might besimilarly
explained.
*Ifalanguage contained many words such asthis, itiscomprehensible that
conversation would bedifficult inthedark,when thegesture necessary tomake
themeaning clear could notbeseen. Ithasbeen asserted thatatribenearCape
Palmas isinthiscondition, buttheassertion requires corroboration.
