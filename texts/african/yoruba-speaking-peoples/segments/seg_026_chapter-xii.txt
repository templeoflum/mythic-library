(1)Verhs.
(1)InYoruba, asinTshi, Ga,andEwe, allsimple
roots aremonosyllabic verbs, consisting ofaconsonant
followed byavowel. These, wliicli are tlieprimitive
verbs, wewill callverbs ofClass I.Examples :—
Ba,tomeet. Je,toeat. Wa, tocome.
Bi,tobeget. Mo, todrink. Mi,tobreathe.
Da, tomake. Lo,togo. Wo, tosee.
(2)Verbs ofClass II.areformed from Class I.,
byadding aliquid n.
Yan, togape,yawn ;from ya,toopen, part.
(3)Verbs ofClass III. areformed byusing to-
getlier twoverbs ofClass I.,wliicli are,however,
separated bytheobjective noun. They arewhatwe
styled, inEwe, "Separable Compound Verbs."
Examples:—
Ba-ja, tofight with ;from ha,tomeet, andja,tofight.
Ba-ro, toadvise; »ba,tomeet, and ro,toconsider.
Di-mo, toenclose; „di,toshut, andmo,tostop.
Gba-la, torescue; „gba, totake, and la,tosave.
Du-ro, todesist, cease;„du,tostrive, and ro,toease.


LANGUAGE.593
(4)Verbs ofClass IV.areformed byjoining a
verb ofClass I.andanoun, as:—
Bila, togivewny, give place;from ii,tosliove, and ila,opening
Laja, toreconcile
; „/a,tosave,and ija,strife
Kpeja, tofish
; „kpe, tokill,and eja, fish.
Da-meji, todivide
; „da,tomake, andmeji, two.
(5)Further compound verbs aremade byusing
verbs ofClasses II.and III. witli verbs ofClass I.,
as:—'
(a)Dacluro, toprevent;from da,tomake, andduro, tocease.Dahoja, toneglect;„da,tomake, andkoja, toomit.
Kpekpada, torecall
;„kpe,tocall,andkpada, tocome
back.
(b)Teballe, tobenddown
;„te,tobend, andbalk, totouch the
ground.
Bawijo, tojudge„ba,tomeet, andwijo, tocomplain.
(6)Verbs ofanother class, and wliicli may be
called "verbs ofpossession," areformed byplacing
theverb ni,tohave, before anoun. Before the
vowels a,e,0,and u,niischanged euphonically toli,
ovV. Thus:—
Ni-dagiri, tobealarmed
; from ni,andidagiri, alarm.
Ni-beru, tofearandz5mi, fear.
Ni-kpekun, toterminate ;••„ andikpekwi, end.
Laba {ni-aba), tobehopeful
; „ni,andaba,hope.

; „ni,andaga,weariness.LeU (ni-ebi), tobehungry
; „ni,and ebi,hunger.
Lete (ni-ete), tointend; „ni,and ete,intention.
Lotvo (ni-oivo), toberich
; „ni,and 0100, wealth,
iov/^n (K/.o?/Mra), tobepregnant
;„ni,andoyun, pregnancy.

Negative Voice.
AsinTslii, Ga,andEwe, verbs arealsoconjugated
negatively. InYoruba tliis iseffected byplacing
thenegative particle aibefore theverb. Thus:—
Fe,tolove. Aife, nottolove.
Aiiscompounded ofa,not,andthesubstantive
formative prefix i,signifying astate ofbeing.
Thenegative particle ofaverb ofpossession islai,
which issimply ai,with theverbm,tobe,euphoni-
callychanged to I,placed before it.Example:—
Lowo (ni-owo), toberich,have wealth.
Lai-lowo, nottoberich (literally, "nottobetohavewealth ").
Many verbs denote aquality, as:—
Le,tobehard, orstrong.
Du,tobeblack.
Mo,tobeclean.
Articles.
The indefinite article isexpressed byohan (one)
being placed after thenoun. Itisalmost invariably
abbreviated toJean.
The definite article isexpressed bythedemonstra-
tivepronoun na(that), which isplaced after the
noun. Thus:—
Olconri kan,aman;literally, "oneman."
Olconri na,theman;literally, "thatman."


LANGUAGE.199
Tronouns.
(1)Personal pronouns.
When used inconjunction witli averb, tliepersonal
pronouns are:—
Emi, mo,orncj, I. Aioa,We.
Iioo, or0,Thou. Enyin, You.
On,orno.He,she,or it.Aioon, ornwon, They.
-Mo, I,cannot beusedwith thefuture tenses. Kg
ismorecommonly used inthefuture than emi,and is
often usedwhenever then,signifying action notjet
completed, isprefixed totheverb. Theindependent
forms ofthepersonal pronouns arethesame asthose
given first above. Thepersonal pronouns aremade
possessive bjplacing iibefore them. Tiisan
obsolete verb,nowonlyused inthesense of"of"or
"belonging to." Thus:—
Tiemi,ort'emi, Mine. Tiawa, ort'awa, Ours.
Tiiwo,ortHwo, Thine. Tienyin, ort'enyin, Yours.
Tion,ort'on, His. Tiawon, orti'ivon, Theirs.
Theobjective personal pronouns are:—
Mi,Me.T^a,Us.
Wo,or0,Thee. Nyiji, You.
A,e,i,0,oru,Him, her, it.Wo7i, Them.
Aswillbeseen, they are,with theexception ofthe
third person singular, thenominative personal pro-
nouns with theinitial vowel omitted. Theparticular
form tobeused toexpress him, her,orit,isdeter-mmed bythevowel-sound oftheverb, abeing used
with averb inwhich thesound ofaoccurs, and
soon.Thus:—
awould beusedwith theverb ba,orwith kan.
^ " J) » gc-
^ " )) SI,orwith rin.


200 THEYORUBA-SFEAKING PEOPLES.
The personal pronouns aremade reflexive by
adding ti-kara {ti, of,orbelonging to; ara,body,
form):—
Tikara 'vii,Myself. Tikara 'wa,Ourselves.
Byplacing na(thesame that) after apersonal
pronoun theparticularising power isincreased. It
denotes theexclusion ofanyother person, andanswers
to"myself," "himself," &c.:—
Emi na,Imyself. Aioa na,Weourselves.
(2)Relative pronouns.
There isonly one, viz.: ti,which means who,
whom, which, that.
Inthenominative case thepersonal pronoun to
which itrelates isalways placed after it,as
lya tiofe'mi,"themother who loves me," literally,
"the mother who sheloves me." Intheobjective
casetherelative pronoun isgoverned bytheverb, and
thepersonal pronoun isnotrequired. Thus Iija ti
emife, "themother whom Ilove."
(3)Demonstrative pronouns.
These are:—
Eyiyi, eyi,oryi,This. Wonyi, These.
Eyini, eni,ni,orna.That. Wonni, Those.
Eyiyi, eyi,oryi,seems tomean literally "thething
taken," andEyini tobecomposed ofeyi,and eni,
one. Won, isanabbreviation ofawon, they.
The adverbial demonstrative pronouns oftime,
place, andmanner areexpressed by :—
Nighana, then, atthattime {ni,tobe
;igha, time; na,that).
Niliin-yl, here, inthisplace (niha, locality, place;eyi,this).


LANGUAGE. 2(11
Nibe-na, there, inthatplace {nibe, inorataplace; na,that).
Bat, thus, inthismanner (isperhaps acontraction ofba-eyi, tomeet
this).
(4)Interrogative pronouns.
Tani,Who.
Eivo, Which.
The possessive cases aremade byprefixing ti,
"belonging to":—
Ti-tani, Ti-ewo.
Nouns.
Nouns areformed inthefollowing ways :
(1)From theverb, with theprefix i.This prefix
seems toconvey thenotion ofthings regarded collec-
tively, orintheabstract.
Ife,love, willingness, from fe,tolove.
I(ja, height, loftiness,„ga,tohehigh, ortall.

(2)From theverb, with theprefix a.This prefix

tocarry with itasuggestion ofpassiveness, orof
individuality ofthings rather than ofbeings, but
nouns expressing personality arenevertheless some-

(5)From theverb,byreduplication. Thismode is


LANGUAGE. 203
common totheother cognate languages, and ispro-
bably primitive.
(a)Eegular reduplication :—
Fofo, foam, from/o, tofloat.
Nini, owner,„ni,to.possess.
Riri, sight, ri,tosee.
Konrinkonrin, singer„konrin, tosing.
Gbenagbena, carpenter,„ghena, tocarve, work inwood.
(b)Irregular reduplication :—
Mimu, something tobedrunk, frommu,todrink.
TiYo, sufficiency,tobeenough.
Giga, height,tobetall.
Jija, fight, battle,ja,tofight.
Jijin, depth,y,-tobedeep.
(6)Bjprefixing thepersonal pronoun o(lie,she,
orit)toaverb ofpossession, as:—
Onija, antagonist, fighter, from nija{niija), tohave strife,
Onijo, dancer,tohave adance.Om%o, judge„ ,v%o), tohave
judgment.
Where thenioftheverb ofpossession hasbeen
euphonically changed to li,or I,the initial vowel of
theoriginal nounbecomes theprefix ofthenonn of
possession. Thus :—
Alafose diviner, from lafose (ni-afose), tohave divination.Aladngbo, neighbour,„ladvgbo (ni-adugbo), tohave vicinity.
Elekun, mourner,„Mcwn (ni-ekun), tohave grief.
Elegan, slanderer,„legan (nt-egan), tohave slander.
Olowo, richman,„lowo (ni-owo), tohave riches.
Olofo, loser,„hfo, (ni-o/o), tohave loss.
Wemayhereshow thesuccessive changes bywhich

tlienoun ofpossession isformed from tlieprimitive
monosyllabic verb:—
Monosyllabic Verb. Noun.
Ru^tocany. Eru, burden.
Fo,tobeempty. Ofo,emptiness, loss.
Da,tomake. Ida, actofmaking.
Verb ofPossession. Noun ofPossession.
Leru {ni-eru), tohave aburden. Eleru, carrier.
Lofo (ni-ofo), tohave loss. Olofo, loser.
Nida, tohavethemaking. Onida, maker.
(7)Byjoining twonoans, as:—
Ebado, river-side, from eha,brink, edge, andodo, river, brook.
Eyinju, oye-ball, „e^Jin, egg,and oju, eye.
Iboji, grave, „ibi,place, and oji,shade, ghost.
Irinajo, travel, „irin, awalk, and ajo,journey.
(8)Byprefixing a,"not," tonouns commencing
with i.This gives thenotion ofanegative quality
intheabstract. Thus :—
Aife, unwillingness. Ailo, inutility.
From theforegoing itwillbeseen that allnouns
begin with avowel, except those formed byre-
duplication from averb.Afewnounsmaybefound
which appear tobeexceptions tothis rule,buton
investigation they arefound tobeeither :—
(a)Nouns offoreign importation, such asgalas,
east, aHausa word, or
(b)Nouns whose vowel-prefix hasbeen dropped.
Ofthe latter, wefind hoji,agrave;halogun, war-
chief;haluwe, bath-room;bode, custom-house;and,
asweasoften hear iboji asboji,andibalogun asbalo-


LANGUAGE. 205
gun, \TQconclude that hode,andafewofher similar
words, originally hadthevowel-prefix.
Conversely, allwords beginning with avowel are
nouns. Afewwords used asadjectives, adverbs,
orconjunctions, appear atfirstsight tobeexceptions,
butthey areallreally nouns. Thus:—
Abiye, used asanadjective, "-wiugod," really means "something
possessing wings." (^Ahi, something possessing).
Ahila, used toexpress "striped," similarly means "something
possessing stripes."
Ighana, iised toexpress "then," isreally igba (time) andna
(that).
Okpo lohpo, used asanadverb, "plentifully,*' isareduplication of
thenoun okpo, plenty, andmeans literally "plenty-plenty."
Nouns arenotdeclined. Thenoun inthenomina-
tive, orsubjective, case isplaced before theverb, and,
inthe objective, after it.The genitive iseither
expressed, asinEwe,byposition, asHeohonri, house
(ofthe)man, orbymeans of ti,belonging to,as
Hetiokonri, house oftheman.
Theplural isformed byplacing thedemonstrative
pronoun ivonyi (these), orwonni (those), after the
noun, except when anumber isused, inwhich case
thenumber itself, placed after thenoun, sufiiciently
indicates theplural.
There is,properly speaking, nogender inYoruba,
asisshown bythesameword serving forhe,she,or
it.Inthecase ofhuman beings, infants excepted,
sex isindicated bythenouns ohonri (man) andoMri

infants included, itisindicated bytliewords alco(a
male) andabo(afemale), as:—
Ako-malu, bull. Aho-elede, boar.
Aho-malu, cow. Aho-elede, sow.
Akoand abo,when applied toinfants, stand alone,
without being joined toanoun meaning child or
infant.
Adjectives.
Adjectives areexpressed invarious ways.
(1.)Byverbs, as:—
Ga,tobetall. Wo, tobebent.
Mo, tobeclean. Eo,tobesoft.
Yi,tobetough. Te,tobeflat.
These adjectival verbs admit ofcomparison, and
aretheonlywords qualifying nouns that canbe
compared. Thecomparative isformed byadding the
verb ju(tosurpass, bemore than) ;andthesuper-
lative byadding theverb lo(toleave, depart), tothe
comparative. Thecomparative isthus expressed by
a'compound verb ofClass III.,andthesuperlative
byoneofClass V.Example:—
Ga,tobetall.
Ga-ju, tobetaller (tobetall, tosurpass).
Ga-jii, lo,tobetallest (tobetall,tosurpass, toleave).
(2)Byverbs ofpossession, as:—
Nikpara (ni-ikjpara), tohaveharm, expresses harmful.
Ntbo {ni-iho), tohave breadth, „ wide.
Nikpa {ni-ikpa), tohave strength, „powerful.
Laiya (iii-aiya), tohave courage, „ brave.


LANGUAGE. 207
Tliese canalsobeused intlienegative. Tlius:—
Lai-nikpara, nottohaveharm, expresses harmless.
Lai-nibo, nottohave breadth, „ narrow.
Lai-nikpa, nottohave strength,„ powerless.
(3)Bynouns withthenegative particle ai(no,not),
orlai(notbeing), prefixed. Thus:—
Aidaba (aiidaba, nohope) canbeused toexpress hopeless.
Aigbona (aiI'gbona, nowarmth)„ „ cold.
Laidaju (laiidaju, notbeing
certainty)„ „ uncertain.
Laidon (lai idon, notbeing
sweetness)„ „unpleasant.
Theonly adjectives proper arethose formed by
reduplication from averb, ordinarily anadjectival
verb. Examples:—
Wiiuo, bent, crooked, from ivo,tobebent.
Tito, straight,„to,tobestraight.
Lile, hard,„le,tobehard.
Lele, pliant,„le,tobepliant.
Giga, high, tall,„ga,tobehigh ortall,
Dudu, black,,,du,tobeblack.
Kukuru, short,,,Iciiru, tobeshort.
Bum, disordered,,,ru,tostirup,mingle.
Jiiju, confused,,,jic,tosurpass, differ.
Adverbs.
Adverbs areusually expressed byverbs, nouns,
adjectives, orcompounds ofthese, used adverbially.
Theword used asanadverb isalways placed after
theverb orobjective noun. Examples:—
Awhile, foratime, byosa,time, interval oftime.
Before (sooner),„sin,toloadtheway.

-^Qy^^ „niglayi {ni-igha-yi), tohave thistime.
Afterwards" „nighehin (ni-igba-ehm) ,tohave the
time back.
Proudly „ „ j,nirera (ni-irera), tohave pride.
There are,however, anumber ofwords which
appear tobetrueadverbs, butmayonlybeadjectives
used adverbially, since they areallformed byredupli-
cation from verbs. Examples :—
Yara.yara, quickly, from tobequick.
Tutu, entirely, „ toloosen, untile.
Jale-jale, thoroughly, „jale, togothrough.
Fule-fule, softly, „tobesoft.

Scge-sege, unevenly, unequally, „se,tomiss themark, and ge,

Jeje, gently, softly, „tocomply.
Apeculiarity isthatmany adverbs canonly be
usedwith aspecial verb oradjective. There is,of


LANGUAGE. 200
course, some connection between tlieadverb andthe
word itqualifies, wliicli connection wecaninafew
cases discover bjreferring toTshi, Ga,orEwe, but
inothers itremains obscure.
Forexample, take thefollowing adverbs, each of
which canonly berendered inEnglish by"very,"
or"exceedingly."
1.Bin-hiri, very, canonlybeusedwith theverb slm, tobedark, or
gloomy, asoju-orun sliu hiri-biri, "thesky isverygloomy." Here
theconnection isdiscoverable, asthere isinTshi averb, biri, tobe
dark, gloomy, orblack, sothat biri-biri itself would properly mean
"gloomy."
2.Fio-fio, very, canonly beusedwith theverb cja,tobetall,or
with theadjective gicja, tall. This isexplained bytheverbs fro, to
ascend, climb (Tshi);fa,toshoot up(Ga);fo,torise, raise(E^e)
;and/o, tojump, leap(Yomba^, which show that fio-fio, properly means
raised.
3.Rin-rin, very, canonlybeusedwith theverbwuwo, tobeheavy.
As itisareduplication ofrin,tobesaturated, topressdown tothe
ground, theconnection canbeseen.
4.Janjan, very, canonly beused oftheheat ofthesun. Je. is
thesuninEwe.
5.Gara, very, canonly beused with reference totransparency,
clearness
;asamimimo rjara, "very clear water." Thehard"g"is
only asoftened "k,"andwefind ko,tobeclear, pure (E^Ve), and
iron, pure, clear(Ga).
6.Ram-ram, veiy, canonlybeused withtheverb ke,toroar, utter
acryorsound. Ra-ra, loudly, canonlybeusedwith thesame verb.
7.Nini, very, canonlybeused with tutu, tobecold.
8.Dodo, very, canonlybeusedwith ro,toslacken, tocool ardour.
This isperhaps explained bytheverbs de,toslacken (Yoruba)
;do,
toletgo,do,tobegrieved, troubled (EiVe) ;and do,togrant (Ga).
9.Jojo, very, canonly beused with averb ofabundance, as.for
instance, with po,tobemany. Enia pojojo,"the people arcvery
many."
10.Koro, very, canonly l)cused with togothrough. Itis
perhaps from ko,tomeet, and ro,togiveway.
P

Tlienumbers between tlietens areexjDressed on

viz.:from one tofourbyjoining thelower tothe
higher (inthiscasebymeans oftheverb le,toadd),
andfrom fivetoninebydeducting from thetennext
above bymeans oftheverb di.Thus:—
Twenty-one, Ohan-le-ogun (oneadded totwenty).
Twenty-two, Eji-le-ogun (twoadded totwenty).
Twenty-three, Eta-le-ogun (three added totwenty).
Twenty-four, Erin-le-ogun (four added totwenty).

Twenty- seven, Eta-di-loghon (three lessthan thirty).
Twenty-eight, Eji-di-loghon (two lessthan thirty).
Twenty-nine, Okan-di-loghon (one lessthan thirty).
From twohundred upwards theYoruba peoples
reckon bytwohundreds. When thenumber isodd
theysay"Somany twohundreds, lessonehundred,"
and tofacilitate thisprocess theyhave aword ede,
which means "minus onehundred," or"minus one
thousand," according towhether itisused inconnec-
tionwith hundreds orthousands. Twohundred is
tenscore, andcomputation bytwo-hundi^eds isas
natural topeople whoreckon byscores asthatby
hundreds, i.e.,ten tens, istopeople who reckon bv
tens.
Thenumbers from twohundred upwards are,however, ordinarily expressed incowry nomenclature.

Sixhundred isegheta (igbio-eta), three small bundles.
Fivehundred isedegbeta (ede-egbeta), three small bundles mmus
onehundred.
Twelve hundred isegbefa {igbio efa), sixsmall bundles.
Sixthousand isegbata (egba-eta), three large bundles.
Fivethousand isedegbata {ede-egbata), three large bundles mmus
onethousand.
When twenty thousand— onebag— isarrived at,the
computation iscontinued bybags:—
Eighty thousand, oke-merin (bags-four).
Onehundred thousand, Oke-marun (bags-five).
Thissystem ofnumeration isclumsy, andcompares
unfavorably with those evolved bytheTshi, Ga,and
Ewe-speaking peoples, which arevery regular. It
exhibits rather stronger traces oftheprimitive practice
ofcounting byfives, tens,andtwenties— that is,byone
hand, twohands, andhands andfeet— than dothe
other systems. Olcan, one,means "something alone,"
andnodoubt refers tothethumb.* Eji,two, ispro-
bably from ji,topick,andmeans "thepicker,'' that
is,theindex-finger. Thisverbappears again ineje,
seven, which would becounted ontheindex-finger of
theother hand. Eta, three, isfrom theverb ta,to
shoot outlengthwise, andthethird, ormiddle finger,
isthelongest. Erin, four, isseemingly from theverb
rm,togo,progress, andwould mean "theprogress-

ing." Arun, five, isfrom run,tobring toanend, finisli.
Itmeans "theending," and fivebrings toanendthe
counting ofthefingers ofonehand. Bfa, six,which
would becounted onthethumb oftheother hand,
seems tomean "thatwhich leads orattracts," andtobe
from fa,tolead, attract, draw ;andewa, ten, ispro-
bably from theverb lua,tocome together, andrefers
totheclosing ofthetwohands when thecounting is
finished. Thederivation ofejo,eight, anderan, nine,
isnotclear. Then eleven, twelve, thirteen, andfour-
teen arerespectively ten-one, ten-two, ten-three, and
ten-four;butfifteen, which completes thecounting on
onehand, isfive lessthan twenty. Thecomputation
isthen carried totheother hand, andwegetfour less
than twenty, three lessthan twenty, andsoon, till
twenty isreached. From twenty totwohundred the
computation isbyscores, that is,byhands and feet.
Theordinal numbers areformed byprefixing ekon
completion, fulness, generally contracted toe/c'—before
thecardinal numbers, butcomplete tensabove ten,
that is,twenty, thirty, &c.,donottake thisprefix!
Thus:—^
First. Ek-eni. Eleventh. Ek-okanla.
Second. Ek-eji. Twentieth. Ocjun.
Third. Ek-eta.Twenty-first. Ek-okan-le-ocjim.
Tenth. Ek-ewa. Twenty-fiftli. Ek-edoghon.
When answering thequestion "Howmany ?"itis
necessary toprefixmtothecardinal number, exceptmthecase ofone, ten,twenty, thirty, &c. Thus,

ara,usually contracted toe,before thecardinal num-
bers, asused inanswer toaquestion. Thus:—
Once, ekan {ara-lcan).
Twice, emeji {aixi-meji).
Thrice, emeta {ara-meta).
Four times, emerin {ara-merin).
Ara isanoun wliicli hastheprimary meaning of
custom, fashion, butalsomeans arepetition.
Thenumeral adverbs oforder areformed bypre-
fixing theverb lelce, tobeprominent, oruppermost,
abbreviated to lelc before the cardinal numbers.
Thus:—
Firstly, leh-eni.
Secondly, lek-cji.
Thirdly, lek-eta.
From thepreceding itwillhave been seen that, as
inTshi, Ga,andEwe, allthewords inthelanguage
arederived from thesimple monosyllabic verbs. The
listofYoruba simple monosyllabic verbs willbefound
intheAppendix, where thefourlanguages arecom-
pared.
There istheusualwant ofdefiniteness inexpressmg
colours. Fufu means white, orany light colour;
dudu, black, dark blue, dark green, pui^ple, orany
dark colour; and pu:pa, red, scarlet, oryellow.
Colours arethusgrouped into three classes, hght,
dark, and reddish. Toexpress different shades of
colour withexactness recourse ishadtonatural objects.
Thus, grey isexpressed byeru, "ashes "

"colour ofthealuko," abird ofapurplisli liue ;and
yellow bjiyeye, thename ofayellow plum, orby
sJiafa-pupa, literally "faded, scraped, red."
That, inspeaking, thewords should follow one
another inthenatural order inwhich theywould
occur tothemind, iswhat istobeexpected from a
people whohave notinvented anelaborate syntax.
Thus theadjective always follows thenoun, anda
native would say"Handkerchief red," instead of
putting theattribute before thesubject, aswedo,
andsaying "Eedhandkerchief." Similarly they say
"Water bring," instead of"Bring water," and"Cold
blows thewind," or,literally, "Coldness owns the
wind," instead of"Thewind blows cold." Inshort,
thenotion which comes first tothemind isthatwhich
isfirstexpressed.
