There wasafamine, andtherewasagreat scarcity
offood allthrough thecountry.
Onedaythelizard was inaplantation searching
forsomething toeat,when hefound alarge rock full
ofyams.
Theowner oftheplantation wasneartherock. He
cried"Rock, open," andtherock opened. Hewent
inandtookyams, andcame outagain. Then hesaid,
"Rock, shut," andtherock closed up.
The lizard saw allthis.Heheard alsowhat the
man said,andhewenthome.
Next morning, atcock-crow, hewent totherock.
Hesaid, "Rock, open," andtherock opened. He
went inandcarried outyams totakehome and eat.
Then hesaid, "Rock, shut," and therock shut.
Every daythelizard didthis.
awork Ihave not seen, butwliich waswritten byMr.Bowen, an
American Missionary, andpublished atCharleston, United States of
America, in1857. Allnatives areagreed that thisversion isincor-
rect, and that Tortoise was theravisher, and theonly probable
explanation oi:themistake seems tobethatMr.Bowen learnt the
story from anative whospoke French, andeither confused latortue
with letortu, orconcluded thatthenarrator meant thelatter when he
said theformer. Ifthe hearer hadnever heard ofthemythical
personage, theanthropomorphic Tortoise, he,thinking itimpossible
thatBujc could beviolated byatortoise, would very naturally
suppose that thenaiTator meant tosay letortu, anderred through an
insufficient knowledge ofFrench.

Oneday Tortoise, thebald-lieaded elf,met the
lizard ontheroad carrying yams. Hesaid tohim,
"Where didyougetyour foodfrom, comrade ?"
Thelizard said,"IfIwere totellyouthat,andtake
you totheplace, Ishould bekilled." The bald-
headed elfanswered,"No,Iwillnotsayaword to
anyone. Please take me." And thelizard said,
"Yery well, then; come and callmeto-morrow
morning atcock-crow, andwewillgotogether."
Next morning, longbefore cock-crow. Tortoise came
tothehouse ofthe lizard. Hestood outside the
house and cried"Cock-a-doodle-do."*Again he
cried"Cock-a-doodle-do." Then hewent inand
woke thelizard. "Thecockhascrowed," hesaid.
"Letmesleep," said thelizard; "it isnotyet
cock-crow.""Yery well," saidTortoise. And they
bothwent tosleep tillcock-crow.
Then thelizard gotup,andthetwowent together.
Assoon asthey arrived attheplace thelizard said,
"Rock, open," and therock opened. The lizard
went in,tookyams, andcame outagain.
Hesaid toTortoise, "Itistime togo.Take your
yams andcome." "Wait aminute," said Tortoise.
"Yery well," saidthe lizard. "Eock, shut." And
hewentaway without waiting.
Tortoise, thebald-headed elf,helped himself to
yams. Heputyams onhisback andyams onhis
head; heputyams onhisarms andyams onhis
legs.
