The parallel between this taleandthechangeling
stories ofISForthern Europe isclose. Inthelatter,
asintheYoruba version, thechangeling, while inthe
presence ofitsfoster-mother andothers, affects tobe
aninfant, butthrows offhisdisguise assoon ashe
imagines himself tobealone. See,forinstance, the
tale called "The Father ofEighteen Elves," in
Arnason's collection ofIcelandic legends.* Theonly
difference—animportant one, itistrue—isinthe
genesis ofthechangehng. InEurope itisanelfin
child,who issubstituted forastolenhuman child, but
here itisthechild himself who ispossessed byan
evil spirit, justasanAbika possesses achild, though
with different results.
Wealsofindasuperstition which recalls that ofthe
were-wolf, forthehyena (Kpelekpe) isoften supposed
tobeamanwhoassumes that disguise atnight, to
preyupon sheep and cattle, and, iftheopportunity
offers, uponhuman beings. Such man-hyenas are
believed tobeable,bymeans ofcertain howls and
cries, tocompel people togoouttothem inthedark
forest tobedevoured. Asimilar belief isfound in
Abyssinia.t Theweird "laugh" ofthehyena, and
itsnocturnal habits, nodoubt account forthissuper-
stition, justassimilar causes have ledtotheowlbeing
universally regarded asabird ofillomen.

Thestory runs thatapoorwoman, named lyewa, had
twochildren, whom shehadahard struggle tosup-

theforest togather firewood, which shecarried tothe
town and sold forfood. One day,when following
hercustomary avocation, sheandthechildren, finding
wood scarce, wandered further intotheforest than
usual, and,when itwastime toreturn, they could not
findtheirway out.They walked hither andthither
looking forthepath, butinvain, and atlast, tired
outandtormented with thirst, they laydown torest
under alarge tree. This rested their limbs, but
their thirst increased, and thetwo children filled
theforest with their lamentations, crying totheir
mother forwater. The poor woman, half dis-
tracted, sprang toher feet,andagain searched in
every direction forthepathandforwater, but fruit-

trating herself upon theearth, shecalled upon the
gods tocome toherassistance andsaveherchildren.
