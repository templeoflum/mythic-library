All tliebirds came. They settowork, andthey
cleared alarge piece ofground.
Inthemiddle ofthepiece ofground wasanodan-
tree.* Atmid-day, when thesmiwas hot,and all
thebirds had left theirwork fortheday, kini-kini
came andperched ontheodan-tvQQ, andbegan to
sing :—
"Theking sent toinvitemycompanions,

Next morning, when thebirds came towork, they
found theground theyhadcleared allgrown over
with gra.ss andbush. They went andtoldtheking.
Theking said, "That isnothing ;clear itagain."

Thebirdswent toworkandcleared itagain, andat
mid-day went away. Tlie kini-Jcini came back and
sang hissong again, andagain thegrass andbush
sprang up.
Next daythe birds, when theysawwhat had
happened, went and informed the king. "No
matter," saidtheking, "clear theground again."
Athird timethebirds cleared theground andwent
away, andathird time thekini-hini cameandsang
sothatthegrass andbush sprang up.
Thenext day,when thebirds found theground
covered with bush, theywent totheking. They
asked theking togivethem authority toseize the
person whohadplayed this trick. Theking said,
"Yery well."
Then allthebirds wentback tothepiece ofground;
they putagreat quantity ofbirdlime onthe oclo.n-
tree ;thentheywenthome.
Next morning theycame andcleared theground
again, and atmid-day went andhid inthebush
close by.
TheJdni-ldni came andperched ontheodan. He
sang hissong, andthegrassandbushgrew up.Then
hewanted toflyaway, buthefound himself heldby
thebirdlime.
Then allthebirds flocked tothetreeandsawthe
kini-Jchii. They seized himandbrought him tothe
king. They said totheking, "Behold theonewho
hascaused iissomuch trouble."
Thekingmade the Jdni-ldni come near. "What
have Idone toyou," heasked, "thatyoushould act
thus ?"TheJdni-ldni said, "When you called all

mycompanions toclear theground you leftmeout,
therefore Ihaverevenged myself."
When theking heard this, heraised hishand to
givetheJdni-ldni aslap.
"Pardon, pardon," said theIdni-lmii. "IfIfind
anycowries Iwill givethem toyou.When Iget
anykola-nuts Iwillbring them toyou."
Theking gave thebird aslap,andthekini-ldni
voided outcowries tilltheroomwas filled.
"What isthis ?"saidtheking,much astonished,
andheraised hishand again togive thekini-Tdni a
slap.
"Ibegpardon," said thebird. "IfIfindany
cowries Iwill givethem toyou.When Igetany
kola-nuts Iwillbring them toyou."
Thekinggavehimaslap,andtheJdni-ldni voided
from hisbody stillmore cowries than thefirsttime.
Theking sentmessengers through allthecountry,
andsummoned allhispeople toassemble onthe fifth
day, toseeamarvel. Allthepeople promised to
come.
Then theking putthekini-kini inabasket. He
covered thetopofthebasket andwent out. His
little son,whowanted togivethekini-kini aslap
himself, uncovered thebasket, and thebird flew
away.
When thekingcamehome hewent tothebasket.
Hefound nobird in it,andhecalled hisson.
"Where isthekini-kini ?"heasked.
.The little boyanswered thathehadgone toplay

Allthebirds flocked round, andeach danced in

todance, the kini-kini didnotwant todance.
Allthe birds begged him todance, but he
refused.
Then theboyplayed quicker onthedrum. He

Atlastthekini-kini began toyield. Hetwisted

Heturned here and twisted there. Heturned,

other birds flewaway.
Theboybrought thekini-kini tohisfather. "I

"Wenowcome tothose taleswhich maybecalled
"Tortoise Stories," since thetortoise {aivon) always
plays aleading part inthem. The tortoise has, in
these tales, various superhuman powers attributed
tohim, and, inmost, isdescribed asacting craftily
ormischievously. He,infact, fills inthefolk-lore
tales oftheSlave Coast theplace ofthespider
{anansi) inthetales oftheGrold Coast, andwhich
areinconsequence known asAnansi 'sem {Anansi
asem), "Spider Stories." Inthese thespider is
always depicted asshowing great skilland craft,
and, liketheminor gods, isrepresented asspeaking-
through thenose.
Thenames Tortoise andSpider areinthese stories
used astheproper names ofanthropomorphic per-
sonages, andamong theTshi tribes thelatter iscalled
Aj'ija Anansi, "Father Spider," or"Father Anansi."
Thus, theYoruba proverbial saying, EjiAwon hoIcon
niliowo,used toconvey themeaning that amatter
which atfirst sight appears insignificant may really
beoneofgreat importance, should notbetranslated
"Theblood ofthetortoise isnotahandful "(literally,
"does not fillahand "),but"theblood ofAivon"
(themythical personage, oranthropomorphic tortoise)
"isnotahandful." Anepithet ofthetortoise is
ajajja, "bald-headed elf," or"hairless elf"{aja, elf;
pa,tobebald orbare). Theflickering appearance

fire," and isbelieved tobecaused byasubterranean

firemadebjthetortoise todestroy tlieroots oftrees.
The tortoise appears inseveral proverbial sayings,
as"The tortoise (orAwon) isalways thesubject of
analo"(tale), and"Thehouse ofthetortoise isnot
largeenough foritself. Theverandah "(that is,that
part oftheshellwhich projects over the tail) "of
atortoise will notaccommodate aguest. The
tortoise, having built itshouse, makes theverandah
behind it;"while"As thetortoise meets with due
regard, soalsoshould the snail," seems toindicate
thatthetortoise isregarded withreverence orrespect.
Itispossible thattotemism liesattheroot ofthese
phenomena. OntheGold Coast there isatradition
that allmankind aredescended from Anansi, andon
theSlave Coast thefigure ofthetortoise isfrequently
seencarved onthedoors oftemples, together with the
leopard, serpent, andafish.Onthewhole, however,
itseems more probable that thepeculiarities which
make thespider andthetortoise each initsownway
remarkable, have ledtotheir selection forthechief
role inthepopular fables. The tales being largely
about animals, those creatures which most excited
wonder andspeculation intheminds ofthenatives
would betheones towhich themost wonderful
attributes would beascribed;and, inthecase ofthe
spider, theingenuity andpatience displayed byitin
theconstruction ofitswebwould beattributed tothe
anthropomorphic spider ofthe stories. There isat
thepresent time nospider-clan among thetotem-
clans oftheGold Coast, and, asthecommunities
ofthe G-old Coast areheterogeneous, Avecannot
suppose thatanentire clanhasbecome extinct, unless

theextinction took place intheremote pastwhen
communities were homogeneous ;inwhich case
there seems nosufficient reason forthememory of
thetotem-ancestor being preserved, after the dis-
appearance ofallthose whowere supposed tobe
descended from him.
