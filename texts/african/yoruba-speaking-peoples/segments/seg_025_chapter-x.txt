CHAPTER X.
SYSTEM OEGOVEENMENT.
The monarcliical system ofgovernment prevailsm
most oftheYoruba tribes, bnt tlieking ismerely
tlienominal liead oftlie state, and lias little real
power, wliicli remains inthehands ofthe chiefs
and elders, without whom theking candonothing.
Ineach state there isacouncil ofelders, without
whose concurrence theking can issue noedict,
and atwo-thirds' majority ofwhich isrequired
foranynew law. The sovereignty ofastate is
hereditary inonefamily, buttheindividual who is
tosucceed tothe office isselected bythe council.
Themonarchy isthus elective, though onlymen
ofacertain blood-descent arequalified forelection.
The council ofelders, besides electing aking,
controls hisactions, and, should heshow any dis-
position tomake himself independent ofit,invites
him to"go tosleep," bysending himapresent of
parrots' eggs. Theking isnever allowed tosee
foreigners without some members ofthecouncil
being present, and all his actions are closely
watched. The king and thecouncil make laws
and decide allordinary affairs, but, should any
question ofvital importance tothenation arise,


SYSTEM OFGOVERNMENT.1G5
thewhole people isassembled for itsdiscussion
andsettlement;andevery individual, regardless of
position, isallowed toexpress hisopinion. Theemblem ofroyalty isaconical head-dress ofbeads,
from which hang long strings ofbeads, soarranged
astoconceal theface ofthewearer. Anepithet
applied tokings isalaiye, "Owner oftheWorld."
The election ofaking ispreceded byacurious
ceremony. When the council has selected the
mdividual who istosucceed tothe throne, the
chiefs and elders proceed tohishouse ontheday
fixed forthecoronation, seize him suddenly, and
forcibly convey him tothepalace, where they floo-himvigorously with light whips. Ifheshould cryoutduring thepunishment, orshow any signs ofpam, heisatonce rejected asunworthy, andthe
council makes anew choice;but ifhebearhimself
bravely, without flinching, heisforthwith crowned.
This^ ordeal appears tobedesigned totest the
candidate's capacity forendurance, and hispowersofself-restraint andconcealment ofthought. Anexactly similar practice isfound among theTimnis
ofSierra Leone, who, ontheday ofelection, scoff
atandbeat thenewking while dragging himfrom
hisownhouse totheresidence ofhispredecessor•
where, ifhehaswithstood the ordeal, theroyalornaments areputonhim.
The chief officers ofstate aretheBashorun, orprime minister, thechief adviser ofthekino-whohasthe title ofEmeiva (Eni-mo-ewa), "Hewhoknows themind;" andtheBalog^m (Oha-ni-ogun),
or"Chief oftheArmy." The military officer

second incommand, isstyled the Berild. Next to
these high officials come the civil governors of
towns {Bale *),each ofwhom exercises rule inhis
own domain. The Bales oftowns correspond to
the chiefs ofdistricts among theTshi tribes, and,
asintheir case, theking ofthenation isthe
Bale ofhisown capital. Under theBales of
towns aretheBales oftown -quarters and villages,
andunder these again aretheBales ofhouseholds.
The Bale ofahousehold isresponsible forthe
preservation oforder inthegroup ofdwellings
occupied bjhisfamily anddependents. Hesettles
allminor disputes between those under hiscontrol,
but ifthematter involves thesubordinates ofanother
household-5aZe, itistaken before theBale ofthe
town-quarter, who isresponsible forpeace andorder
within that area. Ifitbeanordinary "palaver,"
thisfunctionary settles it,but ifitbeserious hemust
refer ittotheBale ofthetown. Unless the affair
concerns another district also, orisofnational im-
portance, itneed gonofurther, forinhisown
domain thetown-5aZe isalmost independent. Persons
subject toaBale address him asBaba, "Father," or
"Master," andheinturn callsthem "mychildren."
Inevery town there is,besides theBale, anlyalode
(lya-ni-ode), "Mistress ofthe street," towhom all
disputes between women arebrought inthe first
instance, onlythose which she isunable todeal with
being referred tothe Bale. The lyalode has as
coadjutors anOton-iyalode (right-hand lyalode) and
anOsin-iyalode (left-hand lyalode).

Members ofcouncil andtown-Bales are Oloris,
"chiefs," andform thearistocracy. Every Olori has
inhisservice certain mentermed Onses, who actas
messengers, heralds, bailiffs, and police, and, ata
pinch, asexecutioners. Aking's Onse iscalled an
Ilari, whence theproverb, "As nosubject, however
rich,mayhaveanIlari, soitisnoteverymanwho
mayownapalace."
Respect tokings andchiefs isshown byprostration,
followed byrising andclapping thehands. Before
entering thepresence ofaking orchief, thecloth
isremoved from theshoulder, overwhich itisusually
worn, andwrapped round thewaist. When anew
title isconferred onamanaleaf oftheaJcolco-tree is
given totherecipient asasign ofhonour. All

Theforegoing applies generally toalltheYoruba

InYoruba proper theking isstyled theAlafin,
andhiseldest son, called theAremo (Are-ommo, eldest
child), governs conjointly with him. Under anold
custom, theAremo was obliged tocommit suicide

The tailofawhite-bellied rat, called Afe-imojo (Rat

royalty, andwhen hewalks abroad heholds ittohis

InYoruba the office ofBasliorun ishereditary in
one family, butthe Alafin, incouncil, selects the
member tofill it.Heisobliged bylaw toreside in
Oyo, thecapital. Next inrank totheBasliorun is
theAre-Onalcalanfo, "First oftheWar- Captains,"
whocanbeselected fromanyfamily and livewhere
hepleases. The council consists oftwenty-two
members, and iscalled Isolcan (agreement, concord,
orunanimity) ;theleader ofthecouncil isstyled the
Onasohan,"Channel totheConcord."
TheBaris arethe confidential advisers ofthe
Alafin, andareofeither sex,thefemales being chosen
fromamong hiswives. Ilaris, whether male or
female, shave thehead, leaving asmall tuft, ortail,on
thecrown. Inaddition tothese, theAlafin hasa
number ofcourt-officials termed Bafin, orIbafin, a
wordwhich seems tomean "Inmates ofthePalace."
Six ofthem, called theBvefa {Iwe-eja) "the six
papers," arechamberlains, theremainder arespies, or
intelligence-officers, whokeep theAlafin informed of
everything thattakes place. The chief chamberlain
isstyled theOna-iwefa, andthetwonext inrank, the

Among allthetribes therevenues ofthekings, chiefs,
andhales oftowns arederived from tribute paidbythe
dependent villages, andfrom duties levied upon goods
andnative productions brought intothetowns. These
duties arecollected byofficers called Oni-bodes, and
arelevied atcustom-houses [bode) atthegates of
towns, and alsoontheroads atthefrontiers. The
names oftwofrontier towns oftheancient kingdom
ofYoruba, where duties used tobepaid, butAvhich
have long since been destroyed, are stillpreserved in

Osin alasa, thechief, right-hand, andleft-hand alasa.
Inbattle themain bodies oppose each other ata

detachments from thevarious contingents. These
detachments skirmish, keeping attheextreme range
oftheir muskets, andhold their ground without ad-
vancing, tilltheir ammunition isexhausted, when
they retire formore. Theskirmishers arenever re-
inforced from themain body, andordinarily theday
passes without anydecisive result. Sometimes, how-
ever,when theskirmishers ofonearmy retire to

lawsandcustoms.
(1)Laws relating toKinship andInheritance.
We find agreat change from thecustoms oftlie
other tribal groups ofthisfamily ofnations, inthe
Yoruba manner oftracing descent and blood-rela-
tionship ;descent andconsanguinity being nolonger
reckoned exclusively inthefemale line,with succes-
siontochiefdom, office, andproperty from brother to
brother, andthen tosister's son ;butinthemale line,
asfarassuccession todignities isconcerned, andon
both sides ofthehouse forblood-descent. The
Yoruba family—using theword family asmeaning a
group ofpersons whoareunited byties ofblood—is
thus quite adifferent organisation tothatwhichwe
found existing among theTshiandEwe tribes, where
afamily consists solely ofpersons who areconnected
byuterine ties,and inwhich, astwopersons ofthe
same bloodmaynotmarry, thefather isnever related
byblood tohischildren, and isnotconsidered asbe-
longing tothefamily. IntheTshiandEwe tribes
theclan-name isthetest ofblood-relationship, andas
property follows thelaws ofblood-descent, itensues
thatproperty never goes outoftheclan;for,with


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 176
descent intliefemale line, afamily isonly asmall
circle ofpersons, allofwliom bear tliesame clan-
name, within thelarger circle oftheclan itself.
Among theYoruba tribes theblood-tie between
father andchild hasbeen recognised, andtheresult
ofthisrecognition hasbeen theinevitable downfall
oftheclan-system, which isonly possible solong as
descent istraced solely ononeside ofthehouse, as
may bereadily shown. Since twopersons ofthe
same clan-name may, under theclan-system, never
marry, itfollows thathusband andwifemust beof
different clans. Letussaythatone isaDogandthe
other aLeopard. Theclan-name isextended toall
who areofthesame blood;therefore, directly the
blood-relationship between father andchildcomes to
beacknowledged, thechildren ofsuch apair aswe
have supposed, instead ofbeing, asheretofore, simply
Leopards, would beDog-Leopards, andwould belong to
two clans. They intheir turnmight marry with
persons similarly belonging totwo clans, sayCat-
Snakes, and theoffsprings ofthese unions would
belong tofour clans. Theclan-system thusbecomes
altogether unworkable, because, asthenumber of
clans islimited andcannot beadded to,iftheclan
name stillremained thetestofblood-relationship and
abar tomarriage, theresult inafewgenerations
would bethatnomarriages would bepossible. Con-
sequently theclan-name ceases tobethetest ofcon-
sanguinity, kinship istraced insome other way,and
theclan-system disappears;or,asappears tohave
been occasionally thecase, descent isboldly trans-
ferred intothemale line,andmarriage inthefather's


176 TEEYOBTJBA-SFEAKING PEOPLES.
clan isprohibited, tliafc oftliemother being ignored.
TheYornbas haveadopted what appears tohavebeen
theusual course, andblood-relationship isnowtraced
bothonthefather's andonthemother's side, asfar
asitcanberemembered, andmarriage within the
known circle ofconsanguinity isforbidden.
Wlien weconsider theextraordinary vitality the
system ofdescents through mothers possesses, solong
asitisundisturbed byforeign influence, itseems
probable thattheacknowledgment ofafather's blood-
relationship tohischildren wasbrought about bythe
intercourse ofthenorthern Yorubas with theMoham-
medan tribes ofthe interior. That theYorubas
formerly hadthesystem offemale descents isshown
byanancient proverb, which says,"The esuo (gazelle),
claiming relationship with the elculu (alarge ante-
lope), says hismother wasthedaughter ofanehulu."
Ifthemale system ofdescents hadbeen invogue
when thisproverb wasinvented, theesuowould have
beenmade tosaythat hisfather wasthesonofan
elculu. Moreover, inspite ofthelegal succession from
father tosons, children bydifferent mothers, butthe
same father, arebymany natives still scarcely con-
sidered true blood-relations.
Itisnodoubt inconsequence ofthechange from
kinship inthefemale linetokinship onboth sides of
thehouse that thefamily hasbecome, toacertain
extent, disintegrated. OntheGold Coast, where the
uterine family istheonlyoneknown, thefamily is
collectively responsible forthecrimes orinjuries to
person orproperty committed byany ofitsmem-
bers,andeachmember isliable foraproportion of


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 177
tliecompensation tobepaid. Similarly, eachmember
ofthefamily isentitled toashare ofthecompensation
received forinjury totheperson orproperty ofoneof
themembers. Thehead ofthefamily can, ifthe
necessity should arise, pawn, andinsome cases sell,
ajunior member;while, ontheother hand, thejunior
members have aright tobefedandclothed bythe
head ofthefamily. Among theYoruba tribes there
isnocollective responsibility inafamily, except that
parents areresponsible forcrimes committed bytheir
children;thehead ofthefamily cannot pawn the
younger members, andthelatter cannot claim, asa
matter ofright, tobesupported byhim.
When aman dies hissons divide allhisproperty
between them. Thedaughters have noinheritance
intheir father's house, butthey divide between them
theproperty oftheir mother, forhere, aswith the
Tshi, Ga,andEwe tribes, theproperty ofawife is
always separate and distinct from that ofherhus-
band. Ifamanhavenosons hisproperty falls to
hisbrothers, or, ifhehavenobrothers, tohissisters.
From these laws ofinheritance there isnodeparture,
andamancannot disinherit alegal heir.Aman can,
within certain limits, giveaway projoerty during his
lifetime, provided itispurely personal, andnotfamily
property;buthecannot make awill, oranyarrange-
ment for itsdisposal after hisdeath. Succession to
property entails theobligation ofdefraying thedebts
ofthedeceased.
Theterms used toexpress relationship arevery
indefinite, andcanbe,and are,used notonly torela-
tions, buteven tostrangers, asterms ofaddress.

Thissystem iswhat the lateMr.Morgan termed
theclassificatory system ofrelationships, and,onthe
assumption thattheterms usedwere from their very
inception devised toexpress actual degrees ofblood-
relationship, heendeavoured toshow that thehuman
family hadpassed through regular stages ofpeculiar
types ofmarriage.* But itappears certain that
these terms were originally terms ofaddress topersons
ofdifferent grades, being probably designed toshow
therelative positions oftheindividuals composing
thegroup orcommunity, andhadnothing whatever
todowith consanguinity. AstheYorubas trace
descent onboth sides ofthe house, they might,
assuming thattheterms didimply blood-relationship,

ourselves say"uncle"
;buttheTshiandGatribes,
whotrace descent solely through themother, equally
have this classificatory system, andalsouseoneand
thesameterm torelations onthefather's sideoron
themother's. That istosay, these tribes usethese
terms indifferently toblood-relations and topersons
who, according totheir system ofconsangumity,
arenotrelations atall ;andtheconclusion isthat
theterms oftheclassificatory system donotprimarily
imply consanguinity, whatever theymaycome to
mean afterwards.
The lack ofprecision intheterms usedbythe
Yorubas toexpress relationships would atfirst sight
seem toshow that they,andother raceswho follow
theclassificatory system, donotlaymuch stress upon
blood-relationship, themore especially asthey use
thesame terms both toconsanguinei and topersons
who arenotakin ;butthefactappears tobethatthe
classificatory system isatfirstalways combined with
theclan-system, and astheclan-name isthetest
ofconsanguinity, precision interms ofaddress isnot
really ofmuch moment. After theclan-system breaks
down, andtheclan-name ceases tobethe test,some
other mode ofdenoting blood-relationship becomes
necessary ;and itseems probable that itisunder the
stress ofthese new circumstances that theterms
formerly applied towhole grades arenarrowed in
their application tothehousehold circle, andnew
descriptive terms, such asuncle, nephew, and cousin,
areinvented todefine theremoter degrees ofcon-
sanguinity. Inthis connection wemay note that

butthere isnoobjection tohiswaiving hisright

Thejunior wives arecalled lyawo (lyaowo), "Trade-

Grirls ofthe better classes arealmost always
betrothed when mere children, frequently when
infants, thehusband mfuturo being sometimes a
grown manandsometimes aboy. Betrothal con-
fersupon themale allthe rights ofmarriage
except consummation, which takes place shortly
after thegirl arrives atpuberty. Since theearly
age ofbetrothal makes ante-betrothal unchastity a
physical impossibility, theabsence oftheprimitise
when themarriage isconsummated proves that the
girlhasbeen unchaste after betrothal, that is,after
thehusband infuturo hadacquired anexclusive right
toherperson, andconsequently hehasaright to
repudiate her. Insuch acasehemaydismiss her,
sending afewbroken cowries tohermother, andthe
girl's family must return theamount paid forher,
andthevalue ofallpresents made ;but itismore
usual toeffect some compromise.
In thiscustom ofinfant orchild-betrothals we
probably find thekey tothat curious regard for
ante-nuptial chastity found not onlyamong the
tribes ofthe G-old and Slave Coasts, but also
among many other uncivilised peoples indifferent
parts oftheworld ;andwhich certainly cannot be
attributed toanyfeeling ofdelicacy, since husbands
lend their wives without theleast compunction, and
often merely asasign offriendliness. In"West
Africa virginity inabride isnotvalued j?er se,but

because itisaproof that thebetrothed hasnotin-
fringed theexclusive marital i^rivileges ofthehusband
infuturo ;andnon-virginity inabride isonly a
valid ground forrepudiation when the girlhasbeen
betrothed atatender age,forunbetrothed girlscan
bestow their favours uponwhom they please. Thus,
nomanwho marries agirlwithout early betrothal
feelsaggrieved ifsheshould prove nottobeavirgin,
foruntil she ismarried orbetrothed she isperfectly
free,andmistress ofherown actions.
G-irls ofthelower classes, whoareseldom betrothed,
canleadany lifethey choose without incurring re-
proach, andwithout affecting their future prospects
ofmarriage ;but girls oftheupper classes, whoare
almost always betrothed, must bechaste. If,then,
thegreat majority ofgirlswere betrothed inchild-
hood, itmay readily beconceived that anotion might
beformed thatabride ought tobeavirgin, andbe
made ofgeneral application quite independent of
betrothals. Atpresent, thefeeling ofannoyance,
which aYoruba bridegroom experiences when hefinds
that hisbride hasbeen unchaste, isnotduetojealousy
orsentiment, buttoasense ofinjury, because his
rights acquired bybetrothal have been trespassed
upon; butnodoubt, incourse oftime, thesentimental
grievance would beproduced. Whether this feeling
everextends tothelowest classes isuncertain, butat
allevents ithasscarcely yetdone soinEurope.
Agreat deal ofevidence might beadduced toshow
that thecustom ofchild-betrothal leads tovirginity
being expected inabride, and itsabsence being
reo-arded asajustground forrepudiation. InNew


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 185
Zealand, girlswere occasionally betrothed ininfancy,
and inthat casehad tobechaste ;but girls not
betrothed inchildhood were allowed, ongrowing up,
tobestow their favours onwhom they pleased.* In
FijiandSamoa itappears that onlythedaughters of
chiefs wereexpected tobevirgins when married, and
itwasonly thedaughters ofchiefs whowere be-
trothed early inlife.f TheMosquito Indians betroth
children, and if,when themarriage takes place, the
girl isnotavirgin, thematch isbroken off. Similar
evidence isforthcoming inregard totheBagas, Fulas,
Timnis, andFans, inAfrica, theKirghese andOuz-
beks, inAsia,andmany others.
Parents cannot force adaughter tomarry asuitor

(3)Land Laws.
Land belongs tothecommunity collectively, and is
vested inthe chief, who distributes itamongst
households and families asrequired. Noman can
bedispossessed oflandonce allotted tohim,andthe
usufruct descends tohischildren, buttheland cannot
besold. Thelandbeing more than sufficient for all
requirements, thiscommunal system presents no
difficulties, aspractically everybody canhave asmuch


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 189
asliewishes tocultivate. Wlien laud goes outof
cultivation, and isallowed tobeovergrown withbush
orforest, itreverts tothecommunity.
OntheGold Coast private property inland isnot
recognised, andthesaleorpurchase ofland isun-
known, except when Europeans orAnglicised natives
desire toacquire landed property, inwhich case
theconsent ofthecommunity asawhole tothe
transaction has tobeobtained. Among theYoruba
tribes, however, thenotion that land,andnotmerely
itsusufruct, maybetheproperty oftheindividual,
instead ofthecommunity, isbeginning toappear,
forachief can sellorgiveaway land. Noonebuta
chief can sellland ;itisone oftheprerogatives of
chieftainship ;buttheland soldorgiven away must
beunoccupied waste-land, theusufruct ofwhich has
notbeen yielded toanymember ofthecommunity.
When, under thiscustom, land isgiven, theowner-
ship isnotcomplete, forthough theindividual or
family which receives itcanretain itanduse itfor
ever, itcannot bedisposed oftoanythird party.
Land acquired bypurchase becomes theabsolute
property ofthepurchaser. Thepurchase ofland
does not,however, carry with ittheownership of
anything ontheland, such astrees, crops, orhouses,
which stillremain theproperty ofthevendor, unless
sold separately. Houses canouly besoldbyper-
mission oftheking orchief, and, asthey arefamily
property, theconsent ofthewhole family hastobe
obtained tothetransaction.

(4)Laws ofDebt.
Amancanbeimprisoned fordebt, and inevery
town ofimportance there isadebtor's prison {Ile-
emu, bouse ofseizure), inwbicb tbeBale confines
adebtor tilltbedebt isdischarged .There isalsoa
custom similar toourputting aman inpossession,
abailiff's ofiicer, called ogo,being placed inthe
debtor's house toenforce payment.
Amanwhocauses theordinary funeral-rites tobe
performed over another, thereby becomes responsible
for allthedebts ofthedeceased, unless hefirst
obtains permission from thecreditors. The creditors
nearly always consent upon therelations becoming
collectively responsible forthedischarge ofthedebt;
but ifthey refuse permission, andnoone iswilling
toaccept theresponsibility, thecorpse isplaced ona
raised platform ofwattles outside thetown, and
remains there tillthedebt ispaid. This seldom
occurs, except inthecase ofastranger, asthe
omission tobury reflects thegreatest disgrace upon
thefamily concerned.
Aman isresponsible foranydebts hiswivesmay
contract, butnotforthose contracted byhischildren.
(5)Criminal Laws.
When there isnot sufficient evidence toestablish
theguilt ofanaccused, hehastoprove hisinnocence by
"drinking orisha," that is,heissubjected toanordeal,


LAWSANDCUSTOMS. 191
or,inother words, liuman means Having failed, thebur-
denofadecision isthrown upon thegods. Thedraught,
which isnearly always adecoction ofodtim-hark, is
prepared byapriest, whothushas itinhispower to
make itharmless oreffective. Itisapowerful poison,
and ifnotatonce rejected bythestomach, asoften
happens, causes death, inwhich case theorisha is
considered tohave declared hisguiltbyslaying him.Aguiltyman does notdare to"drink orisha;' but
theinnocent willsubmit totheordeal without fear,
and, indeed, frequently demand itinorder toprove
their innocence, whence itfollows that itisthe
guiltless whoordinarily perish.
Asarule,murder, arson, andtreason arepunished
with death.Afirst offence oftheft ispunished by
flogging andafine, asecond bymutilation, anda
third bydeath. When, however, cattle orsheep-
steahng, becomes prevalent, adetected thief isputto
death, asawarning toothers. Insuch acase, the
criminal, instead ofbeing executed bytheOgboni in
secret, isdecapitated onOgun's stool, bythesword-
bearers ofthechiefs, insome public place. Criminals
who cannot pay their fines areflogged with the
Jc^ashan, aformidable whip made ofhippopotamus-
hide,which draws blood ateach stroke.
Therelatives ofaperson whohasbeen executed
forcrime arenotentitled toburyhimwithout paying
ransom forthebody, which, asinthecase ofaman
dying indebt, isplaced onaplatform ofsticks
outside thetown, until theransom ispaid.
