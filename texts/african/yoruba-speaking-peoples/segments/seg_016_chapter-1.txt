The portion oftlieWest African coast occnpiecl by
tlieYoruba-speaking peoples issituated intheeastern

recent times conquered andannexed theYoruba
province ofIlorin, andwhose territory maynowbe
saidtoextend southward toabout 8°30'N.latitude.

The aggressions oftliese Moliammedan tribes com-
menced very early intliepresent century, and itwas
nodoubt tliispressure from thenorth thatcaused the
Yorubas tomove tothesouth and colonise thesea-
board.
Yoruba country atpresent comprises thefollowing
states, orpolitical units:—
(1)TheBritish colony ofLagos, which covers the
whole sea-front between themeridian oftheAjarra
Creek andtheBenin Eiver, andhasabsorbed the
former native kingdoms ofAppa, Pokra, Badagry,
Lagos, Palma, Lekki, Mahin, Ogbo, andJakri.
(2)Ketu. This isthewestern state. Itisbounded
onthewestbyDahomi, onthesouth byPorto Novo,
andontheeastbyEgba. Itsnorthern limits are
undefined.
(3)Egba. Itlieseast ofKetu andsouth-west of
Yoruba proper. Itscapital isAbeokuta, "Under the
Rock."
(4)Jebu. This isthesouth-eastern kingdom, and
isdivided intotwoprovinces, called JebuRemo and
Jebu Ode. JebuOdehasfor itscapital atown of
thesame name, that ofJebuRemo iscalled Ofiin.
The riverOdoOmi isconsidered thenorth-western
boundary ofJebu, and,roughly speaking, theterritory
oftheJebusmaybesaid toextend inland toadistance
ofsome fiftymilesfrom thelagoon.
(5)Ekiti Tribes. These tribes, which form acon-
federation, lietothenorth-east ofJebu Ode.
(6)Ibadan. Itliesnorth ofJebu Ode.
(7)Yoruba proper. Thiskingdom, whose capital
isOyo, liestothenorth ofIbadan andEgba, and


INTRODUCTORY.3
towards thewest itsboundary trends southward to
within some twenty-five miles ofAbeokuta.
(8)Ijesa, capital Ilesa. This state issituated to
thesouth-east ofYoruba proper.
(9)Ife,capital ofthesame name, liessouth-west
ofIjesa.
(10) Ondo. Thiskingdom, capital Ondo, issitu-
atedsouth-east ofIfe.
Inaddition there areseveral small states, orrather
mdependent townships, consisting ofatown anda
fewoutlying villages. The principal areBgbado,
Okeodan, Ado, Awori, andIgbessa, allofwhich lie
south ofEgba. Their inhabitants areEgbados, or
Southern Egbas {IJgba-odo, Egbas ofthecoast).
Theinhabitants ofallthese states speak onelan-
guage, theYoruba. They arecalled ISTagos bythe
French, andbytheEnglish arenamed after their
political divisions, asEgbas, Ibadans, Jebus, &c.
Thelagoon system, which inthelastvolume ofthis
series wasnoted ascommencing ashort distance to
thewest oftheYolta River, ontheGold Coast,
extends along thewhole sea-front oftheterritory
occupied bytheYoruba-speaking tribes, andaffords
acontmuous waterway from Porto JN'ovo toBenin.Theextension ofthecontinent inasoutherly direction,
which wasmentioned inthelastvolume astypical of
thewestern half oftheSlave Coast, andwhich may
doubtless beattributed totheaction oftheGuinea

tion,being tliickly forested ;but itappears tliat less
territory liasbeenwonfrom theseasouth ofJebu,
andeast ofLagos generally, than inthedistricts to
thewest, between Lagos andDahomi. Totheeast
ofLagos theoldcoast-line seems tohavebeen almost
conterminous with thenorthern shores oftheKradu
andLekki lagoons, andthewater-way which connects
thembyway ofEpi,while tothewest itappears to
have trended back northwards beyond thelagoons
ofOluge andPorto Novo. Itisonly after crossing
thenarrow lagoon orcreek called theAjarra Creek,
which runs inaconvex curve from thePortoNovo
lagoon totheOkpara, that stones arefound inthe
soil;andabout twenty miles tothewest ofthisthere
appears tohave been atonetime agreat bay, the
northern limit ofwhich was theKo,orGreat Marsh,
ofDahomi, thirty-five miles from thepresent coast-
line.Thedotted lineintheaccompanying mapshows
theprobable position oftheancient coast-line between
theYolta River andlickki.
Northward oftheoldcoast-line theYoruba country
rises very gradually inasuccession oflow-lying
plateaus, traversed byafew lines oflow hills, or
undulations intheground ;butachain ofmountains,
whose general direction iseastandwest, extends, at
about eight degrees north latitude, fromDahomi to
thenorthern border ofIjesa, where thecountry is
rugged and difiicult. Isolated anddensely-wooded
hills,from 800 to1,200 feethigh, arealsofound in

Abeokuta, isolated masses ofgranite afford evidence
ofgreat denudation. Infactthewhole western coast
ofAfrica, between theIslesdeLos,seventy miles north
ofSierra Leone, andLagos, andprobably beyond
those limits, shows traces ofanenormous denudation.
The table-topped Kofiu Mountain, which rises sheer
from theplain north oftheMelikuri Eiver toaheight
of2,000 feet, isthesoleremnant ofavast capof
sandstone that doubtless atonetime covered the

situated intheKrobo plain ontheGrold Coast, to-
gether with thetable-topped mountains with vertical
cliffs intheAtaklu district, tothenorth oftheQuittah
(Keta) lagoon, willprobably, when geologically exa-
mined, prove tobeother vestiges ofthesame sand-
stone formation.
Oftheearly history oftheYoruba-speaking peoples
nothing isknown, except what canbegleaned from
Dalzel's "History ofDahomey," 1793, fromwhich it
would appear that, atthebeginning oftheeighteenth
century, allthedifferent tribes were united, andwere
ruled byakingwho resided atOldOyo, sometimes
called Katunga. Thekingdom ofYoruba alsoseems
tohave beenmore powerful than theothertwogreat
African kingdoms, Dahomi andAshanti. Between
1724 and1725 theKing ofYoruba espoused the
quarrel oftheKing ofArdra, whose kingdom had
been overthrown byDahomi, andsentalarge army,
chiefly consisting ofcavalry, toinvade Dahomi. By
astratagem*'theYorubas were routed, andtheking

ofDaliomi tlien diplomaticallj sued forpeace, wliicli
wasgranted; butabout September, 1728, anew
quarrel having arisen, tliistime intlieinterests oftlie
King ofWliydali, aYoruba army again invaded
Daliomi, andadesultory war lasted until 1730,when
peace wasoncemore made. In1738 another Yoruba
army invaded Daliomi, defeated theking,andcaptured
andburnt Agbomi, Kana, andZassa ;*andfrom that
timeforward theYorubas annually raided intoDahomi,
ravaging thecountry, andretiring again atthecom-
mencement oftherains. This state ofaffairs was
brought toanendbyatreaty ofpeace made in1747,
bywhich theKing ofDahomi undertook topaya
heavy annual tribute totheKing ofYoruba. After
thiswehear nomore oftheYorubas inDalzel's
History, which isonly carried to1791, except that,
in1786, they interfered toprevent theDahomis from
attacking Porto JSTovo;butthetribute appears tohave
been paiduptothedays ofKing Gezo ofDahomi
(1818).
Governor Dalzel informs us,however, thatwhen
the"Byeos"t (Yorubas) were dissatisfied with a
king, they sent adeputation tohimwith apresent of
parrot's eggs, andamessage that they considered
hemust befatigued with thecares ofgovernment,
andthat itwastime forhim torestandtakealittle
sleep. Upon receiving thismessage, theking forth-
with retired tohisapartments, asiftosleep, and
thengave directions tohiswomen tostrangle him,

tTheYorubas were called Eycos orOyos byoldwriters, after the
name oftlicir capital, Oyo.

vvliicli they accordingly did.* In1774, tliethenking
declined totake tliehint,andreturned theparrot's
eggs. The chiefs tried tosu^Dport thecustom by
force, andOchemi, theprime minister headed arebel-
lion,which was, however, crushed, andOchemi, and
allhisnumerous family were puttodeath.
Thereason ofourhaving suchmeagre information
ofthisgreatWest African kingdom isthattheYorubas
didnotinhabit theterritories onthesea-coast, theEwe
tribes occupying thecoast line asfareast asBadagry,
andtheBenin tribes theportion from Badagry to
Benin. TheEwe tribes had infactspread along
thesea-shore from west toeast, and theBenin
tribes from east towest, tillthey met,andcovered
alltheseafrontage oftheinland territory occupied
bytheYorubas. This neglect onthepart ofthe
Yorubas topushdown totheseamayhavebeen partly
.duetosuperstition, forDalzel says that "thefetiche
oftheEyeos wasthesea,"andthattheyandtheir
kingwere threatened with death bytheir priests if
theyever dared tolookupon it.Slave traders and
others, whofrequented theSlave Coast during the
lastcentury, were thus notbrought intocontact with
theYorubas, andconsequently wehear but little of
them ;while theliterature concerning AsLanti and
Dahomi, which, hkeYoruba, were originally inland
powers, butwhose invasions ofthecoast kingdoms
brought them intocontact withEuropeans, isample.
Asfarascanbeascertained, thechief strength of
Yoruba layinitscavalry, which wassaid tonumber

itisyetaltogether extinct.

100,000, amanifest exaggeration, forhorses have
never beennumerous inthefew districts ofWest
Africa inwhich itispossible forthem tolive. The
report astothenumber ofcavalry reached thetraders
through thecoast tribe,whoowned nohorses, and
whowere nodoubt greatly impressed bythespec-
tacle ofafewscore ofmounted men. According to
tradition, thefollowing wasthemethod ofdetermin-
ingthenumber ofmenrequired foramilitary expedi-
tion.Anox-hide waspegged down infront ofthe
general's tent,andthehorsemen made torideover it
insuccession between two spears. When, bythis
process, aholehadbeenworn inthe hide, the
number ofmenwasthought sufficient foranordinary
campaign. Forserious operations twoox-hides were
used, oneplaced overtheother.
Although asweknow from Dalzel's History, Oyo,
orYoruba, wasapowerful kingdom atleast asearly
as1724, Yoruba traditional history carries usback
nofurther than theendoftheeighteenth century, a
factwhich shows what little reliance canbeplaced
upon thetraditions ofnations who areunacquainted
withtheartofwriting. The firstking ofwhom the
aroJdn, orchroniclers, haveanyknowledge isAjagbo,
whoappears tohave reigned soon after 1780, and
whose name ispreserved inthemetrical sentence
which fixes therhythm ofthe ogidigho drum, as
follows :Gbo,Ajagho, gboohagho, Idemi, Idosigbo.*
*"Grow old,AjagbOj grow oldking, grow old,may Ialsogrow

Intliedays ofAjagbo tliekingdom ofYoruba con-
sisted oftliefourfollowing states.
(1)Yoruba proper, wliose capital, OldOjo, or
Katunga, wassituated some ninety miles tothenortli
oftliepresent town ofOyo. Theking ofthis state,
whose titlewasAlafin, orAlaioofin, literally "Onewho
owns theentering ofthepalace," wastheruler over
alltheYoruba-speaking tribes.
(2)Egba, which laytothesouth andwest ofthe
above kingdom. ItschieftownwasAke,andfrom it
thechief took his title ofAlahe, "Onewhoowns
Ake."
(3)Ketu. Thiswas then, asnow, thewestern
province. Itscapital wasKetu, andfrom itthechief
took histitle ofAlakeiu, "Onewhoowns Ketu."
(4)Jebu, which laysouth and east ofYoruba
proper. Itwasdivided intoJebuEemu andJebu
Ode, each having itsown chief, buttheruler ofthe
latter, called theAwujale, wasconsidered thechief of
thewhole.
Therulers ofYoruba, Egba, andKetu styled each
other "brother."
Ajagbo wassucceeded byAbiodun, who issaid to
have enjoyed alongandpeaceful reign, sothatthe
reign ofhisbrother and successor, Arogangan, can
scarcely havecommenced before 1800. Itwasduring
thereign ofArogangan that theYoruba kingdom
commenced tobreak up.TheFulas, itseems, over-
rantheterritory oftheHans as,andthelatter, driven
southward, sought refuge inthenorthern provinces of
Yoruba. Arogangan had appointed hisnephew,
Afunja, governor ofIlorin, thenorth-eastern pro-


INTRODUCTOliY. 11
vince, wliicli contained alarge nnmber ofHausa
refugees, andAfunja, being ambitious, conceived the
project ofutilising tlieHausas inorder todethrone
hisuncle andmake himself Alafin. Hisplans being
matured, heraised aninsurrection, -which metwith a
measure ofsuccess, forOyowas besieged, and
Arogangan, inorder toavoid falling intothehands
ofhisnephew, poisoned himself ;butAfunja was
notable tosecure thethrone, astheelders ofOjo
elected tothemonarchy Adebo, thebrother of
Arogangan, andAfunja had toretire toIlorin,
where hemaintained asemi-independent position.
These events aresupposed tohave taken place about
1807, and itwasabout thesame time thatsome of
theYorubas firstpushed tothesonth andcolonised
Lagos. The first chief ofLagos wasnamed Ashipa,
and issaid tohave belonged tothefamily ofthe
Alafin.
Adebo only reigued about fourmonths, anddied
suddenly, from which itwassupposed thathewas
poisoned. Hewas succeeded byMaku, who en-
deavoured tomake head against theMohammedan
tribeswhowerenowpressing infrom thenorth, but
hewas defeated inagreat battle, andcommitted
suicide, aftsr areign ofabout onlythree months. An
interregnum nowensued, during which thereins of
power were heldbytheOba-slwrun, orprime minister,
and itwasnotuntil fiveyears hadelapsed thatanew
king,named Majotu, was elected. Hereigned about
seven oreight years, committed suicide onaccount,
tradition says, ofthemisbehaviour ofhisson,andwas
succeeded byAmodo.


12 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Afunja had, since 1807, remained inpossession of
llorin, where hehadsought tostrengthen himself by
encouraging Mohammedans tosettle, and,about 1825,
whileAmodo wasengaged with theinvading tribes
from thenorth, heagainmadewarupon Yoruba. He
captured anddestroyed anumber oftowns, andwas
apparently about tocarry allbefore him,when, for
some reason that hasnever transpired, hewascon-
veyed back tothetown ofllorin bythose veryHausa
mercenaries through whose aidhehadhoped tobe-
come Alafin, andpubhcly burned alive. TheMoham-
medan party had forsome years been dominant in
llorin, andnow, declaring that itwould nolonger
recognise apagan king, itelected aMohammedan to
thesupreme power, andsevered theconnection with
Yoruba.
llorin nowtook thelead intheMohammedan in-
vasion ofYoruba, andtheYorubas seem tohavebeen
invariably worsted. In1830,when itwasvisited by
Lander, OldOyowas stillthecapital ofYoruba, but
between 1833and1835 itwascaptured anddestroyed
bytheMohammedans, andtheYorubas, flying south-
wards, founded their present capital Oyo, about
ninety miles south oftheoldone.TheEgbas, taking
advantage oftheoverthrow ofYoruba, declared them-
selves independent, buttheYorubas, assoon asthey
were settled intheirnew territory, attacked them
with vigour, anddrove them outofalltheir northern
towns.Adesultory warthenlingered tillabout 1838,
when theEgbas abandoned their territory, andmoving
tothesouth, founded their present capital, Abeokuta.
Thenewtown was divided into several distinct


INTRODUCTORY. 13
quarters, ortownships, which werenamed after an
equalnumber oftowns thathadbeen destroyed inthe
war,andoneofthem, Ake, stillpreserves thename
oftheoldEg-ba capital. Although these events oc-
curred sorecently, theyhave already become clothed
withmyth ;andLishabe, thechiefwho ledthem to
Abeokuta, isbelieved bytheEgbas tohave been a
o-iantandademi-god.
About thesame time, Ibadan, atown oftheold
province ofEgba, situated some thirty-five miles
south ofOyo, declared itself independent ofEgba;
theoriginal Egba inhabitants having been driven out
bytheJebus, andthelatter, intheir turn,byYoruba
refugees. Other secessions took place, andby1840
theYoruba kingdom had splitupintothefollowing
independent states.
(1)Yoruba, south ofOldYoruba, capital Oyo.
(2)Egba, south andwest ofOldEgba, capital
Abeokuta.
(3)Ketu.
(4)Jebu.
(5)Ibadan, asmall state south ofOyo. Itowned
anominal allegiance tothe Alafin, because its
inhabitants were Yoruba refugees, butwas really
independent.
(6)Ijesa, asmall state south ofIlorin. Theruler
wasstyled theOwa.
(7) Ife,asmall state south-west ofIjesa. The
rulerwasstyled theOni.
Theformer Yoruba province ofIlorin wasnow
inhabited byFulas, Bornus, andHausas, andwassaid
tohave apopulation of300,000, 80,000 ofwhom

were inthetown ofIlorin. The Fulas were the
dominant race, and thegovernment was intlieir
liands.
Shortly after 1840 theEkiti tribes, asthejwere
afterwards termed, that is,theinhabitants ofthe
various towns lying between Ibadan andIjesa, and
theadjoining territory tothesouth, formed acon-
federation, which wassoon joined byIfeand Ijesa,
theruler ofthelatter state being elected head ofthe
confederation. TheMohammedans ofIlorin were
the first totakealarm atthis coalition, andattacked
theconfederates, destroying orannexing several
towns while Ibadan soon followed suit,and after a
time succeeded inconquering andannexing Ijesa.
The result ofthese various conflicts was thatthe
confederation was entirely subdued, onehalfpassing
under therule ofIlorin andtheother under that of
Ibadan. Before long, however, theinhabitants of
thetowns which hadbeen annexed toIlorin applied
toIbadan forassistance, andanother warensued,
which resulted intheexpulsion ofthe Ilorins, and
theestablishment oftheruleofIbadan over thewhole
Ekiti confederation. Thiswasabout 1858.
While these events weretaking place intheinterior,
Lagos, which, aswehave seen, wascolonised from
Yoruba atthebeginning ofthecentury, hadbecome
aplace ofsome note asaslave emporium. Thewars
inthenorth, which hadbeen almost incessant since
therebellion ofAfunja about 1807, hadresulted in
thecapture ofmany thousands ofprisoners ofwar,
ofboth sexes and allages, andthedregs ofthese,
themenwho Avere ofnolocal importance, andthe

women whowere nolonger attractive, were, in
accordance with,theusaal practice, sold totlieslave-
traders. Lagos wasthemost convenient port, and
•fheywere therefore marched down there ingangs to
await shipment. This traffic inslaves, which brought
Lagos intosome notoriety, commenced about the
year 1815, andsoon attained very large dimensions.
In1836 astruggle forthesuccession broke outin
Lagos, and resulted inKosoko, thelegitimate pre-
tender, being expelled thekingdom byhisrival
Oluwole, whosecured thethrone forhimself. Olu-
wole died in1841, andwassucceeded byAkitoye,
whowas foolish enough toinvite Kosoko, whowas
still alive and inbanishment, tocomeandlive in
Lagos. Kosoko readily accepted theinvitation, soon
began conspiring, andbefore longfound himself suf-
ficiently wellsupported torebel. Inthestruggle
which ensued thetown ofLagos wasburned, and
Akitoye driven intobanishment. Hefound arefuge
atBadagry, and, inorder toinduce theEnglish to
espouse hiscause, promised that, ifhewere re-instated
atLagos, hewould help tosuppress theslave-trade.
This negotiation coming totheknowledge ofKosoko,
hedespatched aforce toBadagry toattack Akitoye,
which burned thetown, killed anEnglish trader
named Glee,anddestroyed agreat deal ofproperty
belonging toBritish subjects. The senior naval
officer upon thestation thereupon determined tosup-
port Akitoye against Kosoko, andH.M. sloops

the sliips' boats, towed bytheBloodhound, entered
thelagoon andproceeded towards Lagos Island. As
theBritish Consul, whowaswith the flotilla, had
hopes thatKosoko would submit toadisplay of
force, flags oftruce werekept flying ;andalthough,
onrounding the first point, aheavy musketry fire
wasopened bythenatives, the firewasnotreturned,
andthe flagswere notlowered tilltheboats were
within amile ofthetown. Atthispoint several
guns opened ontheboats, sotheflags oftruce were
hauled down andthe firereturned. The firefrom
theboats had,however, but little effect onthenatives,
whowere well covered bystockades andmud walls,
and aparty ofonehundred and sixtymenwas
accordingly landed. They found themselves ina
maze ofnarrow streets, from every corner ofwhich
theywere fireduponbyconcealed enemies, and after
losing two officers killed andseveral menwounded,
theywere compelled toretreat totheboats.
This failure ledtoamore determined attack in
December, onthe26th ofwhich month aconsider-
able force, under thecommand ofCommodore H.
"W.Bruce, entered thelagoon inboats. Thenatives
offered astubborn resistance, andhad inposition
several guns, which were exceedingly well served.

upavigorous bombardment, wliicli wasmaintained
allthat day,andcontinued nextmorning from day-
break until about 11a.m.,when amagazine onshore
blew upand set j&re tothetown. The flames,
fanned bythesea-breeze, spread with remarkable
rapidity, andtheheatwas sointense that the fire
ofthenatives gradually slackened andthen finally
stopped. Next morning, Kosoko and hisfollowers
having abandoned the place, the British landed.
They found thebeach strongly stockaded, andan
enfilading piece ofordnance atevery promontory.
Pifty-two guns were captured, butthevictory was
dearly purchased, asthetotal lossduring thetwo
days' operations amounted totwo officers and fifteen
men killed, four officers andsixty-eight menwounded,
many ofthem very severely.
Akitoye wasnow reinstated, andonJanuary 1st,
1852, signed atreaty, undertaking tosuppress the
export slave trade, and toexpel allEuropeans en-
gaged inthe traffic. About September ofthesame
yearsome Portuguese slave traders, whohadbeen
expelled under this treaty, returned toLagos, and,
with theassistance ofsome ofthe chiefs, secretly
renewed the traffic. Akitoye, being informed ofwhat
wasgoing on,strove tostop it,whereupon thePortu-
guese incited thechiefs torebel, and inAugust, 1853,
Kosoko returned from Epi,where hehadtaken
refuge, tohead themovement. The British naval
authorities again interfered infavour ofAkitoye; a
party ofseamen andmarines waslanded tosupport
him, andonthe13th ofAugust, after asharp
