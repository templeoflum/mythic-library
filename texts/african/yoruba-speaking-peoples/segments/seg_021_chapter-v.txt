CHAPTER V.
PEIESTS ANDWOESHIP.
TheYomba priesthood isdivided into recognised
orders, butbefore describing tliem itwillbeneces-
sary togivesome account ofasecret society which is
inseparably connected with thepriesthood, andwhich,
except inJebu, where itiscalled Oshogbo, isknown
astheOgboni Society.
TheOgboni Society really holds thereins ofgovern-
ment, andkings themselves areobliged tosubmit to
itsdecrees. Themembers arepopularly believed to
possess asecret fromwhich they derive their power,
buttheir only secret appears tobethat ofapowerful
andunscrupulous organisation, eachmember ofwhich
isbound toassist every other, while allarebound to
carry out,and ifnecessary enforce, thedecrees ofthe
body. Eachtownandvillage has itsOgboni "lodge,"
andthemembers recognise eachotherbyconventional
signs andpasswords. Attheir meetings, which are
heldwith agreat affectation ofmystery, they delibe-
rateupon allmatters which interest thetribe orcom-
munity. The decisions oftheOgboni are final, and
nothing ofimportance canbedone without their
consent When themissionaries wished toestablish
themselves atAbeokuta, theking could notgrant the

necessary permission till tlieOgbonis hadconsidered
tliematter andsignified their consent. Thepower of
theOgbonis, however, varies indifferent states, and
inIbadan theyseem tobelittle more than public
executioners.
Ofcourse, since theorganisation issecret, little can
really beknown about it.Death issaid tobethe
penalty forbetraying thesecrets oftheorder. Ac-
cording tonative report, amember who hasbeen
convicted ofsuchanoffence isplaced inanarrow cell,
with hislegsprotruding through twoholes inthe
wall intoanadjoining cell,where they arefastened to
twostakes driven intotheearthen floor. Theexecu-
tioner sitsinthisadjoining cell,andtheoffender is
tortured todeath byhaving thefleshscraped from his
legswith sharp-edged shells. Whether this istrue
ornot itisimpossible tosay.
According tosome natives theOgboni Society has
for itschief object thepreservation ofestablished
religious customs, while according toothers itis
principally occupied with the civilpower. Itreally
appears toconcern itself with every matter ofpublic
interest, andseems toresemble inallimportant par-
ticulars avery similar society, called Porro, which is
foundamong theTimnis ofSierra Leone. What is
quite certain isthat theprotecting deity ofthe
Ogboni isthegoddess Odudua, who isgenerally
spoken ofbymembers byher titleHe(Earth).
Itseems probable that the society was originally
intended forthe initiation tomanhood ofyouths
whohad arrived atpuberty, liketheBoguera of
theBechuanas, theNiamwali oftheManganja, and

theceremony oftheMpongwe, described byMr.
Winwood Reade,* and that itscivil and judicial
functions arelater usuriDations. Ifthiswere so, it
would tosome extent beconnected with phallic
worship, and phallic emblems areverycommonly
seen carved onthedoors ofOgboni lodges. The
name Ogboni isprobably derived from Ogba, "Com-
panion."
TheAlafin ofYoruba isthechief ofalltheOgboni,
andhethus isable toexert influence beyond the
limits ofhisownkingdom. Inmost states thechief
oftheOgboni isthehead ofthepriesthood, and is
styled Ekeji OrisJm, "JsText totheGods." Hecon-
vokes councils ofpriests onextraordinary occasions,
anddecides disputed points. InJebu everyman of
rank isanOshogbo, butinIbadan, ashasbeen said,
theOgboni seem chiefly toexercise thefunctions of
executioners. Criminals aredelivered tothem for
execution and areput todeath secretly inthe
Ogboni lodge. Theheads areafterwards fixed toa
tree inthemarket-place, butthebodies arenever
seen again, andtherelatives arethus unable togive
them the rites ofsepulture, which isconsidered a
great disgrace.
TheYoruba priesthood (Olorisha, priest) isdivided
intothree orders, each ofwhich isfurther subdivided
intoranks orclasses.
The firstorder comprises three ranks, viz. (1)the
Babalawo, orpriests ofIfa;(2)priests who practise
medicine, andwhoserve Osanhin andAroni, gods of
medicine;(3)priests ofObatala andOdudua. White

TheMagba, orchief priest ofSliango, hastwelve
assistants, who aretermed, inorder ofauthority,
right-hand {Oton), left-hand {Osin), third, fourth,
fifth,and soon.They reside near Kuso, thespot
atwhich Shango issaid tohave descended intothe
earth.
Thepriests, besides acting asintermediaries between
thegodsandmen, preside atalltrials bjordeal, and
prepare and sellcharms, amulets, &c.The priests
ofIfaarediviners proper, butother priests also
practise divination, though notwith palm-nuts and
theboard peculiar toIfa.Themethods arevarious;
one,called hehe, isacasting oflotsbymeans ofsmall
sticks orstalks ofgrass, each ofwhich represents
aparticular individual; another, called gogo, isa
drawing oflots.Acertain number ofgrass stalks,
oneofwhich isbent, areheld inthehand orwrapped
inapiece ofcloth, sothat theends onlyshow; and
each person inturn draws one, thebent stalk in-
dicating theonewho isinfault. Theperson of
apriest issacred, and violence offered toone is
severely punished.
The office ofpriest ishereditary inthefamilies of
priests, butmembers arerecruited inother modes.
Seminaries foryouths and girls, likethose ofthe
losio oftheEVve tribes, arearegular institution, andmthem applicants forthepriestly office undergo a
novitiate oftwoorthree years, attheendofwhich
they areconsecrated andtake anewname. The
ceremony ofconsecration isvery similar tothat
described inthelastvolume.*

Theordinary service ofthetemples isperformed
bythedependents ofthepriesthood, theaffihated
youths, andthe"wives"ofthegods,whokeep the
vessels filled with water, andevery fifthdaysweep
outthetemples. Inthevicinity the affiliated young
people practise thereligious dances and songs, and
forhours together maybeheard repeatmg chants
ofonlytwoorthree notes, tilltheywork themselves
upinto astate offrenzy, andbreak outintoloud
shrieks and cries. ,
Temples areordinarily circular huts built ofclay,
with conical roofs thatched with grass;theinterior
isusually painted with thecolour sacred tothegod,and
thedoorsandshutters, andthepostswhich support the
overhanging eaves, arecarved. Thetemples ofthe
chief gods areusually situated ingroves offinetrees,
amongst which oneortwo large silk-cotton trees
(Bomhaces), which seem toberegarded withveneration
throughout allWest Africa, tower above the rest.
From thesummits ofthetrees, orfrom tallbamboos,
lono'streamers flutter inthewind and testify tothe
sanctity ofthelocality. Sometimes there isagrove
only, without anytemple, butmore frequently the
grove oravenue adjoins ashrine. These groves are
recrarded with superstitious reverence, and have
proper names; agrove sacred toIfaand hiscom-
panion Odu is,forinstance, called anIgbodu. Near
thewestern entrance ofthetown ofOdeOndo isa,
celebrated grove orsacred avenue, toone side ot
which, intheadjoining bush, the sacrifice ofhuman
victims andtheexecution ofcriminals takes place.|

arenotallowed topass eacli otlier intliisavenue, one
ofthem being required toturnbackandwait tilltlie

Thetemples oftutelary deities oftowns areusually
tobefound inthecentral square ofthetown, ornear
theprincipal gate, andthose ofthetutelary deities
offamilies orhouseholds near thehouse-door orin
theyard. Inshape andconstruction they resemble
thetemples ofthechief gods, butthose ofthepro-
tecting deities ofhouseholds aremere miniatures, and
aresometimes onlysmall sheds, open attheendsand
sides. Besides these structures, which areseen in
every street, oneoften finds larger huts, circular in
shape, thatched with grass, andlarge enough tocon-
tainaseated man. These, which might bemistaken
fortemples but forthefact thatthey contain no
images, arebuilt fortheaccommodation ofpious per-
sonswhowish tomeditate andpray.Atemple is
called HeOrisha, "House oftheOrisha."
TheYoruba gods arealmost invariably represented
byimages inhuman form, which appear grotesque,
butarenotmeant tobeso,thegrotesqueness being
merely theresult ofwant ofskill. These images are
regarded asemblems ofabsent gods. They" them-
selves arenotworshipped, andthere isnoidolatry in
theproper sense oftheword, though nodoubfc there
isatendency toconfuse thesymbol with thegod.
Likewise, through aconfusion ofobjective and
subjective connection, there isanidea that the
godenters into theimago toreceive the sacrifices
offered byhisfaithful followers, a,ndtolisten totheir
adoration andprayers. Earthen vessels receive the

libations ofblood and palm-pil, while ihe j^olks of
eggs, wliicli liere, aselsewhere inWest Africa, are
regarded asofferings pecuharly proper tothegods,
aresmeared upon theposts, door-sills, andthreshold.*
Inimportant temples, andalsointhehouses ofkings
andchiefs ofhigh rank, atalldrum, called agbeclu, is
kept. Itisusually covered with carvings represent-
inganimals and birds, andthephallus. Thisdrum
isonlybeaten atreligious fetesandpublic ceremonies,
andaportion oftheblood ofthevictims immolated is
always sprinkled upon thesymbolic carvings, upon
which palm-wine, theyolks ofeggs,andthefeathers of
sacrificed chickens arealsosmeared. Inthiscasethe
offering istotheprotecting spirit ofthedrum, which
isthat ofaslavewhohasbeen sacrificed onit.This
plan ofsupplying anartificial guardian-spirit for
objects, other than natural objects, which arecon-
sidered ofimportance, isadevelopment ofghost-
worship, andontheGrold Coast such guardians are
provided forthe"stools"ofkings andchiefs, aswell
asfortemple andstate drums.
Sacrifice isthemost important part ofceremonial
worship, andnogodcanbeconsulted without it,the
value oftheoffering varying with theimportance of
theoccasion. Besides the offerings thusmade for
special purposes, oronspecial occasions, persons who
arethefollowers ofagod— that is,those whowear
hisdistinguishing badge andarebelieved tobeunder
hisprotection— make, asarule, daily offerings ofsmall

Asliasalready been mentioned, eacligod liascer-
tainanimals which itisproper tosacrifice tohim;
tousethephraseology oftheOldTestament, every
godhas his"clean" and his"unclean "animals.
Some sacrifices are"unclean "toallthegods, asthe
turkey-buzzard (gunu-gitnu), thevulture (aJcala), and
thegrey parrot (ofe). Asthetwoformer devour
offalandcarrion, and are,infact, scavengers, wecan
seeareason forconsidering them unclean ;butwhy
thegrey parrot should alsobesoconsidered isnot
evident. The natives endeavour toaccount forthe
"uncleanliness "ofthese birds bytwopopular say-
ings,which runasfollows:—
"Theturkey-buzzard wasrequired tooffer sacrifice,
butherefused todoso ;thevulture wasrequired to
offer sacrifice, buthealsorefused. When thepigeon
wasrequired tooffer sacrifice, hedidso."
"Thegrey parrot being required tooffer sacrifice,
refused tooffer it;butthegreen parrot took the
sacrifice and offered it.After all,thegrey parrot is
acitizen ofOyo (the capital ofYoruba) andthegreen
parrot aninhabitant ofthecountry, andyetpeople
thought thatthegrey parrot wasnotwise."
Astheturkey-buzzard, vulture, andgrey parrot
refused tooffer sacrifice, theybecame "unclean,"
while thepigeon andthegreen j)arrot, which offered
it,remained "clean." The latter part ofthesecond
saying appears tobeironical, forthegrey parrot, in
consequence ofitsuncleanliness, isnever offered up,
while thegreen parrot issacrificed.


102 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES,
Onimportant occasions thepriest designates totlie
suppliants tlie sacrifice which hethinks necessary
toinduce thegod tolend afavourable ear.They
prostrate themselves before theshrine with cries of
"Toto, toto-hun,'' anexclamation which denotes humi-
liation and submission, while the priest, inalong
harangue, presents their petition, orcase, tothegod.
Heusually begins hisaddress byflattering thegod,
dwelling upon hisfameandpower, andshowing how
hishumble servitors areentirely dependent upon his
good- will. Then hecalls attention totheself-abase-
ment ofthegod's faithful followers "So-and-so," to
thevalue ofthevictim which theyhavebrought him,
andbegshim tobepropitious and listen totheir
humble prayer. Hethen sacrifices thevictim, sprinkles
some oftheblood ontheimage, pours theremainder
ontheground,* andplaces theheadandentrails ina
shallow earthen vessel infront ofthetemple.
Sacrifices arethus offered inthepresence ofthe
god,that is,before hisimage, which heissupposed
toanimate forthetime being, butthere isoneex-
ception tothisgeneral rule. This is,onoccasions
when sacrifice ismade atcross-roads, oratapoint
where several roads meet, inorder toavert anim-
pending calamity. Inthis case the sacrifice ispro-
bablymade tothelegion ofspirits, mostly evil,who
aresupposed tohaunt the forests anduninhabited
tracts ofcountry ;andthegeneral belief isthat the
approaching danger isdiverted from theproper
road, andturned away from thecommunity which it

meaning"tobeacceptable asasacrifice."

threatened. Inreference tothispractice aproverb
says,"The cross-roads donotdread sacrifices."*
Sometimes, inresponse totheajDpeal ofthepriest,
thegodanswers inabird-like, twittering voice, first
heard whispering atalittle distance andthencoming
nearer. When thisoccurs, theworshippers lie]3rone
with their faces totheground, awe-stricken, while
thepriest carries onaconversation with the spirit-
voice, andsubsequently interprets ittotheauditors.
This conception thataspirit-voice should beatwitter-
ing,chirping, orwhistling sound isverywide-spread;
asDr.Tylor hasshown, itused toexistamong the
Greeks andRomans, and itmay atthepresent day
befoundamong theIndian tribes ofNorth America,
theZulus, andthePolynesians.! The spirit-voice is
nodoubt produced byaconfederate priest, bymeans
ofablade ofgrass, oraleaf, placed between the
teeth.
Theimage ofagodwhich ismerely tutelar toone
individual isonlytreated with respect during the life
ofthat individual, after which itisthrown away.
Since thegod ispersonal totheindividual, andhasno
other purpose than toprotect him, theimage isonly
ofuseasavehicle ofcommunication between them so
long astheman lives. After hisdeath thegodno
longer enters oranimates theimage, which, inconse-
quence loses itssacred character, andbecomes an
ordinary object ofnovalue. Thus, whenever aman
dies, histutelary god, ifhehad one, isthrown away

Toytliesuryiving members oftliehouseliold, andthe
extraordinary belief, heldbysome Europeans, that
thenegro makes andbreaks hisgods atwill,may
probably beaccounted forasamisconception ofthis
practice.
Although human sacrifices occur amongst the
Yoruba tribes, wefindamong themnoparallel tothe
wholesale slaughters which take place, orrather used
totake place, inAshanti andDahomi. Thereason
nodoubt is,thattheYoruba kings and chiefs arenot
sufficiently powerful tobeable tosacrifice lifeona
large scale; forthemore powerful themonarch, the
more hecanafford todisregard public opinion, and
since themasses supply thevictims, human sacrifices
arenever regarded bythem with favour. Whether,
whenYoruba wasahomogeneous andpowerful state^
human sacrifices were astate institution, astheywere
inDahomi, wehavenomeans ofascertaining, but all
theprobabilities point inthat direction.
During theperiod that theYorubas have been
known toEuropeans nolarge number ofvictims has
beenputtodeath even ontheoccasion ofthedeath
ofaking.Aking ofOyodiedonApril 27th, 1859,
andonly fourmenwere sacrificed, butforty-two of
hiswives poisoned themselves inorder toaccompany
him totheLand oftheDead. InOndo about twenty
persons were sacrificed when aking died,andthere
wasanestablished procedure, onevictim having tobe
immolated when thecorpse waswashed, four atdif-
ferent entrances tothe palace, andasixth inthe
market-place. Onthedayoftheburial from eight to
tenvictims, with acat,were either killed andinterred


PRIESTS ANDWORSHIP. 105
with thecorpse orburied alive, andduring thethree
months which arerequired toelapse before anew
kingcanbeinstalled there were occasional sacrifices.
In1882 theking ofOndo entered intoanengage-
ment with thegovernment ofLagos toputanendto
human sacrifices, buthedoesnotappear tohavekept
it.Atthepresent day,amongst allthe tribes, when
aking orchief dies itisusual fortwoofhiswives to
commit suicide, andshould novolunteers beforth-
coming, twoareselected andput todeath. Horses
areoften killed andburied with their owners.
There wasuntil very recently, andperhaps still is,
anannual human sacrifice atAbeokuta, called the
"basket-sacrifice," aeuphemism designed toconceal
therealnature oftheceremony. Thevictim was
enclosed inalong basket, asinDahomi, fromwhence
perhaps thecustom wasadopted, thrown down from
aheight, anddespatched byamobarmed with clubs.
Itwasanational offering, butwhen times were pros-
perous thevictim wasoften spared anddedicated toa
god,whose temple-slave hethenbecame. There used
alsotobeanannual sacrifice ofonehuman victim at
Ikoradu, andasimilar offering every sixth year tothe
godOgun atIkriku.
Intimes ofgreat urgency human sacrifices are
offered tosome ofthegods, forexample, toShango,
Ifa,Elegba, Ogun, Olokun, andOlosa ;butthey are
nearly always made atnight, and thepeople are
required toremain intheir houses. There isnone of

bloodslied must produce. Even tliepriests, always
tlie last tobeinfluenced byachange ofpublic
opinion, seem toregard buman sacrifice assometbmg
tobedeplored, butoccasionally necessary. The vic-
tim isslaughtered almost insecret, and tliesound of
thetemple-drums andthemournful chants ofthe
assistants alone inform thepeople ofwhat istaking
place. Thenatives avoid anydirect reference tothe
subject."Thenight isbad," they say.Asonthe
Gold Coast, thevictim isalways decapitated infront
oftheimage, sothat theblood from thesevered
arteries mayspurt over it.ForBlegba thebody is
opened andtheentrails placed before himinashallow
dish. Thebody ofaman sacrificed tothesea-god
Olokun isthrown into the sea,andthat ofaman
offered toOlosa intothelagoon.
TheCommissioners whowere sent totheinterior
in1886 tobreak upthecamps ofthebelligerent
tribes, succeeded ininducing therulers ofIjesa
and Ekiti tosignanenactment abolishing human
sacrifices, both tothegods and atthefuneral obse-
quies ofmen ofrank. They endeavoured toobtain
asimilar undertaking from the Ifes,buthere they
metwithsome difficulty. Ifebeing thehome ofhuman

face, with along pointed noseandthin lips, but

mean the spirits ofcliildren wlio diebefore reaching
puberty, and also aclass ofevil spirits who cause
children todie ;achildwho diesbefore twelve years
ofagebeing called anAbiku, andthespirit, orspirits,
whocaused thedeath being alsocalled Abiku.
Thegeneral ideaseems tobethattheuninhabited
tracts ofcountry abound withnumbers ofevil spirits
ordemons, who suffer from hunger, thirst, andcold,
since nobody offers sacrifice tothem andtheyhave
notemples, andwho areconstantly endeavourmg to
improve their condition byentering thebodies of
new-born babes. Only oneAbiku canenter and
dwell inthebody ofthesame child, and, asthere is
great competition amongst theAbikus forsuch a
position, anAbiku isonly suffered byhiscompanions
toenter peaceably, and, infact, toberecogmsed as
having vested rights inachild, oncondition ofhis
promising them ashare ofthecomforts heisabout to
obtain.
When anAbiku hasentered achild hetakes forhis
own use,and fortheuse ofhiscompanions, the
greater part ofthefood that thechild eats,who in
consequence begins topineaway andbecome ema-
ciated. IfanAbiku whohadentered achildwere
notbound tosupply thewants ofother Abikus who
hadnotsucceeded inobtaining human tenements, no
greatharm would ensue, since thesustenance taken
could bemade sufficient both forthechild and his
tenant. Itistheincessant demands that aremade

dwelling Abiku hastosatisfy, that destroy the child,

ments. When acliild ispeevish and fretful itis
believed that tlieoutside Abikus arehurting him in
order tomake theindwelling Abiku givethem more
toeat;foreverything done tothechild isfeltbyhis
Abiku. The indwelling Abiku isthus, toagreat
extent, identified with thechild himself, and itispos-
sible that thewhole superstition maybeacorruption
oftheGrold Coast belief inthesisa*
Amother who seesher child gradually wasting
away without apparent cause, concludes thatanAbiku
hasentered it,or,asthenatives frequently express
it,that shehasgiven birth toanAbiku, andthat
itisbeing starved because theAbiku isstealing
allitsnourishment. Togetridoftheindwelling
Abiku, and itscompanions outside, theanxious mother
offers asacrifice offood ;andwhile theAbikus are
supposed tobedevouring the spiritual part ofthe
food,andtohave their attention diverted, sheattaches
ironringsandsmall bells totheankles ofthechild,
andhangs iron chains round hisneck. Thejingling
oftheironandthetinkling ofthebells issupposed
tokeep theAbikus atadistance, hence thenumber of
children that aretobeseenwith their feetweighed
down with ironornaments.
Sometimes thechild recovers itshealth, and itis
then believed that thisprocedure hasbeen effective,
andthat theAbikus have been driven away. If,
however, noimprovement takes place, orthechild
grows worse, themother endeavours todrive outthe
Abiku bymaking small incisions inthebody ofthe
child, andputting therein green peppers orspices,

believing that shewillthereby cause pain tothe
Abikn andmakehimdepart. Thepoor child screams
with pain, bntthemother hardens herheart inthe
belief thattheAbiku issuffering equally.
Should thechild die itis,ifburied atall,buried
without anyfuneral ceremony, beyond theprecincts
ofthetown orvillage, inthebush; most other
interments beingmade inthefloors ofthedwelling-
houses. Often thecorpse issimply thrown intothe
bush, topunish theAbiku, saythenatives. Sometimes a
mother, todeter theAbiku which hasdestroyed her
child from entering thebody ofanyother infant she
maybear inthefuture, willbeat, pound, andmutilate
the little corpse, while threatening andinvoking
every evilupon theAbiku which hascaused the
calamity. Theindwelling Abiku isbelieved tofeel
theblows andwounds inflicted onthebody, andto
hearandbeterrified bythethreats andcurses.
Teee-Spirits.
Several varieties oftrees arebelieved tobe
inhabited byindwelling spirits, which arenotexactly
gods, butanswer more tothehama-dryads ofAncient
Greece, ortotheelves ofmedieval Europe. From
theanalogy oftheTshi tribes there islittle doubt
butthat these tree-spirits were once gods ofthe
Srahmantin type, i.e.,ofthetype ofthose which on
theGold Coast arebelieved toanimate thegigantic
silk-cotton trees; butnow, owing tothe great
increase inthenumber ofgeneral objects ofworship,

matter oflessimportance, tliej liave been shorn of
agreat deal oftheirpower, andpushed more intothe
background.
TheAshorin tree isonewhich isinhabited bya
spirit who, itisbelieyed, would, ifitsattention were
notdiverted, drive away anyone whoattempted to
fellthetree. Thewoodman therefore places alittle
palm-oil ontheground asalure,andwhen thespirit
leaves thetree tolickupthedelicacy, proceeds tocutdown itslateabode.
TheApa, frequently called theAfrican mahogany,
ISmhabited byanevil spirit, and iscommonly seen
encircled with palm-leaves, andwithanearthen pot
atItsfoot toreceive theofferings ofwoodcutters.
ItISbeheved toemitaphosphorescent lightbynight.Thewood ofthistree isinsomedemand forthecon-
struction ofdrums, which arehollow wooden cylinders
covered withhide atoneend ;butbefore itcanbecutdown the spirit must bepropitiated byanoffering,
usually consisting ofafowlandsome palm-oil. TheApa istheemblem ofvengeance.
The IroJco (silk-cotton tree) isalsoinhabited bya
spirit, but itisnotvery powerful ormalicious, andwhen aman desires tofellsuch atree itissufficient
protection forhim toinvoke theindwelling spirit of
hisownhead byrubbing alittle palm-oil onhis
forehead. The IroJco isused chiefly forbuilding,
whence probably itcomes tobetheemblem ofrefuge.'Aproverb, referring totherisks aman runs in
cutting down trees inhabited byspirits, says "The
axethatcutsthetree isnotafraid, butthewoodman
covers hisheadwith etu"(amagic powder).

These customs maybecompared with those ofthe
modem Greeks ofSiphinos, one oftheCyclades.
Mr.Bent says*thatwhen thewoodcutters have to
cutdown atreethey suppose tobeinhabited bya
spirit (hamadryad), they areexceedingly careful when
itfalls toprostrate themselves humbly andmsilence,
lestthe spirit should chastise them asitescapes.
Cato alsotinstructs awoodcutter that, inorder to
escape theconsequences ofthinning asacred grove,
hemust sacrifice ahog,andbegpermission tothm

As isthecaseamong theEwe tribes oftheSlave
Coast, wizards and witches arebytheYorubas
believed tohold nocturnal meetings atthefoot of
trees tenanted byspirits, more especially the^pa,
whose indwelling spirit isbelieved toassistthemm
their malpractices. Here, too,theowlagain appears,
butnow, instead ofthebirdbeing themessenger or
agent ofthetree spirit, itisthewizard {Aje) himself,

Witchcraft is,intheminds ofthe natives, the
chief cause ofsickness and death. They cannot,
they think, attribute these evils tothegods, unless
they occur insomeway special toagod; as,for
instance, when aman isstruck bylightning, inwhich
case theevent would beattributed toShango— or
contracts small-pox, when thedisease would beattri-
buted toShanpanna ;forthey arevery careful to
keep ongood terms with thegods, byscrupulously

observing tlieii- religious duties. They consequently
attribute sickness anddeath, other than death result-
ingfrom injury orviolence, tojDersons whohave for
badpurposes enhsted theservices ofevil spirits, that
istosay, towizards andwitches. Witches aremore
common than wizards, andhere, aselsewhere inthe
world, itistheoldest andmost hideous oftheir sex
whoareaccused ofthecrime.
Properly speaking, aperson charged with witch-
craft should besubjected totrialbyordeal, andthen,
iffound guilty, immediately executed;buttheexcited
populace, filled with superstitious terror, frequently
actswithout waiting forproof, andputs theaccused
todeath without trial. Curiously enough, thephe-
nomenon that sofrequently occurred inEngland, when
abelief inwitchcraft wasanarticle offaith, appears
here also;andoldwomen, accused ofbeing witches,
very often acknowledge that they are,andcharge
themselves with deaths which may have recently
occurred inthecommunity.
Amulets andcharms {pnde) arenumerous and of
various kinds. Some, like tlievo-sesao oftheEwe
tribes, arereally thebadges ofdifferent gods, such as
thea^ude, orironarmlet wornbyhunters, whoarethe
servitors ofOgun, god ofiron,andpossess novirtue
ofthemselves, being merely useful asserving to
remind thegods that thewearers areunder their
protection. Others areamulets proper, and are
believed toderive aprotecting power from thegods,
fromwhom they have, through theagency ofthe
priests, been obtained. Amulets aregenerally sewn

Thename ondemeans"oneinbondage," and is
compounded ofem,"aperson," or"one who,"

seems topoint totheformer existence ofabelief
similar tothatnowheldbytheTshi-tribes inregard
totheSuhman ;namely, thattheamulet isanimated
byanindwelling spirit,whohasbeen confined therein

Anonde fortheprotection oftheperson isworn on
thebody, being tiedround thewrist, neck, orankle,
orplaced inthehair. Others, fortheprotection of
property, arefastened tohouses, ortied tosticks and
stumps oftrees incultivated plots ofground. In
consequence oftheir being tiedontotheperson or

theactoftying orbinding, hasnowthemeaning of

Another word sometimes used toexpress amulet is
ogun, which, however, more properly means medicinal
preparation, poison, ormagical drug.

stitions.

TheYorubas have asuperstition which hasclose
points ofresemblance tothe"changeling "super-
stition ofNorthern Europe. Itisreferred toin
many folk-lore tales, andthefollowing isanexample.
"There lived atOtta"(avillage ontheRiver Ilo,
which isatributary oftheOgun) "awoman named
Bola, whohadamale child. When thechild was
small themother carried himonherbackwhen she
went tomarket, butwhen hebecame about nine
months oldsheused tolayhimdown onamat in
herhouse, fasten thedoor, andgotomarket by
herself. After this italways happened thatwhen
shereturned from themarket shefound that allthe
foodshehad leftinthehouse haddisappeared. This
seemed tohervery strange, andsheatfirst suspected
her neighbours, but shealways found thedoor-
fastening untouched, andwasunable tofathom the
mystery.
"Onedayaneighbour came toherand said,'Iam
going tothemarket atOrichi to-morrow morning
early, andtherefore must askyou torepaymethe
string ofcowries thatyousentyour littleboytoborrow
from me.' Bola,much astonished, declared that she
hadborrowed nocowries from thewoman, andhad
sentnoonetoher ;buttheneighbour persisted that
Bola's childhadcome toher,andhadborrowed astring
ofcowries inthename ofhismother.'Come, then,'
saidBola,'andseemychild.'
"Thetwowomen went into thehouse where the
childwassleeping onhismat. 'You seehim,' said

Bola,'there lieis,sleeping. Doyounotseethathe
isyettooyoung towalk ?How then could hecome
toyou ?Andhow could heaskyouforcowries,
seeing thathecannot yettalk ?'
"Theneighbour looked closely atthechild, and
thensolemnly declared that itwas really hewhohad
come toher,butthatwhen hecame hewasmuch
bigger thanhewasnow,andhad theappearance of
achild ofabout tenyears ofage.
"When Bolaheard thisshewasmuch distressed.
Shecould notdoubt herneighbour's word, andshe
feared that herchild must bepossessed byanevil
spirit. Shepaidtheneighbour thestring ofcowries,
andbegged hertosaynothing; then,when thechild's
father came tothehouse, shetoldhim thewhole
story.
"Thefather andmother decided tosearch intothe
mystery. Thefather, therefore, carefully hidhimself
inthehouse, onedaywhile themother andchildwere
out.Then Bolareturned tothehouse with thechild,
puthimdown onthemat, said tohim,'Sleep good
while Igotothemarket,' andthenwent out,and
fastened thedoor asusual.
"Scarcely hadBola gone, than thefather, from his
hiding-place, sawthebaby stand up,andbegin to
grow tillhebecame abigboy. Then hewent tothe
calabashes where thefoodwaskept,andwasbeginning
toeat it,when thefather came outfrom hishiding-
place.

waspossessed byaspirit. Hismother came back.
