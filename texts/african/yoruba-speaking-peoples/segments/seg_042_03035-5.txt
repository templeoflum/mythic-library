APPENDIX. 3y9
Alltheprimitive monosyllabic verbs havenowbeengrouped under
these eight roots, except those intheYoruba language which begin
with theletter ?•,andthefollowing :—
TSHI.
1.Je,toprotect, defend, receive, take. This probably belongs to
Eoot V. (c),and isavariation ofsho, towatch, observe, guard
(Yoruba).
2.Tyu, torub,brush, cleanse, wipe. Thismost likely isavaria-
tionofTsu,andbelongs toRootV.(e)or(g). IntheFanti dialect
ofTshi itispronounced Tchu.
GA.
3.She, tofear,beafraid of,respect.
EWE.
4.To,toown.
5.Gbe, toturn, twist, plait, braid.
6.Kpo, tolook, see,peep at,seek for,search.
7.Fo,tobeready.
8.Vu,totear, rend.
YORUBA.
9.Di, tobelessthan, tocompensate, retaliate. This probably
belongs toRoot VIII.
10.Lu, tobore, perforate, bediscovered.
11.Yi,tobetough orfibrous.
12.Yi,tomove, turn.
InTshi, Ga,orEwe theletter rnever commences aword, sothose
commencing with that letter inYoruba have doubtless undergone a
euphonic change. Insome instances aninitial consonant hasbeen
dropped. Thus Re, tobetired, faint, orweary, tofade, wither, be
red,wasnodoubt originally Bre, forthere isaTshiverbBre, tobe,
orget, tired, and also averb Bere, tobe,orget, red. Similarly,
Ru, toperish, belost, putrify, rot
;Re,tomoult, fall off"(ofleaves
orhair),Ro,towither, weaken, droop, beblighted, were probably
originally Bra, Bre,Bro, orPra, Pre,Pro,andbelong toRoot YII.

(e)and (f). Ri,todrown, sink, immerse, liasperhaps beenchanged
fromMi; Ro,tosound, excite, stimulate, from Bo,andRu, to
sprout, flourish, spring up,fromi^-w, orFra.
Eecapitulating oureight groups orroots,welindthat—
1.Fsignifies from, forth, coming from, issuing, appearing.
2.Hsignifies surface, exterior, outside.
3.Msignifies interior, inside, middle, midst.
4.Nsignifies spreading, extending, stretching.
5.Ssignifies changing, twisting, turning.
6.Ksignifies unity, completeness, being unique.
7.Bsignifies violence, exertion.
8.Dsignifies down, deep.
These coincide withtheprimitive consonants ofthefourlanguages.
Taking theconsonants which inTshi form, bymeans ofavowel, the
primitive monosyllabic verbs, wefindthem tobe—
b,d,f,g,h,j,k,m,n,p,s,t,v,w,y.
InGaandEweweget Iaswell,andinYoruba both Iand r,but
these arenodoubt innovations. Ofthe fifteen consonants ofthe
Tshilanguage—
phasbeen differentiated from &,orviceversa.

g,always hard, isavariation ofk.

yoriginated from eor i.
mandnwere nodoubt originally thesame, though the latter
seemsnow toconvey adifferent setofnotions.
The fifteen consonants maythusbereduced to(1) b,p ;(2)f,v;
(3)k,g ;(4)h;(5)s,sh,j;(6)d,t
;(7)m,n(or(7)mand
(8)n),which agree with theeight groups orroots.
Afewpeculiarities maybebriefly noted :—
(1)Thesame notion may beexpressed byoneroot inonelanguage
andbyatotally different root inanother language. Theexplanation
isthattheaction orcondition isregarded from adifi'ereni point of
view. Thus wegettheverb /m, tosmell (Ga), from thepoint of


APPENDIX. •iOl
vieT ofasmoll emitted (Hoot I.),* andImam, tosmell (Tshi), and
hive, tosmell (Ewe), from thepoint ofview ofasmell perceived
(Root IT.), ilfa, tobreathe (Ga), isbreathing regarded asan
internal action (Root III.) ;andha,tobreathe. (Ewe) isbreathing
regarded asamotion ofthesurface ofthebody. Ferre, tofear
(Tshi), andfe,fear, fright (Ga), arefearconsidered from thepoint of
view ofsomething terrible, harmful, orbadappearing orcoming
forth andcausing fear;while ehu, fear(Tshi), isfearconsidered asa
condition ofthebody. This peculiarity isperhaps best seen inthe
case ofverbs meaning tospeak, utter words. Ka,tospeak, and he,
tosay, tell(Ga);Ka-sa, tospeak, talk'(Tshi);and ke,toexclaim
(Yoruba), refer tospeech regarded asasuccession ofwords uttered
singly andone after theother (Root VI. ).Be, totell, narrate
(Tshi);betotell, relate (Ewe);and hi,toask, enquire, question
(Ga) ;refer tospeech regarded asbetween two ormore persons in
juxta position (Root VII.). Ba, tobeg, beseech (Ga), and he,to
beg,beseech (Yoruba) may likewise beconsidered asspeech regarded
asthemedium ofconversation between twopersons, though these
verbs appear more properly tohave reference tothebending orpro-
strating ofbody which isalways practised bysupplicants. Do,to
say, speak, tell(Ewe), isspeech regarded asconnected with the
depths ofthemonth orthroat (Root VIII.). Se,tosay,andshu, to
speak (Tshi);se,todeny, and so,totalk, tell(Yoruba);isspeech
regarded asasuccession ofchanges ofsounds orwords (Root V.).
(2)Notions which areclosely allied andwhich wemight reason-
ablyexpect tofindexpressed bythesame root inanyonelanguage
areoften expressed bydifferent roots. Thus "fire," and"toflame,"
arenotions closely allied, yetinYoruba "fire"isina,which iseither
from na,tospread, extend, orfrom na,towaste (Root IV.);and
"toflame"isjo,which hasreference tothetwisting, turning, and
dancing offlames (Root V.). The verb "toburn "canonly be
expressed byacombination ofthetwo inthecompound verb jana.
InEwe,"fire"isdso,"the twister," or"the dancer" (Root V.);
while"toburn "isfia,wliich refers tosomething appearing or
coming forth, whence afi,ashes (Root I.).
(3)Thesame verb can often beused toexpress actions which
"Whence /«,burial, because corpses arealways keptsome days before inter,
ment.
2D


402 THEYORUB A-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
appear tobediametrically opposed. Thus theGaverbnme(Root
III.), canbeused tomean "toopen," or"toshut." Theexplana-
tion isthat theverb really expresses anaction affecting theinterior
orinside ofsomething, andopening exposes theinside while shutting
hides itfrom view. Theremainder ofthespoken sentence explains
tothehearer thesense inwhich itisused, or,failing that, theexact
meaning isindicated bygesture.* Ifaman were tosay"Inmea
boxandtook clothes out," itwould bemanifest tohisaudience that
nmewasthere used asaverb "toopen." Similarly theverbdsa
(Ga) isused toexpress "todivide," or"tojoin." itreally means
"toeffect achange," and socanonly beused with regard tothe
division ofthings formerly absolutely united, orthejoining of
things completely separate. Itcould not, forinstance, beused to
express ajoining ofthetwohands ofthesame psrson.
(4) Ifthesame verbmay express notions which appear tobe
diametrically opposed, ofcourse thesame rootmay. Thus, under
Hoot v.,wefind theTshi verbs so,toseize, catch, takehold of,and
si,tostand, put, place, set;both ofwhich primarily mean achange of
position. From thenotion oftaking hold of,taking into thehands,
comes that oftaking up,lifting, which isseen inthesecondary verbs
soa,tolift,carry, and sorre, torise,ascend;and finally socomes to
beused asapreposition "on,upon, above, up."Byasimilar process
thenotion ofstanding, putting, placing, leads toputting outofthe
hands andputting down, sothatfimiUy from siwegetthenoun asi,
bottom, lower part,which isused asapreposition oradverb inthe
sense of"under, beneath, below." Thusupon orabove, andunder or
below, areexpressed bythesame root. Possibly the fact that our
verb "torise"really belongs tothesame root astheoldGerman
risan, to fall, French arriser, tolet fall,f might besimilarly
explained.
*Ifalanguage contained many words such asthis, itiscomprehensible that
conversation would bedifficult inthedark,when thegesture necessary tomake
themeaning clear could notbeseen. Ithasbeen asserted thatatribenearCape
Palmas isinthiscondition, buttheassertion requires corroboration.
