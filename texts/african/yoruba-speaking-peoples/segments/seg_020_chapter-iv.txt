In tliemjtlis oftlieorigin oftlie various gods
described intlie lasttwochapters weprobably see
theresult oftheindwelling- spirit theory having been
lost sight of.Aslong asagodwasaccepted tobe
theanimating principle orspiritual entity ofsome
natural object orfeature, hisorigin required noex-
planation, forhisexistence wasbound upwith the
feature orobject, and, ifthequestion wasthought of
atall,hemust have been, inthenative mind, coeval
with theorigin oftheworld. When, however, ashas
been thecasewithmost ofthedeities worshipped by
theYoruba tribes asawhole, thegods ceased tobe
identified 'with local objects ornatural phenomena,
some other explanation oftheir origin became neces-
sary;forman,however lowhemaybeinthescale of
civilisation, isalways desirous ofknowing thereasons

ticular isofavery inquisitive turn ofmind. Then,

inacommonly accepted version.
Tlie deities Obatala andOdudna represent, say
thepriests, Heaven andEarth. Olorun istliereal
Heaven-god, orSky-god, answering to tlieEVve
Mawn, bnt lieisnowalmost pushed outo£sight, and
Obatala, amore active agent, acts forhim. The dif-
ference between Olorun andObatala appears tobe
thattheformer isthepersonal divine firmament, and
the latter ananthropomorphic sky-god, alater con-
ception; andweperhaps here seearepetition ofthe
process bywhich inthereligion ofancient Greece
Kroiios supplanted Uranus. Obatala, orHeaven,
marries Odudna, orEarth,* andhastwo children,
named Aganju andYemaja, who, according tothe
priests, represent Land andWater. These twointer-
marry andhave ason,Orungan, "Air," theregion
between thesolidfirmament andtheearth. Orungan
ravishes hismother Yemaja, who, while endeavouring
toescape from further outrage, fallsandbursts open,
whereupon anumber ofgodsemerge from hergaping
body.
Thegodswhose origin isthusaccounted forasthe
offspring ofYemaja, areofvarious types. The Sea-
god(Olokun), theThunder-god (Shango), theSun,
theMoon, theLagoon (Olosa), thethree river-god-

Shankpanna, god ofsmall-pox, ispersonified pesti-
lence, andbelongs toanother type ;while Dada,

common origin alike totheancient godsandtothose
which aremore modern.
There are,however, other godswhodonotbelong
tothisfamily circle ;that is,they arenotdescendants
ofObatala andOdudua, sothemythological scheme
isincomplete, noattempt being made toaccount for
their origin. These gods aretheGrod ofDivination
(Ifa), theForest-god (Aroni), thePhallic-god (Elegba),
theHarmattan Wind (Oye), theRainbow (Oshumare),
thetutelary deity ofhouseholds (Olarosa), thegodof
Medicine (Osanhin), and Shigidi. These also areof
various types. TheHarmattan Wind andtheRain-
bow areISTature-gods oftheoldorder, andAroni, god
offorests, ofthenew. Olarosa andOsanhin are
tutelary deities, andShigidi ispersonified nightmare.
Ifawasprobably originally theGod offecundation,
though now hischief function istoforetell thefuture.
Elegba, primarily aphallic divinity, seems tobe
gradually becoming apersonification ofevil,andhere
weperhaps seeatendency towards Dualism, which
inthefuture might, ifundisturbed, result inElegba
becoming theEvilDeity, andObatala orIfatheGrood,

Theincompleteness ofttescheme seems, ashasbeen
said, toshow'that themyth ofYemaja iscomparatively
recent, and this issupported bythefact that the
myth itself isnotuniversally accepted initsentirety.
Shango, forexample, issaidbysome tobeofmde-
pendent origin, likeIfa ;andOdudua, themother of
Yemaja, according tothemyth, isbyothers included
inthenumber ofthosewhosprang fromYemaja's
body. Nogeneral consensus ofopinion hasyetbeen
arrived at,butthemyth ofYemaja istheonlyone
thatholds the field,andnodoubt incourse oftime

Obatala andOdudua.
Wefindthesamewant ofaccord inthemyths ofthe
origin ofman. According tosome, Obatala made the
firstmanandwoman outofclayormud,whence he
hasobtained his titles ofAlamorere andOrisha
Kpokpo; while, according toothers, the first pair
came, with thegods, from thebody ofYemaja. Al-
though thefirststorysomewhat resembles theaccount
oftheorigin ofman given intheBook ofGenesis,
there isnoreason forsupposing ittobeborrowed.

origin ofmankind, hascome totheconclusion that

images being ordinarily made ofclayevenwhen the
artshavesomewhat advanced, thiswould bethesub-
stance which themyth-makers would introduce into
theirmyths describing theorigin ofthe first pair, a
connection ofideas between clayandthehuman form
already existing.*
Thesecond story, which cannot beanyolder than
themyth ofYemaja, ofwhich itisapart, issufficiently
precise togive thename ofthe first couple, that
oftheman being Obalofun (Lord ofSpeech), and
that ofthewoman lya(Mother). After coming out
ofthegoddess atIfe,they settled there, andhada
numerous progeny, which increased and multiplied
tillthewhole earth waspopulated, hence itisthat
Ife isconsidered thecradle ofthehuman race. Of
course Obalofun andlyawere Yorubas, for itisa
peculiarity ofevery uncivilised people tobelieve that
thefirstmanandwoman were oftheir race.
Another tradition, though itmakes Ifetheplace
oforigin oftheYoruba tribes, represents itasbeing
colonised bypersons migrating from the interior.
This tradition isperhaps adim recollection ofahis-
torical fact, historical, that is,insofarthat the
Yoruba tribes probably didintheremote pastcome

wliicli theywere found atthecommencement ofthe
present century; forthecognate Tshi tribes ofthe
Gold Coast alsohave atradition ofamigration from
theinterior. Most probably thetwotraditions refer
toagreat southward movement oftheoriginal stock
fromwhich theTshi, Ga,Ewe,andYomba tribes are
descended, andwhich, starting from some central
point intheinterior, spread outinfan-shape till it
reached thesea-coast. The tradition oftheYoruba
migration isasfollows.
Long agoacertain person living inthefarinterior
sent fifteen people from hiscountry togotothe
south, andwiththem came, ofhisown free will,one
named Okambi,* who afterwards became the first
King ofYoruba. When theywere leaving, theper-
sonwho sentthem gaveOkambi aslave, atrumpeter
named Okinkin,t afowl, andsomething tiedupina
piece ofblack cloth. They journeyed forsome time,
andwhen theyopened thegate ofthesouth and
passed intotheunknown country, theyfound nothing
butwater spread outbefore them. At firstthey
thought ofreturning, butfearing tlieanger ofthe
person whohad sentthem, they entered thewater;
and, finding itquite shallow, waded onthrough it.
Thisthey didforsome time untilOkinkin thetrum-
peter sounded histrumpet, inaccordance with the
instructions theperson had given, andthereby re-
minded Okambi ofthesomething tiedupinblack
cloth, which was tobeopened when thetrumpet

inwhich position acertain person named Okiki fsaw

sent out.When hesawthem, Okiki reminded
Okinkin thetrumpeter that itwas hisduty tosound
thetrumpet again, whereupon hesounded it,and
Okambi untied thepiece ofblack cloth asecond time.
When itwasopened, earth fellfrom it,and, drying
upthewater, made asmall mound. Thefowl that
thepersonage hadgiven Okambi then flewontothe
mound andscratched theearth hereandthere, and
wherever theearth fell itdriedupthewater. When
therewasagood space covered with earth, Okambi
came down from the tree, bringing withhim his

from thewater afterwards became Ife,and,some
time after, three brothers setoutfrom there in
different directions, tomake fresh discoveries. When

This tradition isvague andmeagre ofdetail, the
only points brought outbeing that acertain number
ofpersons migrated southward from theinterior, and
found aregion covered with water. This latter de-
tail,however, strongly supports thetheory thatareal
migration took place; forthelarge stretches ofshallow
water ofthelagoon system, which during therainy
season areenormously extended bytheinundation of
thelow-lying portions ofthesurrounding country,
could scarcely have failed toexcite thewonder ofa
people accustomed totheplateaus andmountain
ranges oftheinterior, andtoleave alasting impres-
sionupon their memories.
