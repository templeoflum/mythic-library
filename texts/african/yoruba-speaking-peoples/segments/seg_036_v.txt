kingwanted her,andshe stillrefused.
Tortoise came totheking, andsaid tohim, "She

andwent tofetch water. Tortoise, seeing this,took
hishoe,andcleared thepath that ledtothespring.

When Buje, theslender, had filled herpot,she
came back. Shesaw thesnake inthepath, and
called out"Hi !hi !Come and killthissnake."

And then Tortoise slipped hislegsdown over her

theking. Hesaid, "DidInot tellyouthat Iwould
have Buje, theslender ?Call allthepeople ofthe
town toassemble onthe fifth day,andyou willhear

When itwasthe fifth day,theking sent outhis
crier tocall allthepeople together. Thepeople came.
Tortoise cried out,"Everybody wanted Buje, the

"Wehaveheard that Tortoise isyourhusband ;isit

Buje, theslender, wasashamed, and could not
answer. Shecovered herhead with her cloth, and
ranaway intothebush.
And there shewaschanged intotheplant called
