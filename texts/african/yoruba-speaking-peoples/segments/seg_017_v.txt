oncemore fledtotlieeast.
Akitoye died inSeptember, poisoned, itwas said,
bytheslave trade party, and liissonDocemo was,
tkrongli British influence, appointed hissuccessor.
Kosoko, whohadagain found anasylum with the
chief ofEpi,refused toaccept thisarrangement, and
continued toharass Docemo andtheLagos people
untilbyanagreement made inJanuary, 1854, he
was recognised asKing ofPalma andLekki, on
condition ofrenouncing allclaim tothesovereignty
ofLagos. InAugust, 1861, Docemo ceded Lagos
tothe British inconsideration ofapension of
£1,000 ayear, andLagos thusbecame aBritish
possession; but itisdoubtful ifthecession was
altogether voluntary onDocemo's part, forduring
the firstfewyears succeeding thesignature ofthe
treaty hemade several protests against it.
In1860 anewwarbroke out inthe interior.
Ijaye, animportant town ofYoruba, declared itself
independent ofthe Alafin, who called upon the
Ibadans toassist him inreducing ittoallegiance.
TheIbadans complied, whereupon theEgbas sided
with Ijaye ;butthese allies sustained asevere defeat
atthehands oftheYorubas andIbadans, losing, it
issaid, 40,000 inkilled and prisoners, and Ijaye
wasdestroyed onMarch I7th, 1862.
Uptothistime theEgbas hadbeen considered
theproteges oftheBritish, andgreat interest had
been taken inthewelfare ofAbeokuta, which was
regarded asthebulwai'k ofChristianity inWest
Africa. This interest dated from about 1838,when

anumber ofEgba slaves, wlio liadbeen liberated
atSierra Leone from captured slave vessels, re-
turned toAbeokuta andasked tkat missionaries
miglit besent totliem.AProtestant mission was
establislied there in1848, andwhen anattack on
thetownwasthreatened byGezo, King ofDahomi,
in1850, Mr. Beecroft, theBritish Consul forthe
Bights, andCommander Forbes, E.N., were sent to
Agbomi toendeavour topersuade theking toabandon
hisdesign. Themission completely failed, andGrezo
attacked Abeokuta onMarch 3rd,1851, butwas re-
pulsed withsome loss.* The British occupation of
Lagos in1861 putanend tothefriendly feelings of
theBgbas, who resented theprotection granted by
thecolonial authorities tofugitive slaves fromAbeo-
kuta,andobjected tothestoppage oftheexport slave
trade, inwhich theyhadbeen largely engaged. They
seem alsotohavehadsome suspicion that their inde-
pendence wasthreatened, forwhen inMay, 1861, it
wasproposed tosendsome trained gunners ofthe
2nd"West India Regiment toAbeokuta toinstruct
thepeople intheuseofsome guns thathadbeen
presented bytheBritish Grovernment, andtolend aid
during another attack thatwasnowthreatened by
Dahomi, theEgbas made excuse after excuse, and
finally declined toreceive them. In1862 they fur-
therdisplayed their ill-will bymolesting andplunder-
ingseveral native traders from Lagos, and, asthey
refused reparation, theGrovernor ofLagos, in1863,
blockaded alltheroads leading toAbeokuta.
In1863, Kosoko, chief ofPalma andLekki, desired

toreturn toLagos, and, inorder toobtain per-
mission, ceded Palnia andLekki to tlie British.
The Possn, orchief o£Epi, raised objections to
this cession. Hehad, itappeared, certain terri-
torial rights over these places, and their cession,
moreover, shuthim offfrom thesea.Asherefused
tocede hisrights, anexpedition, consisting ofthree
officers and124men ofthe2ndand3rdWest India
Regiments, proceeded inH.M.S. Investigator toEpi,
where thetroops andarocket party ofone officer
andfourteen seamen landed. The natives offered a
strenuous resistance, andtheexpeditionary force suf-
fered aloss ofthreemen killed and three officers
andtwenty-eight menwounded, butthetown was
destroyed. After thisthechief renounced allfurther
claim toterritory south ofthelagoon. InJuly,
1863, thechiefs ofBadagry likewise ceded alltheir
territory totheBritish.
Thewarbetween theEgbas andIbadans caused
bytheaffair ofIjayehadbeen carried oninadesul-
torymanner since 1862; butin1864, after therepulse
oftheDahomis from before Abeokuta onMarch 15th,*
theJebus, whohadhitherto adopted thepolicy of
excluding allstrangers from their territory, andhad
lived incomplete isolation, shut offbytheir forests
from therest ofthetribes, joined theEgbas, andthe
warwasprosecuted withmore vigour. TheJebus
ofIkoradu, atown atthenorthern exti'emity ofthe
Lagos lagoon, refused tojoin their fellow-tribesmen
inthealliance with theEgbas, their reason being that
their interests were identified with those ofthepeople

ofLagos, and tliat tliey liad suffered equally with
tliem from tliecessation oftrade caused bythemal-
treatment oftraders bytheBgbas. Inrevenge^ the
Egbas, early in1865, despatched toIkoradu an
army of12,000 men,which besieged thetown, and,
after thenative fashion, threw uptwoentrenched
camps against it.TheColonial Grovernment, alarmed
atthenearapproach ofthis force, andappealed to
bytheIkoradus foraid,warned theEgbas todesist,
andordered them toreturn totheirown country.
TheEgbas sent insulting messages inreply, anda
force ofsome 280men, consisting ofthe5th"West
India B-egiment andtheLagos Police, was accord-
ingly sent against them, which stormed thecamps
androuted theEgbas withheavy loss,onMarch 29th,
1865. This affair ofcourse onlyserved towiden the
breach between theBritish andtheEgbas, thelatter,
besides, conceived that the Colonial Grovernment
encouraged theannual raids ofDahomi uponEgba
territory;and, in1867, they expelled allthemission-
aries fromAbeokuta, and cut offallrelations with
theBritish.
Itseems that aletter, purporting tobesigned bya
hostile chief, fellintothehands oftheEgbas, who
knew thatthechief could notwrite, andfancied they
recognised thehandwriting asthat ofaProtestant
missionary whohadformerly lived inAbeokuta. The
missionaries inAbeokuta were thereupon accused of
betraying theEgbas totheir enemies ;there wasa
popular tumult, andthemobhowled fortheir blood.
Itwasonlywith great difficulty thatthechiefs and

whowore immediately expelled from tlietown, and
their houses andchurches destroyed. In1880, the
French Roman Catholic missionaries obtained leave to
establish amission inAbeokuta, which thenceforward
fellmore under theinfluence oftheFrench.
The interior continued tobedisturbed byinter-
tribal wars until about 1870, when affairs calmed
down, butin1877 theBgbas plundered some Ibadan
traders, andtheIbadans sentanarmy toavenge the
outrage. Upon thistheJebus renewed their former
alhance with theBgbas, and Ijesa andtheEkiti
tribes, which hadnowbeen under therule ofIbadan
since 1858, seized theopportunity forrebellion, astep
which wassoon followed byadeclaration ofwar
against Ibadan byUorin. TheMohammedans of
Ilorin rapidly invaded thecountry and laid siege to
Ofa, atown situated some twenty miles tothenorth-
east ofthe city ofIbadan, andtheIbadans were
obliged towithdraw theirarmy ofinvasion fromBgba
inorder todefend theirown territory, which wasnow
threatened from three sides. TheBgbas, however,
didnotfollow uptheretreating force, and, indeed,
took nofurther part inthewar,theybeing held in
check bythefear ofleaving Abeokuta unprotected
against Dahomi, which power hadbeen inthehabit
ofmaking annual demonstrations initsvicinity for
some years past; andthestruggle wascontinued
between Ibadan, ontheoneside,andIlorin, Ijesa, the
Bkiti tribes, andJebu, ontheother.
Ibadan secured thesupport ofModakeke and Ife,
twopopulous towns situated onhillsontheopposite
sides ofasmall stream, tothesouth-west ofIjesa, and


INTRODUCTORY, 23
tliewarcontinued forsome years without anygreat
advantage being gained byeither side. TheModa-
kekes were staunch alHes oftheIbadans, butthe
sympathies oftheIfeswere rather with theIjesaand
theEkiti tribes, withwhom theyhadbeen inaUiance
durino- thewarwhich terminated in1858. Their
situation, however, madethem afraid ofcoming toan
open rupture with Ibadan, so,inresponse tothe
demand oftheIbadans, they sent acontingent to
theIbadan camp, but atthesame time also secretly
sentanequal force tothecamp oftheIjesas and
Ekitis. This double game could notlong escape
detection, and in1882 theModakekes, assisted bya
force ofIbadans, attacked Ife,andthetown, which
wasregarded asholy,andthecradle oftheYoruba
race,wasdestroyed. The Ifesnowopenly joined the
enemies ofIbadan, butmost ofthetribes hadbythis
timebecome heartily sick oftheprolonged struggle,
andin1883 abody ofJebuswhowereencamped on
theOmiRiver made peace with theIbadans ontheir
own account, andreturned home. TheAwujale of
JebuOde,paramount chief ofthetwoJebu provinces,
wassoalarmed atthisevent thathefledfrom the
town ofJebu Ode,which hewasbylawforbidden to
leave, andtook refuge atEpi. Here hewas invited
bytheJebu elders tocommit suicide ;heproved
docile, andanewAwujale was elected bythepeace
party. His election, however, wasnotapproved by
thewarparty, andastrong force ofJebus, under the
seriJci, orsecond war chief, stillkept the field against
Ibadan.
Thewar,which was really only asuccession of

skirmis]ies atlong intervals, dragged on till1884,
when tlieGrovernor ofLagos wasasked tomediate
andsecure apeace. In1886 thisrequest wasrenewed
byallthecombatants except Ilorin, andtheG-overnor
accordingly acted asmediator, with theresult that
representatives from thedifferent tribes assembled at
Lagos, andonJune 4thanagreement was signed, of
which thefollowing were thechief points :
(1)Ibadan, Ijesa, andtheEkiti tribes torespec-
tively retain their independence.
(2)Thefour Ekiti towns ofOtan, Iresi, Ada,and
Igbajo tobeceded toIbadan, ontheunderstanding
that thepresent inhabitants were atliberty toleave
them.
(3)Thetown ofModakeke tobereconstructed on
territory between theOshun andOba rivers, tothe
north ofitsthen situation ;such oftheinhabitants as
elected topassunder therule ofIbadan moving to
thenew site,and those who preferred tobecome
subject toIfeliving inIfeterritory, butnot in
Modakeke, which wastobedealt withbytheIfes as
theythought fit.
Thebelligerents were atthistime established insix
large camps, thechief being those atKijiandOke
Mesi, situated about amileapart upon opposite sides
ofamountainous valley inthenorth ofIjesa, the
former occupied bytheIbadans andthelatter bythe
Ijesas andEkiti tribes. TheIbadans hadanother
camp atIkirun, about fifteen miles west ofIviji,
between thetwoarms oftheErinle River, where they
confronted theIlorins, whowereencamped atOfa,
eighteen miles tothenorth. TheModakekes, with


INTRODUCTORY. 25
anIbadan contingent, were atMoclakeke watching
theIfes,who,with theJebu force under the Serild,
were encamped about two miles tothesouth. In
accordance with theterms oftheagreement, Com-
missioners were sent totheinterior bytheGrovem-
ment ofLagos totake steps tobreak upthecamps.
These proved tobetowns rather than camps, since
they consisted oftheordinary mud-walled houses of
thenatives, were defended byloop-holed mud walls,
andcontained many thousands ofwomen andchildren.
TheIbadan camp atKiji,which hadbeen inexistence
forseven years, was estimated tocontain between
50,000 and60,000 inhabitants, atleast two-thirds of
whom were non-combatants, andtheOkeMesicamp
40,000. These twocamps were evacuated andburned
onSeptember 28th, 1886, their occupants returning to
theirformer homes ;butanunexpected obstacle was
now offered bytheModakekes, who firstasked fora
delay, andthen positively refused tocarry outthe
agreement and quit their town, alleging that they
could notleave thespotwhere their forefathers were
buried. The factwasthey feared that ifthey
remained onthe soil ofIfe,theIfeswould revenge
themselves uponthem forthedestruction oftheholy
city,andthat iftheymoved toIbadan territory the
Ibadans would enslave them ;and after some further
delay, theCommissioners, finding there wasnopro-
spect oftheModakekes keeping their promise, returned
toLagos. The Ilorins hadnotbeen parties tothe
agreement ofJune 4th, but theCommissioners
endeavoured toarrange apeace between them and
theIbadans, and induce them toabandon their

camps atOfaandIkirim;this, however, didnot
succeed, andthewarbetween these two tribes con-
tinued.
Inthemeantime, while theinterior hadbeen dis-
turbed bjthese protracted native wars, thecolony of
Lagos had received further extensions, Ketonu, a
district ontheeastern shores ofLakeDenham Waters,
having attherequest ofthe natives, who feared
Trench aggression, been declared British inJanuary,
1880 ;while Appa, which liesbetween Ketonu and
Badagry, wasplaced within theBritish jurisdiction in
1883. ByLetters Patent, dated 13thJanuary, 1886,
Lagos wasmade asej)arate colony, independent ofthe
government oftheGrold Coast.
In1888, inconsequence ofthereported intrigues
oftheFrench inAbeokuta, whowere said tohave
offered totolerate slavery, and topayanannual sub-
sidy, iftheEgbas would place themselves under French
protection, efforts weremade tohave thelimits of
British andFrench territory andspheres ofinfluence
defined, with theresult that articles ofarrangement
forthedelimitation oftheEnglish andFrench posses-
sions ontheWest Coast ofAfrica were signed at
Paris, onAugust 10th, 1889. The fourth article
defined theterritories and spheres ofinfluence on
theSlave Coast, the line ofdemarcation being the
meridian which intersects the territory ofPorto
Novo attheAjarra Creek, andextending from the
sea totheninth degree ofnorth latitude. By
thisarrangement theeastern half ofAppa, with
itscapital, andPokra, became British, while the
western half ofAppa, together withKetonu, became

Frencli. Egba andOkeodan fell-within tlieBritish
sphere ofinfluence, andKetn within that ofthe
French.
Thewarbetween Ibadan and Ilorin stilllingered
on,and, in1889, Mr.Millson, theAssistant Colonial
Secretary, was sent totheinterior toendeavour to
arrange ameeting between theGrovernor ofLagos and
thebelligerents inorder tobring these hostilities
toanend, but, asthe chiefs declined toenter into
anynegotiations with theCommissioner, themission
failed.
Although Abeokuta hadnowbeen definitely placed
within theBritish sphere ofinfluence therewasno
improvement intherelations between theEgbas and
theLagos government. InJanuary, 1891, agreat
political meeting washeld atAbeokuta, atwhich the
oldcharge thatthegovernment connived atorencou-
raged theannual inroads ofDahomi wasrevived, and
some European missionaries were expelled. ACom-
missioner from thegovernment wassent toAbeokuta
inAugust, butachieved noresults, and inJanuary,
1892, theEgbas declared alltheir trade routes, both
tothecoast andtotheinterior, closed, andceased all
commercial relations with thecolony. Afurther
attempt onthepart ofthegovernment toopen nego-
tiations wasmade inthefollowing month, butcom-
pletely failed, and atameeting ofEgba chiefs, held
onthe13th ofApril, theproposal toreopen thetrade
routes toLagos wasunanimously negatived.
While affairs hadbeen inthisunsatisfactory state

ence, adispute with theJebus hadsprung upinthe

east. TlieBjinrin market, situated about tenmiles
east ofBpi,wasclosed bytheAwujale ofJebuOde
onaccount ofsome disagreement with thepeople of
Lagos ;andthough, inOctober, 1890, inconsequence
ofrepresentations madebythegovernment ofLagos,
itwasformally opened bytheGrovernor andrepresen-
tatives sentbytheAwujale, theJebusmade thiscon-
cession unwillingly, andhadnointention whatever of
departing from their policy ofexcluding foreigners
from the interior oftheir country. Consequently,
when, inMay, 1891, theActing Governor, Captain
Denton, O.M.Gr., leftLagos withanescort ofHausas
toproceed onamission toJebu Ode,with theobject
ofcoming tosome agreement fortheopening ofthe
country- tocommerce, theJebus refused toallow the
party toenter their territory, ontheplea thatthey
feared hostile action. TheAwujale notonlyrefused
totreat, butrejected thepresents offered onbehalf
oftheBritish Grovernment, fearing, nodoubt, that
toaccept them would entail some concession onhis
part.
Upon this affair being referred totheHome Grovern-
ment, theGrovernor wasinstructed todemand an
apology from theJebus fortheso-called insult offered
totheActing Grovernor, andtoinsistupon afreeright
ofwaythrough Jebu country. TheAwujale wasto
beinformed that, ifthese terms were notcomplied
with, forcewould beused. LiDecember, 1891, this
ultimatum wasconveyed totheAwujale byanofficer
oftheLagos Constabulary, andtheAwujale then
consented tosend toLagos representatives fully
empowered tomake theapology andsign atreaty.


INTRODUCTOJtY, 29
InJanuary, 1892, tlierepresentatives arrived, and
onthe21stmade aformal apology, andsigned an
agreement tomaintain afreeandunrestricted right-
of-way forpersons andgoods tlirougli Jebu territory;
tlieGovernment oftlieColony undertaking topay
tlieJebns anannual sum of£500 incompensation
fortheduties theyhadbeenaccustomed tolevyon
goods.
Forashort time theJebus observed their treaty
engagements, and onemember oftheChurch
Missionary Society was allowed topass through
JebuOdeonhisway totheinterior; butwhen,
soon afterwards, inthemonth ofFebruary, another
missionary attempted topassthrough thecapital he
was ill-used and sent back. Aparty ofIbadan
carriers, whosought topassthrough from thenorth,
was alsoturned back. TheAwujale asserted that
theIbadans hadbeen insolent, but itwasevident
that theyoung men ofthetribewere determined to
maintain theoldJebu policy ofisolation. The
Jebus were aturbulent andproud nation, andthey
considered itdisgraceful toobserve engagements
which hadbeen extorted fromthem bythreats. In
consequence ofthese breaches ofthe treaty, the
Inspector-aeneral oftheLagos Constabulary was
sent totheAwujale toaskforexplanations. He
landed atItoike, butwasnotallowed toproceed
anyfurther, theAwujale sending tosaythathedid
notwish"topalaver"with theLagos aovernment.
TheHome Grovernment now authorised theem-
ployment offorce. Special-service officers were sent
outfrom England, two officers and155men ofthe

Gold Coast Constabulary were ordered from Accra,
and tliree officers and ninety-nine men oftlie 1st
Battalion West India Eegiment were despatched from
Sierra Leone. These, with 165 oftheLagos Con-
stabulary, andanIbadan Contingent of100men,
making atotal combatant force ofabout 500, left
Lagos, under thecommand ofColonel T.C.Scott,
C.B., onthe12th ofMay,anddisembarked atBpi
without opposition onthedayfollowing. Onthe
16th thecolumn advanced from Epi ;there wasa
slight skirmish atPobo onthesame day,another at
Kpashida next day,andonthe18th the force
encamped atMajoda.
Next morning theJebus were found inposition,
ready todefend thepassage oftheOshun Eiver, and
anaction commenced at7a.m. The fire ofthe
Jebus notonly swept the ford, which theyhad
deepened bydigging outthebed ofthestream, but
also thenarrow bush-track which led to it,and
wasexceedingly heavy andwell sustained. Itwas
reported thattheyhadoffered ahuman sacrifice tothe
goddess oftheriver, toenlist heraidagainst the
invaders, and thishadsopowerful aneffectupon the
superstitious minds oftheconstabulary, that forafull
hour theycould notbeinduced toenter thestream;
and itwasnotuntil theWest Indians, whohadbeen
held inreserve, were ordered uptolead theway
across theOshun, that theenemy's position was
carried. Between theriver andthevillage ofMas'-
bon,which thevictors entered shortly after 10a.m.,
wasfound thecamp which theJebus hadoccupied
theprevious night, Itwasestimated tohaveaccom-


INTRODUCTORY. 31
modated from 5,000 to6,000 persons, and asabout
lialf theoccupants ofanative camp arewomen and
non-combatants, thepassage oftheriver was pro-
bably disputed byabout 3,000 men. TheJebu losses
were supposed tobesevere, buttheBritish force lost
only three killed andtwenty-four wounded, exclusive
ofcarriers.
Onthe20th ofMay theadvance wasresumed soon
after daybreak, and,being metbyaflagoftruce, the
force occupied thetown ofJebuOde thesame day
without resistance. Itwasabout four miles incir-
cumference, defended byamud wall,andcontained
intime ofpeace about 15,000 inhabitants, allof
whom, with theexception oftheAwujale and his
immediate following, hadnow fled.Onthe25th,
theGrovernor arrived from Lagos toconduct the
negotiations with theAwujale, whomade complete
submission, alleging that theyoung menhadfought
contrary tohiswishes andorders;and,onthe30th
and31st, theexpeditionary force, with theexception
ofthree officers and140men oftheConstabulary, who
remained inoccupation ofJebu Ode, left forLagos,
onecolumn marching through Sagamu andIkoradu,
andanother through Itoike.
The trade routes ontheeastwerenow opened,
butthose through Egba country stillremained closed,
and forsome time itwasthought that amilitary
expedition against Abeokuta would benecessary.
Theeasewithwhich theJebus, whowere considered
averypowerful tribe, hadbeen punished, had,how-
ever,made aprofound impression upon thenative
mind, andmany British subjects ofEgba descent at

Lagos, fearing that, iftlie oliiefs ofAbeokuta main-
tained tlieir unfriendlj attitude, tlieindependence of
Egba would belost, strongly impressed upon tlieir
compatriots tlienecessity ofcoming toterms. In
consequence, theEgbas declared their willingness to
receive theGrovernor, Mr. Carter, andcome tosome
arrangement, with theresult that onthe18th of
January, 1893, atreaty was signed atAbeokuta.
TheEgbas undertook torefer alldisputes between
themselves andBritish subjects totheGrOvernor for
settlement, toestablish complete freedom oftrade
between Egba country andLagos, and toclose no
trade route without theconsent oftheGrOvernor.
They alsopromised toabolish human sacrifice, and
nottocedeanyportion ofEgba territory toaforeign
power without theconsent oftheBritish. Onthe
other hand. Great Britain guaranteed that theinde-
pendence ofEgba should befully recognised, andno
annexation ofanyportion ofitbemade without the
consent oftheEgba authorities.
There isaconsiderable difference between the
Yoruba-speaking Peoples and theEwe-speaking
Peoples. We stillfindthecharacteristics which were
dominant among thelatter, namely, indolence, impro-
vidence, and duplicity, butthey arenolonger so
pronounced, probably, almost certainly, because life
andproperty aremore secure. TheYoruba hasmore
independence ofcharacter than theTshis, G-as, or
Ewes, andservility israre.Heeven hasthesenti-
ments ofnationality andpatriotism, andthough these
areregarded with disfavour bytheColonial Grovern-

due tothephysical characteristics ofthecountry.
There being but little forest, except intheeastern
districts, commimication iseasy, and theterritory
ismoreover opened upbyseveral rivers. Instead,
then, ofbeing dispersed inanumber ofinconsiderable
hamlets, which aremere specks inavastandimpene-
trable forest, theYorubas have been able tolivein
towns, each ofwhich iswithin easycommunication
ofothers. Nodoubt their superior social instincts
firstcaused them tocongregate intowns, andnow
many generations oftown lifehasfurther developed
them. There iseven acertain amount ofloyalty in
theYoruba, aquality forwhich onemight look in
vainamong theEwe tribes. Without saying that
theYorubas aremore intelligent, wecansafely say
that their intellect ismore cultivated ;theasperities
ofsavage lifearesoftened, thesharper angles are
worndown byfrequent intercourse with their fellow-
men,andatthepresent daythey arecertainly the
leading people inWest Africa.
