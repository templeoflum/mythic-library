(1)Olokun.
Olokun {oni-ohun, liewlioowns thesea), "Lord oftlie
Sea," istliesea-god oftlieYorubas. He isoneof
tliose wliocame from tliebody ofYemaja.
Asman worships tliatfrom wliicli liehasmost to
fear, orfromwhich hehopes toreceive thegreatest
benefits, theinland tribes pay little ornoattention
toOlokun, who is,however, thechief god offisher-
menand ofallothers whose avocations takethem
upon the sea.When Oloknn isangry hecauses the
seatoberough and stirsuparaging surfupon the
shore ;and itishewhodrowns men, upsets boats or
canoes, andcauses shipwrecks.
Olokun isnotthepersonally divine seabutan
anthropomorphic conception. He isofhuman shape
andblack incolour, butwith long flowing hair,and
resides inavast palace under the sea,where heis
served byanumber ofsea-spirits, some ofwhom are
human inshape, while others partake more orlessof
thenature offish.Onordinary occasions animals
aresacrificed toOlokun, butwhen thecondition of
thesurf prevents canoes from putting toseafor

many days atatime, ahuman victim isoffered to
appease liim. Itissaid that sucIl sacrifices have
beenmade inrecent times, even atLagos, bytlie
people oftlieIsaleko quarter, wlio are cliiefly wor-
shippers ofOlokun. The sacrifice was ofcourse
secret, andaccording tonative report thecanoemen
used towatch bynight tilltheycaught some solitary
wayfarer, whom theygagged andconveyed across
thelagoon tothesea-shore, where they struck off
hisheadandthrew thebody intothesurf.
Amyth says that Olokun, becoming enraged
withmankind onaccount oftheir neglect ofhim,
endeavoured todestroy them byoverflowing the
land ;andhaddrowned largenumbers when Obatala
interfered tosave theremainder, andforced Olokun
back tohispalace, where hebound himwith seven
iron chains tillhepromised toabandon hisdesign.
This, perhaps, has reference tosome former en-
croachment oftheseaupon thelow-lying sandy
shores, which areevennow liable tobesubmerged
atspring-tides.*
Olokun hasawifenamed Olokun-su, orBlusu, who
lives intheharbour baratLagos. She iswhite in
colour andhuman inshape, but iscovered with
fish-scales from below thebreasts tothehips. The
fish inthewaters ofthebararesacred toher,and
should anyone catch them, shetakes vengeance by
upsetting canoes anddrowning theoccupants. A
manwho should besoill-advised astoattempt to

suisanexample ofalocal sea-gocldess, originally,
asontheQold Coast atthepresent day,considered
qnite independent, being attached tothegeneral god
ofthesea,andaccounted forasbelonging tohim.
(2)Olosa.
Olosa {oni-osa, owner ofthelagoon) isthegoddess
oftheLagos Lagoon, andtheprincipal wife ofher
brother Olokun, the sea-god. Like herhusband
she islong-haired. Shesprang from thebody of
Yemaja.
Olosa supplies hervotaries with fish,andthere are
several temples dedicated toheralong theshores of
thelagoon, where offerings offowls andsheep are
made tohertorender herpropitious. When the
lagoon isswollen byrainandoverflows itsbanks she
isangry, and iftheinundation beserious ahuman
victim isoffered toher, toinduce hertoreturn within
herproper limits.
Crocodiles areOlosa' smessengers, andmay not
bemolested. They aresupposed tobear tothe
goddess theofferings which thefaithful deposit on
theshores ofthelagoon orthrow intothesedge.
Some crocodiles, selected bythepriests onaccount
ofcertain marks borne bythem, aretreated with
great veneration ;andhave rude sheds, thatched
withpalm leaves, erected fortheir accommodation
near thewater's edge. Food isregularly supplied
tothese reptiles every fifth day, orfestival, and
many ofthem become sufficiently tame tocome for

shippers gathering onthebank.
(3)Shankpanna.
Shankpanna, orShakpana, who alsocamefrom the
boclj ofYemaja, istheSmall-pox god. Thename
appears tobederived from shan, todaub, smear, or
plaster, which probably hasreference tothepustules
withwhich asmall-pox patient iscovered, and alc-
pania* aman-killer, homicide. He isaccompanied
byanassistant named Buku,t who killsthose attacked
bysmall-pox bywringing their necks.
Shan-kpanna isoldandlame, and isdepicted as
limping along withtheaidofastick. According to
amyth hehasawithered leg.One day,when the
godswere allassembled atthepalace ofObatala, and
weredancing andmaking merry, Shankpanna endea-
voured tojoin inthedance, but,owing tohisdefor-
mity, stumbled and fell. Allthegodsandgoddesses
thereupon burst outlaughing, andShankpanna, in
revenge, strove toinfect them with small-pox, but
Obatala came totherescue, and, seizing hisspear,
drove Shankpanna away. From thatdayShank-
panna wasforbidden toassociate with theother g-ods,
andhebecame anoutcast whohassince lived indeso-
lateanduninhabited tracts ofcountry.
Temples dedicated toShankpanna arealways built
inthebush, atsome little distance from atown or
village, with aview tokeeping himaway from habi-

tatioiis. He ismucli dreaded, andwhen there isan
epidemic ofsmall-pox thepriests who serve him are
able toimpose almost anyterms they please upon the
terrified people, astheprice oftheir mediation. To
whistle bynight nearone of-Shankpanna's haunts^ is
believed tobeacertain way ofattracting hisnotice
andcontracting the disease. As isthecasewith
Sapatan, thesmall-pox god oftheEwe tribes, who
have perhaps adopted thenotion from theYorubas,
fliesandmosquitos arethemessengers ofShankpanna,
andhisemblem isastick covered withredandwhite
blotches, symbolic, itseems, ofthemarks hemakes
onthebodies ofhisvictims.
(4)Shigidi.
Shigidi, orShngudn, isdeified nightmare. The
name appears tomean"something short andbulky,"
andthegod, ordemon, isrepresented byabroad and
short head,made ofclay, or,more commonly, by
athick, blunted cone ofclay,which isornamented
with cowries, and isnodoubt emblematic ofthe
head...„
Shigidi isanevilgod,andenables man togratity
hishate insecret andwithout risktohimself. When
aman wishes torevenge himself upon another he
offers asacrifice toShigidi, whothereupon proceeds
atnight tothehouse oftheperson indicated and
killshim. Hismode ofprocedure istosquat upon
thebreast ofhisvictim and"press outhisbreath;"
but itoften happens that thetutelary deity ofthe
sufferer conies totherescue andwakes liim,upon


MINOR GODS. 75
which. Shigidi leaps off,fallsupon theearthen floor,
anddisappears, forheonlyhaspower overman dur-
ingsleep. This superstition still lingers among the
negroes oftheBahamas ofYoruba descent, who talk
ofbeing "hagged," and believe thatnightmare is
caused byademon thatcrouches upon thebreast of
thesleeper. Theword nightmare isitself asurvival
from asimilar belief once heldbyourselves, mare
being theAnglo-Saxon msere, elforgoblin.
Theperson whoemploys Shigidi, andsends him
outtokill,must remain awake tillthegodreturns,
for ifhewere tofallasleep Shigidi would atthat
moment turn back, and themission would fail.
Shigidi either travels onthewind, orraises awind
towafthimalong;onthispoint opinions differ. The
firstsymptom ofbeing attacked byShigidi, isafeeling
ofheatandoppression atthepitofthestomach, "like
hot,boiled rice," saidanative. Ifamanexperiences
thiswhen heisfalling asleep, itbehoves himtogetup
atonceandseektheprotection ofthegodheusually
serves.
Houses andenclosed yards canbeplaced under the
guardianship ofShigidi. Inorder todothisahole is
dugintheearth, andafowl, sheep, or,inexceptional
cases, ahuman victim isslaughtered, sothat the
blood drains intothehole,and isthen buried. Ashort,
conical mound ofredearth isnext built over thespot,
and anearthen saucer jolaced onthesummit to
receive occasional sacrifices. When asitehasthus
been placed under theprotection ofShigidi, hekills,mhistypical manner, thosewhoinjure thebuildings,
orwhotrespass there withbadintentions.

(5)Olarosa.
Olarosa (?Alarense, helper) istlietutelary deity of
Houses. He isrepresented asarmed with astick or
sword, and hisimage isfound inalmost every house-
hold guarding theentrance. His office istodrive
away sorcerers and evil spirits, andtokeep Elegba
from entering thehouse.
(6)Dada.
Dada, more properly Eda, orIda, isthegod of
New-born Babes andYegetables. Thename appears
tomean natural production, anything produced or
brought forth bynatural process. Dada isrepre-
sented byacalabash ornamented with cowries, on
which isplaced aball ofindigo. He isone ofthose
whocamefrom thebody ofYemaja.
(7)Ota.
Oya isthegoddess oftheNiger, which iscalled
OdoOya,theriver ofOya. She isthechief wife of
thethunder-god, Shango, and, ashasalready been
said,hermessenger isAfefe, theWind. AtLokoro,
nearPorto Novo, there issaid tobeatemple ofOya
containing animage ofthegoddess with eight heads
surrounding acentral head. This issupposed tobe
symboHcal ofthenumerous outfalls oftheNiger
through itsdelta. Oyaandthetwofollowing sprang
fromYemaja.
(8)OSHUN.
Oshun, goddess oftheriver ofthesame name,

wife ofSliango. Crocodiles wliicli bear certain marks
aresacred toher,andareconsidered hermessengers.
Human sacrifices aremade toOshun intime ofneed.
(9)Oba.
Oba, thethird wife ofShango, isthegoddess ofthe
Eiver Ibu, orOba.
(10)AjeShaltjga.
AjeShaluga isthegod of"Wealth, andconfers
riches onhisworshippers. Thename appears to
mean either "the gainer whomakes torecur," or
"thesorcerer whomakes torecur." (Aje, sorcerer;
aje,earner, orgainer, and shahi, torecur.) His
emblem isalarge cowry. Oneproverb says,"Aje
Shaluga often passes bythefirstcaravan asitcomes
tothemarket, andloads thelastwith benefits ;"and
another, "Hewho while walking finds acowry is
favoured byAjeShaluga." The large cowry, emble-
matic ofAjeShaluga, hasnovalue asamedium of
exchange, thesmall white cowries being alone used
forthat purpose. He isthepatron ofdyesandof
colours generally. Hecame from thebody of
Yemaja.
(11)Oeisha Oko.
Orisha Oko {oJco, farm, garden, plantation) isthe
god ofAgriculture, and isoneofthose Avhosprang
from thebody ofYemaja. Asthenatives chiefiy
depend upon thefruits oftheearth fortheir food,


78 THEYOnUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Orislia Oko ismucli lionourecl. There isscarcely a
town orvillage that hasnotatemple dedicated to
him,andhehasalargenumber ofpriests andpriest-
esses inhisservice.
Although his first care istopromote thefertility
oftheearth, heisalso thegod ofnatural fertility
ingeneral, forheisaphallic divinity, andhisimage
isalways provided with anenormous ])haTlus. He
thusresembles Priapus, who, although aphallic deity,
was, apparently, primarily agarden-god, whofostered
andprotected crops. (Catullus, xix.xx.; Tibullus, i.i.)
Anemblem ofOrisha Oko isanironrod,andhoney
bees arehismessengers. Itisprobably with refer-
ence tohisphallic attributes thathehasthe title of
Eni-chLru—"theerect personage." One ofhisfunc-
tions istocure malarial fevers, towhich thosewho
disturb thesoilintheprocess ofcultivation arepar-
ticularly liable.
There isanannual festival toOrisha Oko, held
when theyam crop isripe,and allthen partake of
newyams. Atthis festival general licence prevails,
thepriestesses givethemselves indiscriminately toall
themale worshippers ofthegod,and, theoretically,
every man hasaright tosexual intercourse with
everywoman hemaymeet abroad. Social prejudices
have, however, restricted theapplication ofthis pri-
vilege, and itisnowonly slave-girls, orwomen ofthe
lowest order, who arereally atthedisposal ofthe
public, andthen only ifthey areconsenting parties.
Atthisfestival allkinds ofvegetable productions are
cooked andplaced invessels inthestreets, forgeneral
use.

(13)Aeoni.
Aroni istheForest-god, and, likethe last, hasa
knowledge ofmedicine, though thecure ofdisease is
not hisspecial function. Thename means "One
having awithered limb," andAroni isalways repre-
sented asofhuman shape butwith onlyoneleg,the
head ofadog,andadog's tail.
Aroni seizes anddevours thosewhomeethimin

him ;but ifaman faceshimboldly andshows nosign
offear,heleads him tohisdwelling inthefastnesses
ofthe forest, andkeeps himthere fortwoorthree
months, during which timeheteaches himthesecrets
oftheplants and their medicinal properties. When
thepupil hasnomore tolearn Aroni dismisses him,
giving himahairfrom his tailtoprove totheincre-
dulous thathehasreally been initiated.
Aneddy ofwind, rushing through theforest and
swirling upthedead leaves, isconsidered amani-
festation ofAroni.

(16) Ibeji.
Ibeji, Twins {U,tobeget, eji,two) isthetutelary
deity oftwins, andanswers tothegodHoho ofthe

(17)OSHUMAEE.
Oshumare istheRainbow-god, theGreat Snake of
theUnderneath, whocomes upattimes above the
edge oftheearth todrink water from thesky. The
name iscompounded ofshu, togather indark clouds,
tobecome gloomy, andtheword mare, ormaye, which
occurs inoneoftheepithets ofOlorun, andthemean-
ingofwhich isuncertain. Thisgod isalsocommon
totheEwe-tribes, under thename ofAnyiewo, and
hasbeen described in"TheEwe-Speaking People of
theSlave Coast of"West Africa." Avariety ofthe

Okeandasign thatsomething isrequired. The
emblem ofOke isastone orfragment ofrock. He

AtAbeokuta there isarocky cavern inwhich Oke
isworshipped. Itispopularly believed bytheother
tribes thattheEgbas, when defeated inwar,canretire
into thiscavern, which then hermetically seals itself
tillthedanger ispast.

Oshosi, who isalsoone ofthosewhocame from
Yemaja, isthepatron ofHunters. Heresides inthe
forest, anddrives thegame into thesnares and pit-
falls ofhisfaithful followers, whom healso protects
from beasts ofprey. He isrepresented asaman
armed with abow, orfrequently byabow alone.
Offerings aremade tohim ofthefruits ofthechase,
chiefly ofantelopes,

According tothemyth, thesun,moon, and stars
camefrom thebody ofYemaja. Orun, theSun,and
Oshu, theMoon, aregods, butthestars donotseem
tohave been deified. Theworship ofthesunand
moon is,moreover, nowvery nearly obsolete, and
sacrifices arenolonger offered tothem, though the
appearance ofthenewmoon iscommonly celebrated
byafestival.
The stars arethedaughters ofthesunandmoon.
The boys, oryoung suns, ongrowing uptried to

follow their father inhiscourse across thesky to
where theseaandtheskymeet, andwhich, saythe
Yorubas, istheplacewhere thewhitemengoandfind
allthethings withwhich they filltheir ships;buthe,
jealous ofhispower, turned uponthemandtried to
killthem. Some ofthem sought refuge with Olosa,
some with Olokun, and theremainder with their
grandmother, Yemaja, who turned them into fish.
Thus allthesonswere driven outofthesky,butthe
daughters remained with theirmother and stillaccom-
pany herbynight. Thismyth isvirtually thesame
asthat current among theeastern Ewe-tribes, who
have almost certainly learnt itfrom their Yoruba
neighbours.
Toseethenewmoon islucky, and, just asinEng-
land, people wishwhen they first see it.Asamongst
theEwe-tribes, aneclipse oftheMoon issupposed to
indicate that theSun isbeating her,and steps are
taken todrivehimaway, similar tothose described in
"TheEwe-Speaking People."
TheYorubas paysome attention totheheavenly
bodies. Theplanet Venus, when near theMoon, is
called Aja-Oshu, theMoon's Dog, because shetravels
with it.When amorning starshe iscalled Ofere, or
Ofe,which seems tomean apaleblue colour. When
anevening starshe iscalled Irawo-ale, Star ofthe
Evening. Sirius iscalled Irawo-oko, Canoe Star,
because itisbeheved tobeaguide tocanoemen. A
proverbial saying likens the stars tochickens fol-
lowing ahen,theMoon ;andtheMilkyWay iscalled
"thegroup ofchickens."

(23) Olori-meein.
Olori-meriu, possessor offour lieacls, isauotlier god
whose worship isnearly, i£not quite, obsolete. He
wasthetutelary deity oftowns, andwasrepresented
byahillock, or,ifnohillock existed within thepre-
cincts ofthetown, byanartificial mound.
Sacrifice wasmade toOlori-merin every three
months, orfourtimes ayear,andalways consisted of
anew-born child notmore than three orfour days'
old.The child's throat was cutbyapriest, andthe
blood, caught inacalabash orearthen vessel, was
placed onthesummit ofthemound, afterwhich the
fleshwas sliced upinto small pieces andburied in
themound. During thisdreadful scene themother
hadtobepresent. This sacrifice was called Bjodun
(Eje-odun),"Theseason ofblood."
Olori-merin had, ashisname betokens, four heads,
withwhich hewatched thefour points ofthecompass
from thetopofhismound, and itwasbelieved that
nowar orpestilence could attack atown under his
protection. Hehadthelegsand feet ofagoat.
Sometimes, atnight, heappeared intheshape ofa
venomous serpent.
