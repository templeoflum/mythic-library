CHAPTER II.
Chief Gods.
Thetendency wliicli wenoted inthecase oftheEwe-
speaking peoples toreplace godswhich were purely
local, andonlyworshipped bythose dwelling inthe
vicinity, bytribal gods, andbygodsworshipped byan
entire people, hasinthecase oftheYoruba tribes
beenvery fully developed, and allthegods possessing
anyimportance areknown toandworshipped bythe
Yoruba-speaking peoples asawhole. The effect of
increasing thenumber ofgeneral objects ofworship
hasbeen todiminish theimportance ofthelocal
objects ofworship, thegenii loci,who, except inJebu
andinsome oftheremoter districts, have been so
shorn oftheir power asnow tobescarcely above
thelevel ofthe fairies andwater- sprites ofmedieval
England, or,which isperhaps acloser parallel, ofthe
Naiads andHama-dryads ofancient Grreece. This
ofcourse iswhatwas tobeexpected, forthegeneral
objects ofworship govern, between them, allthe
phenomena which most nearly affect mankind; and
thespecial function ofeach genius loci isthusnow
vested insome other god,who isbelieved tobemore
powerful, because he isworshipped over alarger
areaandhasamore numerous following. Grods,


CHIEF GODS. 35
however, which arepurely tutelar have notbeen so
much affected, andtutelary dieties oftowns and of
individuals are stillcommon; because the native,
while enrolling himself asafollower ofageneral god,
likes also tohave aprotector whose solebusiness isto
guard hisinterests ;andwho,though hispowermay
belimited, isnotlikely tobedistracted bytheclaims
ofothers tohisattention.
Theterm usedbytheYoruba tribes toexpress a
superhuman being, orgod, isorisha, and as itis
used equally toexpress theimages andsacred objects,
and also asanadjective with themeaning ofsacred
orholy, itanswers exactly totheTshiterm holisum, the
Galoong, andtheEwe vodu. Theword orisha seems
tobecompounded ofori(summit, top,head) andsha
(toselect, choose);though some natives prefer to
derive itfrom ri(tosee)and islia (selection, choice),
andthus tomake itmean "Onewho seesthecult."
(1)Oloeun.
Olorun isthesky-god oftheYorubas, that is,heis
thedeified firmament, orpersonal sky,just asNyan-
kupon istotheTshis,Nyonmo totheGas,andMaAvu
totheEwes. Aswasmentioned inthelastvolume,
thegeneral bias ofthenegro mind hasbeen infavour
ofselecting thefirmament forthe chief Nature-
god,instead oftheSun,Moon, orEarth ;andinthis
respect the natives resemble theAryan Hindus,
Greeks, andRomans, withwhom Dyaus pitar, Zeus,
and Jupiter equally represented thefirmament.*
*Tlio Tsliis andGas usethewords Nyankupon andJSTyonmo to
express sky, rain, ortlinnder and lightning, and tlie ICVves and

Nyaiikupoii andNyonmo tlauncler and ligliten as
well aspour out rain, butOlorun, like theEwe
Mawu, does notwield tliethunderbolt, wlncli lias
become thefunction ofaspecial thunder-god, and
heconsequently has suffered some reduction m
importance. Thename Olorun means "Owner of
theSky"{pni,onewhopossesses, orun, sky,firmament,
cloud*), andthesky isbelieved tobeasolid body,
curving over theearth soastocover itwith a
vaulted roof.
LikeNyankupon, Nyonmo, andMawu, Olorun is
considered toodistant, ortooindifferent, tointerfere
intheaffairs oftheworld. The natives saythathe
enjoys alife ofcomplete idleness and repose, a
blissful condition according totheir ideas, andpasses
histimedozing orsleeping. Since heistoolazy or
tooindifferent toexercise anycontrol over earthly
affairs, man onhis side does notwaste timem
endeavouring topropitiate him, butreserves his
worship and sacrifice formore active agents. Hence
Olorun hasnopriests, symbols, images, ortemples,
Yorubas, thewordsMawu andOlorun toexpress thetwoformer.
TheTshi peoples sayNyanlupon bom(Nyankupou knocks);"Itis
thundering"; Nyanlcnpon aha(Nyankupou hascome), "Itisram-
ino-"•andtheGapeoples, Nyonmo kn.;cks (thunders), Nyonmo
po'lirs, Nyonmo drizzles, &c,while injustthesamewaytheAncient
Greeks ascribed thesephenomena toZens,whosnowed, rained, hailed,
gathered clouds, andthundered. Nyankupon has forepithets the
following: Amosu (Giver ofRain); Amovua (Giver ofSunshine);
Teterehoensu (Widc-speading Creator ofWater), andTyoduampon,
.yhich seems tomean"Stretched-out Roof" {Tyo, todraw ordrag,
dua,wood, andpon, flatsurface).

CHIEF GODS. 37
and tliougli, intimes ofcalamity oraffliction, wlien
theother godshave turned adeafeartohissupplica-
tions, anative will,perhaps, asalastresource, invoke
Olorun, such occasions are rare, and asageneral
rulethegod isnotworshipped orappealed to.The
name Olorun, however, occurs inone ortwo set
phrases orsentences, which appear toshow that at
onetime greater regard was paid tohim. Tor
instance, theproper reply tothemorning salutation,
"Have yourisen well ?"is0yinOlorim, "Thanks
toOlorun ;"andthephrase "May Olorun protect
you"issometimes heard asanevening salutation.
Theformer seems tomean thatthanks areduetothe
skyforletting thesunenter it ;andthelatter tobe
aninvocation ofthefirmament, theroof oftheworld,
toremain above andprotect theearth during the
night. Sometimes natives willraise their hands and
cry,"Olorun, Olorun !"just aswesay,"Heaven
forbid! "andwithanequal absence ofliteral meaning.
Olorun hasthefollowing epithets:—
(1)Oga-ogo {Oga, distinguished orbrave person;
ogo,wonder, praise).
(2)Oloivo (ni-oivo) "Venerable one."
(3)Electa {da, tocease from raining), "Hewho
controls therain."
(4)Elemi, "aliving man," literally "hewho
possesses breath." Itisatitle apj^lied toaservant
orslave, because hismaster's breath isathismercy;
and itisinthissense alsothat itisused toOlorun,
because, ifhewere evilly disposed, hecould letfall
thesolidfirmament andcrush theworld.
(5)Olodumaye orOlodumare. The derivation of


38 THEYOllUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
this epithet isobscure, but itprobably means
"Replenisher ofbrooks" {Olodo, possessing brooks).
We find thesame termination inOshumaye or
Oshumare, Eainbow, and inOsamaye orOsamare,
Water Lily, and itisperhaps compomided ofomi,
water, and aye,astate ofbeing alive.
Itmaybementioned that, just asthemissionaries
haye caused Nyankupon, Nyonmo, andMawu tobe
confused with theJehovah ofthe Christians, by
translating thesenames as"God," sohavethey done
with Olorun, whom they consider tobeasurvival
from aprimitive revelation, made toallmankind, in
thechildhood oftheworld. ButOlorun ismerely a
nature-god, thepersonally divine sky,andheonly
controls phenomena connected inthenative mind with
theroof oftheworld. He isnotinanysense an
omnipotent being. This iswell exemplified bythe
proverb which says,"Aman cannot causeram to
fall,andOlorun cannot giveyouachild," which
means that, justasamancannot perform thefunctions
ofOlorun andcause rain tofall, soOlorun cannot
form achild inthewomb, thatbeing thefunction of
thegodObatala, whom weshall next describe. In
fact,each god,Olorun included, has, asitwere, his
own duties ;andwhile heisperfectly independent in
hisowndomain, hecannot trespass upon therights of
others.
(2)Obatala.
Obatala isthechiefgodoftheYorubas. Thename
means"Lord oftheWhite Cloth"{Oha-ti-ala),and
isexplained bythefactthatwhite isthecolour sacred


CHIEF GODS. 39
toObatala, whose temples, images, andparapliernalia
arealways painted wliite, andwhose followers wear
white cloths. Another derivation isOha-ti-ala, "Lord
ofVisions, "and this gains some probability from
the fact that Obatala has theepithets ofOrisha
ofenia,"TheOrisha who enters man," andAlahalese
{Al-ha-ni-ase) "Hewho predicts the fntnre,"
beca.use heinspires theoracles andpriests, andunveils
futurity bymeans ofvisions. "Lord oftheWhite
Cloth," however, isthetranslation most commonly
adopted, andappears tobethecorrect one. Thegod
isalways represented aswearing awhite cloth.
Obatala, saythe priests, wasmadebyOlorun, who
then handed over tohim themanagement ofthe
firmament andtheworld, andhimself retired torest.
Obatala isthus also asky-god, but isamore anthro-
pomorphic conception than Olorun, andperforms
functions which arenotintheleast connected with
thefirmament. According toamyth, which is,how-
ever, contradicted byanother, Obatala made thefirst
manandwoman outofclay,onwhich account hehas
thetitle ofAlamorere, "Owner ofthebestclay;"and
because hekneaded theclay himself he iscalled
Orisha JqjoJcpo, "TheOrisha whokneads clay"{hpo,
totnead ortemper clay). Though this point is
disputed bysome natives, allareagreed thatObatala
forms the child inthemother's womb, andwomen
who desire tobecome mothers address their prayers
tohim ;while albinoism andcongenital deformities
areregarded ashishandiwork, done either topunish

some neglect towards liimontliepart oftlieparents,
ortoremind hisworshippers ofhispower.
Obatala isalso styled "Protector oftheTown
G-ates," andinthiscapacity isrepresented asmounted
onahorse, andarmed with aspear. Onthepanels
ofthetemple doors rude carvings arefrequently seen
ofahorseman with aspear, surrounded byaleopard,
tortoise, fish,andserpent. Another epithet ofObatala
isOhatala gbinghinihi,"Theenormous Obatala." His
special offerings areedible snails.
Amongst theEwe-speaking Peoples atPorto Novo,
Obatala determines theguilt orinnocence ofaccused
persons bymeans ofanoracle termed Onshe or
Onislie (messenger, ambassador). Itconsists ofa
hollow cylinder ofwood, about 3^feetinlength and
2feet indiameter, oneendofwhich iscovered with
draperies and theother closed with shells ofthe
edible snail. This cylinder isplaced onthehead of
theaccused, who kneels ontheground, holding it
firmly onhishead with ahand ateach side. The
god, being then invoked bythe priests, causes the
cylinder torockbackwards andforwards, andfinally
tofalltotheground. Ifitshould fallforward the
accused isinnocent, ifbackward guilty. The priests
saythat Obatala, orasubordinate spirit towhom
hedeputes theduty, strikes theaccused, soasto
make thecylinder fallintherequired direction ;but
sceptics and native Christians saythat achild is
concealed inthecylinder andoverbalances itinfront
orbehind, according toinstructions given before-
hand bythe priests. They addthatwhen achild
hasserved forayear ortwoandgrown toobigfor


CHIEF GODS. 41
tliecylinder lie isput todeath, inorder tliat the
secretmaybopreserved; and issucceeded byanother,
who, inhisturn, undergoes thesame fate—but all
this ismere conjecture.
(3)Odudua.
Odudua, orOdua, whohasthe title ofTyaagbe,
"Themother who receives," isthechief goddess of
theYorubas. Thename means "Black One" (clu,
tobeblack;dudu, black), andthenegroes consider
asmooth, glossy, black skin agreat beauty, andfar
superior tooneoftheordinary cigar-colour. She is
always represented asawoman sitting down, and
nursing achild.
Odudua isthewife ofObatala, butshewascoeval
with Olorun, andnotmade byhim, aswasherhus-
band. Other natives, however, saythat shecame
from Ife,theholy city, incommon withmost ofthe
other gods, asdescribed inamyth which weshall
come toshortly. Odudua represents theearth, mar-
ried totheanthropomorphic sky-god. Obatala and
Odudua, orHeaven andEarth, resemble, saythe
priests, two large cut-calabashes, which, when once
shut, cannever beopened. This issymbolised in
thetemples bytwowhitened saucer-shaped calabashes,
placed onecovering theother ;theupper oneofwhich
represents theconcave firmament stretching overand
meeting theearth, thelower one, atthehorizon.
According tosome priests, Obatala andOdudua
represent oneandrogynous divinity; andtheysaythat
animage which issufficiently common, ofahuman

being witlionearmand leg,andatailterminating in
aspliere, symbolises tliis. This notion, however, is
notonecommonly lield, Obutala andOdudua being
generally, andalmost universally, regarded astwo
distinct persons. The phallus andyoni injuxta-
position areoften seen carved onthedoors ofthe
temples both ofObatala andOdudua ;butthis does
notseem tohave anyreference toandrogyny, since
they arealsofound similarly depicted inother places
which areinnowayconnected with either ofthese
deities.
According toamyth Odudua isblind. Inthe
beginning oftheworld sheandherhusband Obatala
were shutupindarkness inalarge, closed calabash,
Obatala being intheupper partandOdudua inthe
lower. Themyth doesnotstatehowtheycame tobe
inthis situation, buttheyremained there formany
days, cramped, hungry, anduncomfortable. Then
Odudua began complaining, blaming herhusband for
theconfinement ;andaviolent quarrel ensued, inthe
course ofwhich, inafrenzy ofrage, Obatala toreout
her eyes, because shewould notbridle hertongue.
Inreturn shecursed him,saying "Naught shalt thou
eatbut snails," which isthereason why snails are
now offered toObatala. Asthemyth doesnotmake
Odudua recover her sight, shemust besupposed to
haveremained sightless, butnonative regards heras
being blind.
Odudua ispatroness oflove,andmany stories are
told ofheradventures andamours. Her chief temple
isinAdo, theprincipal town ofthestate ofthesame
name, situated about fifteen miles tothenorth of


CHIEF cons. 43
BadagTj. Theword Adomeans alewd person of
eitlier sex,and itsselection forthename ofthistown
isaccounted forbythefollowing legend. Odiidua
wasoncewalking alone intheforest when shemeta
hunter, whowassohandsome thattheardent tempera-
ment ofthegoddess atoncetook fire. Theadvances
which shemade tohimwere favourably received, and
theyforthwith mutually gratified their passion onthe
spot. After this, thegoddess became stillmore
enamoured, and,unable totearherself away from her
lover, shelived withhim forsomeweeks inahut,
which they constructed ofbranches atthefoot ofa
large silk-cotton tree. Attheend ofthistime her
passion hadburnt out,andhaving become weary of
thehunter, she lefthim ;butbefore doing soshe
promised toprotect him and allothers who
might comeanddwell inthefavoured spotwhere she
hadpassed somany pleasant hours. Inconsequence
many people came and settled there, andatown
gradually grew up,which wasnamed Ado, tocom-
memorate thecircumstances ofitsorigin. Atemple
was built fortheprotecting goddess )and there, on
herfeast days, sacrifices ofcattle andsheep aremade,
andwomen abandon themselves indiscriminately to
themaleworshippers inherhonour.
(4)Aganju andYemaja.
Before heramour with thehunter, Odudua bore to
herhusband, Obatala, aboyandagirl,named respect-
ivelyAganju andYemaja. ThenameAganju means
uninhabited tract ofcountry, wilderness, plain, or


44 THEYOnUBA-SPEAKTKG rEOPLE^.
forest, andYemaja, "Mother offish" {ijeye, mother;
eja, fish). Theoffspring oftheunion ofHeaven and
Earth, that is,ofObatala andOdudua, maythusbe
said torepresent Land andWater. Yemaja isthe
goddess ofbrooks and streams, and presides over
ordeals bywater. She isrepresented byafemale
figure, yellow incolour, wearing blue beads anda
white cloth. Theworship ofAganju seems tohave
fallen into disuse, ortohavebecome merged inthat
ofhismother ;butthere issaid tobeanopen space
infront oftheking's residence inOyowhere thegod
wasformerly worshipped, which isstill called 0]u-
Aganju—"Front ofAganju."
Yemaja married herbrother Aganju, andbore ason
named Orungan. Thisname iscompounded oforun,
sky,andgan,from ga,tobehigh; andappears to
mean"Intheheight ofthesky." Itseems toanswer
tothe Ichelcheme, or"Free-air Region" oftheEwe
peoples ;and, like it,tomean theapparent space be-
tween theskyandtheearth. The offspring ofLand
andWater would thusbewhatwecallAir.
Orungan fellinlovewith hismother, and asshe
refused tolisten tohisguilty passion, heonedaytook
advantage ofhisfather's absence, andravished her.
Immediately after the act,Yemaja sprang toherfeet
and fledfrom theplace wringing herhands and
lamenting; andwaspursued byOrungan, who strove
toconsole herbysaying thatnooneshould know of
what had occurred, anddeclared thathecould not
livewithout her.Heheld outtoherthealluring
prospect ofliving withtwohusbands, oneacknow-
ledged, andtheother insecret ;butsherejected all


CHIEF GODS. 45
liisproposals with loathing, andcontinued torun
awa3^ Orungan, however, rapidly gained upon her,
andwas just stretching out hishand toseize her,
when she fellbackward totheground. Then her
bodyimmediately began toswell inafearful manner,
twostreams ofwater gushed from herbreasts, and
herabdomen burst open. Thestreams from Yemaja's
breasts joined andformed alagoon, andfrom her
gaping bodycame thefollowing:—(1)Dada (god of
vegetables), (2)Shango (god oflightning), (3)Ogun
(god ofironandwar), (4)Olokun (god ofthe sea),
(5)Olosa (goddess ofthelagoon), (6)Oya (god-
dess oftheriver Niger), (7)Oshun (goddess ofthe
river Oshun), (8)Oba (goddess oftheriver Oba),
(9)Orisha Oko (god ofagriculture), (10)Oshosi
(god ofhunters), (11)Oke(god ofmountains), (12)
AjeShaluga (god ofwealth), (13)Shankpanna (god of
small-pox), (14.)Orun (the sun),and(15)Oshu (the
moon).* Tocommemorate this event, atownwhich
wasgiven thename ofIfe(distention, enlargement, or
swelling up),was built onthespotwhere Yemaja's
body burst open, andbecame theholy city ofthe
Yoruba-speaking tribes. The place where herbody
fellused tobeshown, andprobably still is ;butthe
townwasdestroyed in1882, inthewarbetween the
IfesontheonehandandtheIbadans andModakekes
ontheother.
Themyth ofYemaja thusaccounts fortheorigin of
several ofthegods,bymaking them thegrandchildren
ofObatala andOdudua ;butthere areother gods,who
*The order, according tosome, wasOlokun, Olosa, Shango,
Oya,Oshun, Oba,Ogun, Dada, andtheremainder asabove.


46 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
donotbelong tothisfamily group, andwhose genesis
isnotaccounted forinanyway. Two, atleast, of
theprincipal gods areinthiscategory, andwethere-
fore leave forthemoment theminor deities who
sprung fromYemaja, andproceed with thechief gods,
irrespective oftheir origin.
(5)Shango.
Shango, thegodofthunder andlightning, is,next
toObatala, themost powerful godoftheYorubas;he
wasthesecond tospring from thebody ofYemaja.
Hisname appears tobederived from shan, "to
strike violently," and go,"tobewilder ;"andtohave
reference topeals ofthunder, which aresupposed to
beproduced byviolent blows.* Hehastheepithet
ofJakuta, "Hurler ofstones," or"Fighter with
stones"(Ja,tohurlfrom aloft, orjci,tofight, and
olcuta, stone) ;andstone implements, which have long
ceased tobeused in"West Africa, arebelieved tobe
histhunderbolts.
Towield thethunderbolt iscertainly one ofthe
proper functions ofthesky-god, andtheprocess by
which hebecomes deprived ofitisnotbyanymeans
clear. Itdoesnotappear tobetheresult ofadvanc-
ingculture, fortheZeus oftheGreeks andtheJupiter
oftheRomans, whohad respectively theepithets
Kerauneios andTonans, retained it ;asdotheNyan-
kupon oftheTshis and theNyomno oftheGas;
while, liketheEwes andYorubas, theAryan Hindus
*For thesame notion among theTshis andGas, seeNote at
p.36.

made anotlier god,namely, Indva, offspring ofDyaus,
wield thelightning.
Thenotion wefound amongst theEwes that abird-
likecreature wastheanimating entity ofthethunder-
storm hasnoparallel here, andShango ispurely
anthropomorphic. Hedwells intheclouds inan
immense brazen palace, where hemaintains alarge
retinue andkeeps agreat number ofhorses;for,
besides being thethunder-god, heisalso thegod of
thechase andofpillage.* From hispalace, Shango
hurls upon those whohave offended him red-hot
chains ofiron, which areforged forhimbyhis
brother Ogun, god oftheriverOgun, ofironand of
war ;butthis, itshould beobserved, isseemingly a
modern notion, andthered-hot chains furnished by
Ogun have asuspicious resemblance tothethunder-
bolts ofJupiter, forged byYulcan. TheYoruba
word forlightning ismana-mana (ma-ina, amaking
offire), andhasnoconnection either with iron (irin)
orachain (eivon) ;while thename Jakuta shows that
Shango isbelieved tohurl stones andnotiron. The
iron-chain notion, therefore, appears tohave been
borrowed from some foreign source, and,moreover,
not toyethavemade much progress. The Oni-
Shango, orPriests ofShango, fintheir chants always
speak ofShango ashurling stones ;andwhenever a
house isstruck bylightning they rush inabody to
pillage itand tofindthestone, which, astheytake

itwith tliem secretly, tliey always succeed indoing.
Acliant oftheOni-Shango verycommonly heard is,
"Oh,Shango, thou artthemaster. Thou takestm
thyhand thy fiery stones, topunish theguilty and
satisfy thine anger. Everything thatthey strike is
destroyed. Their fireeatsupthe forest, thetrees
arebroken down, and allliving creatures areslam;
andthelay-worshippers ofShango flock into the
streets during athunderstorm crying, "Shango,
Shango, areatKing !Shango isthelordandmaster.
Inthestorm hehurls hisfiery stones against his
enemies, andtheir track gleams inthemidst ofthe
darkness." "May Shango's stone strike you," isa
verycommon imprecation.
According tosome natives, Oshumare, theEainbow,
istheservant ofShango, his office being totakeup
water from theearth tothepalace intheclouds. He
hasamessenger named Ara,"Thunder-clap," whom
hesends outwith aloud noise.Asmall bird called
;papagori issacred toShango, and hisworshippers
profess tobeable tounderstand itscry.
Shango married three ofhissisters :Oya,theNiger;
Oshun, theriver ofthesame name, which rises in
Ijesa Indflows into thewater-way between Lagos
andtheLekki lagoon, nearEmina; andOba, alsoa
river, which rises inIbadan andflows intotheKradu
Water. Allthreeaccompany theirhusband when he
goes out,Oyataking with herhermessenger Afefe
(theWind, orGale ofWind), andOshun andOba
carrying hisbowandsword. Shango's slaveBin

insize, ofliisthree wives ;whoarealsorepresented as

and, onimportant occasions, human beings. His
colours areredand white. He isconsulted with
sixteen cowries, which arethrown ontheground,
thosewhich liewith thebackuppermost being favour-
able,andthose with thebackdownward thereverse.
Heusually goesarmed with aclub called oshe,made
ofthewood oftheayan tree,which issohard that a
proverb says, "Theayan tree resists theaxe." In
consequence ofhisclubbeingmade ofthiswood, the
tree issacred tohim.
The priests andfollowers ofShango wear awallet,
emblematic oftheplundering propensities oftheir
lord, andthechief priest iscalled Magba, "The
Receiver." Asamongst theEwe tribes, ahouse
struck bylightning isatonceinvaded andplundered
bythedisciples ofthegod,andafineimposed onthe
occupants, who, itisheld,must have offended him.
Persons who arekilled bylightning may not, pro-
perly speaking, beburied ;but iftherelations ofthe
deceased offer asufficient payment, thepriests usually
allow thecorpse toberedeemed andburied. Indi-
viduals rendered insensible bylightning areatonce
despatched bythepriests, theaccident being regarded
asproof positive thatShango requires them.A

Theforegoing are,with theexception ofthemyth
ofthefiery chains, theoldideas respecting Shango;
butontothem arenow rapidly becoming grafted
some later myths, which make Shango anearthly
kingwho afterwards became agod. This Shango
.
wasKing ofOyo, capital ofYoruba, andbecame so
unbearable through rapacity, cruelty, andtyranny,
thatthechiefs andpeople atlastsenthimacalabash
ofparrots' eggs, inaccordance with thecustom that
hasalready beenmentioned ;with amessage thathe
must befatigued with thecares ofgovernment, and
that itwastime forhimtogotosleep. Onreceiving
thisintimation, Shango, instead ofallowing himself to
bequietly strangled byhiswives, defied public opinion
andendeavoured toassemble hisadherents ;and,when
this failed, sought safety inflight. He left the
palace bynight, intending toendeavour toreach
Tapa, beyond theNiger, which was hismother's
native place ;andwasaccompanied onlybyonewife
andone slave, the rest ofhishousehold having
deserted him. During thenight thewiferepented of
herhasty action, andalso lefthim; so,when inthe
morning Shango found himself lostinthemidst ofa
pathless forest, hehadnoonewithhimbuthisslave.
They wandered about without food forsome days,
seeking invain forapathwhich would leadthem out
oftheforest, andatlastShango lefthisslave, saying,
"Wait here tillIreturn, andwewillthen tryfurther."
After waiting along time, theslave, ashismaster did
notappear, went insearch ofhim,andbefore long


I CHIEF GODS. 51
found Liscorpse hanging bjtheneckfromanayan-
tree. Eventually theslave succeeded inextricating
hunself from theforest, andfinding himself inapart
ofthecountry heknew, made hiswaytowards Oyo,
where hetoldthenews.
When thechiefs andelders heard thatShango had
hanged himself theyweremuch alarmed, fearing that
theywould beheld responsible forhisdeath. They
went, incompany with thepriests, totheplacewhere
theslave had leftthebody, butwere unable tofind
it,for itwasnolonger onthe tree. They searched
inevery direction, andatlastfound adeep pitinthe
earth, fromwhich theendofanironchain protruded.
They stooped over the pitand listened, andcould
hearShango talking down intheearth. They at
once erected asmall temple over the pit,andleaving
some priests there topropitiate thenew god,and
establish aworship, returned toOyo,where they pro-
claimed:"Shango isnotdead. Hehasbecome an
orislia. Hehasdescended into theearth, and lives
among thedead people, withwhomwehaveheardhim
conversing." Some ofthetownspeople, however,
being ignorant andfoolish, didnotbelieve thestory,
andwhen the criers cried, "Shango isnot dead,''
they laughed andshouted inreturn, "Shango is
dead. Shango hanged himself." Inconsequence
ofthiswicked conduct, Shango came inperson,
•with aterrific thunderstorm, topunish them for

Shango hasbecome anorislm. Seewhat these baa
menhavebrought uponyoubytheir unbelief. He is
angry because theylaughed athim,andhehasburned

the scoffers andbeatthem todeath, sothatShango
wasappeased, andhisanger turned away, ihepace
where Shango descended intotheearth was called
Kuso, andsoonbecame atown, formany people went
todwell there.
Perhaps thismyth really does refer tosome former
King ofOyo,though whysuch aking should usurp
thefunctions ofthethunder-god, isnotatallclear.
Itisinconsistent inpart, for itmakes thechiefs and
elders alarmed atthesuicide ofShango, because they
feared tobeheld responsible forhisdeath;yetthey
would havebeen equally responsible hadhecomplied
withestabhshed custom, andcommitted suicide when
hereceived theparrots' eggsthey senthim. Theta€t
oftheayanbeing sacred tothegodShango, nodoubt
caused thattreetobeselected forthelegendary suicide
oftheking Shango; andtheironchain which pro-
truded from thehole intheground wasprobably
suggested bythenotion ofred-hot chains oflightning.
Aswehave said, thismyth israpidly becoming blended
with theolder ones, and, inconsequence ofthese events
having taken place atKuso, Shango hasthetitle of
Oha-Kuso, "King ofKuso."
Another myth makes Shango thesonofObatala,
andmarried tothethree river goddesses Oya,Oshun,
andOba,butreigning asanearthly king atOyo. The
story relates thatonedayShango obtained from his


CHIEF GODS. 53
father Obatala apowerful cliarm, wliicli, wlien eaten,
would enable liim tovanquisli allwtioopposed him.
Shango atemost ofthemedicament, andthenga^e
theresttoOya tokeep forhim ;but she,assoon as
hisbackwasturned, atetherestherself. Nextmorn-
ingthechiefs and elders assembled atthepalace as
usual, tojudge the affairs ofthepeople, andeach
spoke inhisturn ;butwhen itcame toShango's turn
tospeak, flames burst forthfrom hismouth, and all
fledinterror. Oya, too,when shebegan toscold her
women inthepalace, similarly belched forth flames, so
thateverybody ranaway, andthepalace wasdeserted.
Shango nowsawthathewas, asagod, inferior to
none ;socalling histhree wives tohim,andtaking in
hishand along iron-chain, hestamped ontheearth
till itopened under him,anddescended into itwith
hiswives. The earth closed again overthem, after
theyhadgonedown, buttheendofthechain wasleft
protruding from theground.
Thismyth well exemplifies theconfusion thathas
nowbeen created inmen's minds between thethunder-
godproper andthedemi-god, theresult being akind
ofcompound Shango, possessing attributes ofeach.
TheShango ofthis story resembles inhismarital
relations thethunder-god, butthedescent into the
earth with theiron chain, theend ofwhich isleft
above ground, islikethelegendary descent ofthe
deified king, and isprobably only another version of
thesame event. Itisprobable that contact with
Mohammedans hashadsomething todowith the
invention ofthismyth. The genii, asweread of
them inthe"Arabian Nights," arefrequently de-
scribed asbreathing forth flames todestroy their

beones atalllikely toliave arisen spontaneously in
thenegro mind, andwefindnothing ofthesortinthe
groups cognate totheYoruba. Moreover, athunder-
godmust, from thevery nature ofhisbeing, hve
above theearth amongst theclouds ;andtomakehim
descend into thebowels ofthe earth, istoplace
him inasituation where hecould notexercise the
functions ofhisoffice. These remarks equally apply
tothefollowing myth.
Since hisdescent into theearth with histhree
wives atOyo, Shango hasoften come back tothe
world. One day,whendown intheearth, hequar-
relled withOya,whohadstolen some ofhis"medi-
cines ;"and she, terrified athisviolence, ranaway,
andtook refuge with her brother theSea-God
(Olokun). Assoon asShango discovered where she
hadgone, heswore agreat oath tobeathersothat
shewould never forget it.Next morning hecame
upfrom below with theSun, and,following him in
hiscourse alltheday,arrived withhimintheevening
attheplace where theseaandsky join, and so
descended withhimintotheterritories ofhisbrother
Olokun. TheSunhadnotknowingly shown Shango
theroad across theskytoOlokun's palace, forShango
hadbeen careful tokeep behind him allthetime,
nearly outofsight, and tohidewhen theSunlooked
round.
When Shango reached Olokun's palace andsawhis
wifeOya there, hemade agreat noise andcommotion.

Herushed towards liertoseize her,butOlokun held
him ;and"while thetwowere struggling together 0ja
escaped, andran tohidewith her sister Olosa (the
Lagoon). "When Olokun sawthatOyahadgone he
released Shango, who,nowmore furious than ever,
ranafter hiswife cursing andthreatening her. In
hisrage hetoreupthetrees bjtheir roots, ashe
ranalong, tossing them hereand there. Oja, look-
ingoutfrom hersister's house, sawhimcoming along
thebanks ofthelagoon, and,knowing that Olosa
could notprotect her,ranoutagain, andfledalong
theshores towards theplace where theSun goes
down. Asshewas running, andShango coming
behind, roaring andyelling, shesaw ahouse near at
hand, and, rushing into it,claimed protection ofa
manwhom shefound there, whose name was Huisi.
Shebegged Huisi todefend her. Huisi asked what
he,aman, could doagainst Shango ;butOyagave
him toeatofthe"medicines"shehadstolen from
herhusband, and he,being thusmade anorisha,
promised toprotect her. AsShango approached,
Huisi ranfrom hishousedown tothebanks ofthe
lagoon, and tearing upalarge treebytheroots,
brandished itinthe air,anddefied Shango. There
being noother tree there, Shango seized Huisi's
canoe, shook itlike aclub, andthetwoweapons,
striking together, were shattered topieces. Then
thetwo orishas wrestled together. Flames burst
from their mouths, andtheir feettoregreat fissuresmtheearth astheydragged each other toand fro.

Ifa,god ofdivination, who isusually termed the
G-od ofPalm Nuts, because sixteen palm-nuts areused
intheprocess ofdivination, comes after Shango in
order ofeminence. Thename Ifaapparently means
something scraped orwiped off :hehasthe title of
Grbangba (explanation, demonstration, proof). Ifa's
secondary attribute istocause fecundity :hepresides
atbirths, andwomen pray tohimtobemade fruitful;
while onthisaccount offerings arealways made to
himbefore marriage, itbeing considered adisgrace
nottobear children. Tothenative mind there isno
conflict offunction between IfaandObatala, forthe
former causes thewoman tobecome pregnant, while
thelatter forms thechild inthewomb, which issup-
posed tobeadifferent thing altogether.

theywould notlisten tohim, soheleftthetown and
wandered about theworld teaching mankind. After
roaming about foralong time, andindulging ina
variety ofamours, Ifafixed hisresidence atAdo,
where heplanted onarock apalm-nut, from which
sixteen palm-trees grewupatonce.
Ifahasanattendant orcompanion named Odu

(ojje, puzzle, orope, palm-tree). The bandicoot
(oTcete) issacred tohim,because itlives chiefly upon
palm-nuts. The firstdayoftheYoruba week isIfa's
holy day,and iscalled ajoawo, "dayofthesecret."
Onthisdaysacrifices ofpigeons, fowls, andgoats are
made tohim,andnobody canperform anybusiness
before accomplishing this duty. Onvery important
occasions ahuman victim isimmolated.
Apriest ofIfa istermed ahabalawo (baha-ni-aioo),

thing ofimportance without consulting thegod,and

Hence aproverb says, "The priest who ismore

Thegeneral belief isthat Ifapossessed thefaculty
ofdivination from thebeginning, butthere isamyth
which makes himacquire theartfrom thephallic god
Elegba. Intheearly days oftheworld, saysthemyth,
there were butfewpeople ontheearth, andthegods
found themselves stinted inthematter ofsacrifices to
suchanextent that, notobtaining enough toeatfrom
theofferings made bytheir followers,* they were
obliged tohave recourse tovarious pursuits inorder
toobtain food. Ifa,whowas inthesame straits as
theother gods, took tofishing, with, however, but
small success ;andoneday,when hehad failed to
catch any fish atall,andwasvery hungry, he
consulted thecrafty Elegba, whowas also inwant,
astowhat theycould dotoimprove their condition.
Elegba replied that ifhecould only obtain
the sixteen palm-nuts from the two pahns
thatOrungan,t the chief man,had inhisplanta-
tion, hewould show Ifahow toforecast the
future; and thathecould then usehisknowledge
intheservice ofmankind, andsoreceive anabund-
ance ofofferings. Hestipulated that inreturn for
instructing Ifaintheartofdivination, heshould
always beallowed the first choice ofallofferings
made.. Ifaagreed tothebargain, andgoing to
Orungan, asked forthesixteen palm-nuts, explaining

however, were toolofty forthem tobeable toreach
thepalm-nuts, and thestems toosmooth tobe
climbed; sothey retired toalittle distance and
drove somemonkeys thatwere inthevicinity into
thepalms. Nosooner were themonkeys inthe
trees than they seized thenuts, and, after eating the
redpulp thatcovered them, threw thehard kernels
down ontheground, where Orungan and hiswife
picked them up.Having collected thewhole sixteen,
Orisha-bi tiedthem upinapiece ofcloth, andput
thebundle under herwaist-cloth, onherback, asif
shewere carrying achild. Then they carried the
palm-nuts toIfa. Elegba kept hispromise and
taught Ifatheartofdivination, andIfainhisturn
taught Orungan, whothnsbecame the first habalaiuo,
Itisinmemory ofthese events thatwhen aman
wishes toconsult Ifa,hetakes hiswife with him,
ifhebemarried, andhismother ifhebesingle, who
carries thesixteen palm-nuts, tiedupinabundle,

James Hamilton, indeed, describes *avery similar
mode ofdivination wliicli liesaw intheoasis of

jump intotherighthand—ifanoddnumber, one is

Ifa fio-ures inconnection witli alegendary deluge,
tliestory ofwhich, now adapted totheYoruba
theology, wasprobably derived from theMoham-
medans. Some time after settling atAdo, Ifabe-
came tired ofliving intheworld, andaccordmgly
went todwell inthefirmament, with Obatala.
After his departure, mankind, deprived ofhis
assistance, was unable toproperly interpret the
desires ofthegods, most ofwhom becamemcon-
sequence annoyed. Olokun was themost angry,
and inafitofrage hedestroyed nearly allthe
inhabitants oftheworld inagreat flood, only a
fewbeing saved byObatala, whodrewthem upinto
theskybymeans ofalong iron chain. After this
ebullition ofanger, Olokun retired oncemore tohis
own domains, buttheworld wasnothing butmud,
and quite unfit tolive in, tillIfacamedown from

(7)Blegba.
Blegba, orBlegbara (Blegba-Bara), often called
Eshu, isthesame phallic divinity whowasdescribed
inthevolume ontheEwe-speaking Peoples. The
name Blegba seems tomean,"Hewho seizes"
(Eni-gha), andBara isperhaps Oha-ra, "Lord ofthe
rubbing"{Bci, torubonething against another).
Bshu appears tobefrom sliu, toemit, throw out,
evacuate, Thepropensity tomake mischief, which


CHIEF GODS. 65
wenoted asaminor characteristic oftheEwe
Blegba, ismuch more prominent intheYoruba god,
who thusmore nearly approaches apersonification
ofevil.He issupposed always tocarry ashort
knobbed club, which, originally intended tobearude
representation ofthe^phallus, has,partly through want
ofskillonthepart ofthemodellers oftheimages, and
partly through thegrowing belief inElegba's malevo-
lence, come toberegarded asaweapon ofoffence.*
Because hebears this club hehasthe title of
Agongo ogo. Ogo isthename oftheknobbed club,
and ismost probably aeuphemism forthe'phallus;
itisderived from go,tohide inabending orstooping
posture. The derivation ofagongo islesseasy to
determine, but itseems tobefrom gongo, tip,
extremity.
Theimage ofElegba, who isalways represented
naked, seated with hishands onhisknees, andwith
animmensely disproportionate phallus, isfound in
front ofalmost every house, protected byasmall
hutroofed with palm-leaves. Itiswith reference
tothisthattheproverb says :"AsEshw hasamali-
cious disposition, hishouse ismade forhim inthe
street "(instead ofindoors). Therudewooden repre-
sentation ofthephallus isplanted intheearth bythe
side ofthehut,and isseen inalmost every public
place;while atcertain festivals itisparaded ingreat
pomp, andpointed towards theyoung girls,whodance
round it.
Elegba, inconsequence ofthebargain hemade with

Ifa,receives asliare ofevery sacrifice offered tothe
other gods. Hisownproper sacrifices are,asamong
theEwe tribes, cocks, dogsandhe-goats, chosen on
account oftheir amorous propensities ;butonvery
important occasions ahuman victim isoffered. In
such acase, after thehead hasbeen struck off,the
corpse isdisembowelled, andtheentrails placed infront
oftheimage inalarge calabash orwooden dish;after
which thebody issuspended from atree, or,ifnotree
beathand, from ascaffolding ofpoles. Turkey-
buzzards aresacred toBlegba andareconsidered his
messengers, nodoubt because theydevour theentrails
andbodies ofthesacrifices.
There isanoted temple toElegba inagrove of
palms nearWuru, avillage situated about tenmHes
totheeast ofBadagry.Themarket ofWuru isunder
hisprotection, andeachvendor throws afewcowries
ontheground asathank-offering. Once ayear these
cowries areswept upbythepriests, andwith thesum
thus collected aslave ispurchased tobesacrificed to
thegod.Aslave isalso sacrificed annually, towards
theend ofJuly, toBlegba inthetown ofOndo, the
capital ofthe state ofthesame name. Elegba's
principal residence issaid tobeonamountain named
Igbeti, supposed tobesituated near theNiger. Here
hehasavastpalace ofbrass, andalargenumber of
attendants.
Circumcision among theYorubas, asamong the
Ewes, isconnected with theworship ofBlegba, and
appears tobeasacrifice ofaportion oftheorgan
which thegodinspires, toensure thewell-being ofthe
remainder. Tocircumcise isdalco (da-olco) da,tobe

curDcision isiheyiha, orilwla, theformer ofwliicli
means "tliecircular cutting "{ike,theactofcutting,
andiyeka, acircuit), andthelatter, "thecutting that

saves). Except among theMohammedans there isno
special time forperforming therite ofcircumcision,
itbeing fixed foreach individual bjIfa,after consul-
tation, butusually itisdone early inlife.Nowoman
would have connection with anuncircumcised man.Asimilar operation isperformed ongirls,who are
excised, bywomen operators, shortly before puberty,
that is,between theages oftenandtwelve years.
As isthecase inthewestern half oftheSlave
Coast, erotic dreams areattributed toElegba, who,
either asafemale ormale, consorts sexually withmen
andwomen during their sleep, andsofulfils inhisown
person thefunctions oftheincuU andsuccuU of
medi£Bval Europe.
(S)Ogun.
Ogun isthegodofironandofwar,and, likeShango,
isalsoapatron ofhunters. Iron issacred tohim,
andwhen swearing byOgun itisusual totouch an
ironimplement with thetongue. ThenameOgun
seems tomean "Onewhopierces "{gun, topierce, or
thrust with something pointed). He isspecially
worshipped byblacksmiths, andbythosewhomake
useofironweapons ortools. Any piece ofironcan
beused asasymbol ofOgun, andtheground issacred

Tlieusual sacrifice offered toOgunis adog,together
witli fowls, palm oil,andminor articles offood.A
proverb says,"An olddogmust besacrificed to
Ogun," meaning thatOgun claims thebest; anda
dog's head, emblematic ofthis sacrifice, isalways to
be'seen fastened upinsome conspicuous part ofthe
workshops ofblacksmiths. Onveryimportant occa-
sions, however, ahuman victim isoffered, and, asm
thecase ofasacrifice toElegba, the entrails are
exposed before theimage andthebody suspended
from atree. Thevictim isslainbyhaving hishead
struck offupon thestool ofOgun, overwhich theblood
ismade togush. Thereason ofthis isthattheblood
isbeheved tocontain thevital principle, andtherefore
tobeanoffering particularly acceptable tothegods.
This belief appears tobecommon tomost bar-
barous peoples ;theIsraelites held it,*andblood
was considered tobesopeculiarly theportion of
their national god,thattheblood ofallanimals slam,
whether forsacrifice orfood,hadtobepresented as
anoffering, noonebeing allowed toeat itunder
pain ofdeath.t
When warhasbeen decided upon, aslave ispur-
chased attheexpense ofthetown, ortribe, and
offered asasacrifice toOgun, toensure success. The
daybefore thatonwhich heistobeimmolated, the
victim isledwith great ceremony through theprin-
cipal thoroughfares, andparaded inthemarket,
where heisallowed tosayordoanything hepleases
(short ofescaping hisimpending fate),may gratify his

desire witlianywoman wliotakes liisfancy, andgive
histongue every licence. Tliereason ofliisbeing
thushonoured forthetwenty-four hours before being
sacrificed, isthat itisbelieved hewillbeborn again
andbecome aking;and, after thehead hasbeen
struck off,thecorpse istreated with thegreatest
respect by all.Inorder forthis sacrifice tobe
effective, itisnecessary that thewarleaders should
take the field before thebody begins tobecome
offensive. The Ibadans, whoappear toberather
averse tohuman sacrifice, always used toperform
thisdutybydeputy, paying thepriests ofIfetosacri-
ficeforthem aslave inthat town. When thewar
of1877began theyomitted todothis,thinking that
theaffair would notbeserious;and, attributing their
subsequent want ofsuccess totheomission, they after-
wards sacrificed aslave toOgun intheircamp at
Kijiin1885, theyhaving been prevented from doing
itearlier bytheir leader, aMohammedan, who died
inthatyear.
The priests ofOgun usually takeoutthehearts of
human victims, which aredried, reduced topowder,
thenmixed withrum,and sold topersons whowish
tobeendowed with great courage, andwho drink
themixture. Thereason ofthis isthat theheart is
believed tobetheseat ofcourage and toinherently
possess that quality ;andthatwhen theheart is
devoured orswallowed thequality withwhich itis
inspired isalsotaken intothesystem.
