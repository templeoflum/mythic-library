"What willyou giveme ifIpiiUyouout?"
asked Tortoise. "Iwill beyour slave," replied
Sigo. "Very well," said Tortoise, thebald-headed
elf.
Tortoise climbed down intothegully andtook Sigo
out.Hesaid tohim, "Iamgoing tomake alarge
drum, and shall putyou inside it."When wecome
toanyhouse, andIbegin playing onthedrum, take
care thatyou sing well." "Iunderstand," said
Sigo.
When hereached thetown inwhich helived,
Tortoise, thebald-headed elf,went tothekingand
boasted ofthe finesound ofhisdrum. Theking
ordered Tortoise tobring thedrum andbeat itinhis
presence, sothathecould hearthesound.
"Very well," said Tortoise; "send and call all

andhesent allthrough thetown toinvite thepeople
tocome anddance.
When allthepeople hadassembled theking sent

Hebeat thedrum with the stick, andthedrum
sounded, saying:—
