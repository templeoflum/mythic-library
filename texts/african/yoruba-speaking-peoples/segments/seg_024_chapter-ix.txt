CHAPTER IX.
CEREMONIES ATBIRTH, MARRIAGE, ANDDEATH.
I.AtBirth.
Theceremonies atbirtli resemble intliemain tliose
observed bytlieEwe-speaking peoples, anddescribed
inthelastvolume, buttbere areafewchanges whicli
maybeattributed toincreased priestly influence.
Assoon asthepangs oflabour seize awoman a
priestess takes charge ofher,andhasthecare of
herandthe child; while, soon after thechild is
born, ahabalawo appears onthescene toascertain
what ancestral soulhasbeen re-born intheinfant.
Assoon asthis important point isdecided, the
parents areinformed that thechild must conform
inallrespects tothemanner oflifeoftheancestor
whonowanimates it;and if,asoften happens, they
profess ignorance, thehabalawo supplies thenecessary
knowledge.
Seven days after birth, ifthechild beagirl,nine
days, ifitbeaboy, thehabalatvo comes again and
offers asacrifice ofacock and ahen toIfaand
theOlori, orindwelling spirit ofthechild's head;
after which, inorder toprevent Elegba from inter-
fering with themother and child, theentrails ofthe

two sacrifices aresprinkled with palm-wine, taken
outside thehouse, andplaced before hisimage.
Then follows aceremony which appears tobeone
ofpurification, forhere, asamong theTshiandEwe
tribes, themother and child areconsidered unclean,
asarewomen during themenses. Thewater which
isalways intheearthen vessels placed before the
images ofthegods, isbrought tothehouse and
thrown uponthethatched roof, and asitdrips
down from theeaves themother and child pass
three times through thefalling drops. Thehabalawo
nextmakes awater ofpurification with which he
bathes thechild's head, herepeats three times the
name bywhich theinfant istobeknown, andthen
holds him inhisarms sothat hisfeettouch the
ground. After these ceremonies have been duly
performed the fire isextinguished andtheembers
carried away;thehouse isthen carefully swept out,
live coals arebrought, andafresh firelighted. We
thusappear tohave acombination ofapurification
bywater andapurification byfire. After thenew
firehasbeen kindled, another sacrifice offowls is
made toIfa,andtheproceedings areatanend.
II.AtMaeriage.
When aman desires tomarry agirl, hisparents
visit herparents andmake proposals ofmarriage.
Ifthey areaccepted, thesuitor sends apresent of
native cloths and kola-nuts, and, after consulting a
habalawo, aday isappointed fortheweddino-.


354 THEYOIUJBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
The marriage-feast isheld atthehouse ofthe
parents ofthebridegroom, and thebride iscon-
ducted there byaprocession ofwomen, who sing
anepithalamium. The bride isput tobedbya
female ofthebridegroom's family, who remains
concealed intheapartment tillthebridegroom has
joined thebride ;afterwhich shesecures the"tokens
ofvirginity," and,coming outoftheroom, displays
them totheassembled company. Shethen carries
them tothehouse oftheparents ofthebride,who
never attend adaughter's wedding-feast, andnext
morning they arehung onthefence fortheedifica-
tion ofthepublic. Inthisabstention ofthebride's
parents from the feasting andmerrymaking, we
perhaps findalingering survival from marriage by
capture. Theproducer ofthe"tokens "isselected
from thefamily ofthebridegroom toensure that
there isnodeception, because thehusband's family
hasnointerest infalsifying the facts, while the
wife's family has ;butvirginity inabride isonly
ofparamount importance when the girlhasbeen
betrothed inchildhood. Themarriage-feast iscon-
tinued onthenext day.
Itisnotuncommon fornewly-married couples
tovisitsome celebrated shrine and offer sacrifice
together, apractice which, together with thefixing
ofthewedding-day byahabalaioo, shows anin-
creasing disposition onthepart ofthepriests to
control orinterfere with matters which arepurely
social andquitebeyond thedomain ofreligion.

III.AtDeath.
THeceremonies observed bytheYoruba tribes at
death chiefly differ from those oftheEwe tribes in
theaddition ofvarious religious observances.
When thebreath hasdeparted from thebody there
istheusual outburst ofexaggerated grief, with loud
cries, lamentations, and frenzied gestures, andthe
eldest sonofthedeceased, orthebrother, ifthere be
noson, atonce sends forabahalawo, toascertain if
thedeceased diedfrom natural causes, orthrough the
machinations ofwitches. The hahalaivo, after sacri-
ficing afowl, inquires attheoracle ofIfa,bymeans
oftheboard andsixteen palm-nuts ;and ifitaflSrms
that thedeath wascaused bywitchcraft, further
mquiry ismade toknow ifanyothermember ofthe
family isthreatened with alike fate,and also ifthe
soul ofthedeceased isindanger offurther molesta-
tionfrom theevil spirits whohave been influenced
bythemalpractices ofthe sorcerers. Should the
oracle declare that thesoul ofthedeceased isin
danger, asheep orgoat issacrificed, andthecarcass,
sprinkled with palm-oil, iscarried outside thetown,
anddeposited ataspotwhere two ormore paths
meet, which hastheeffect ofcausing theevil spirits
todisperse inasmany directions asthere arepaths.
ThehahalaiDO then prepares theusual water ofpuri-
fication with shea-butter andedible snails, and dip-
ping into thevessel apalm-branch, sacred toIfa,
sprinkles thecorpse, theroom, andthespectators
with thefluid. Atthesame timeheinvokes thesoul

oftliedeceased toleave theliouse assoon astlie
funeral rites liavebeen performed, andproceed peace-
fully toitsdestination, wishing itasafejourney. He
says,"May tlieroad beopen toyou.May nothing
evilmeet youontheway.Mayyou findtheroad
goodwhen yougoinpeace."
After these preliminaries, thecorpse iswashed with
rum, oradecoction ofaromatic herbs, andattired in
itsbest clothes. Thethumbs andthegreat toes are
then tiedtogether. Ifthedeceased beaman the
head isshaved, andthehair, carefully wrapped upin
apiece ofwhite cotton, isburied intheearth behind
thehouse. Ifawoman, theexposed parts ofthe
body arestained with adecoction ofthebark ofa
tree,which gives areddish huetotheskin. Tinally,
thecorpse iswrapped upinmany native cloths, and
placed onamatatthedoor oftheroom.
Inthemeantime adeath-feast hasbeen prepared,
andnowcommences, while outside thehouse acon-
tinual beating ofdrums iskept up,together with
frequent discharges ofmusketry, fired inhonour of
thedeceased. The feast, atwhich intoxicants are
used lavishly, soonbecomes averitable orgie, inwhich,
however, thechief mourners, that is,thewidows and
daughters ofthedeceased, takenopart ;forassoon
astheyhave performed thelast offices forthedead,
andhave placed thecorpse atthedoor, they areshut
upinanadjacent apartment, where they arecom-
pelled bycustom toremain during thethree days

twenty-four lioiirs, after wliicli tliey usually allow
tliemselves tobepersuaded totakesome nourisliment.
Theconventional mo,urning istliebusiness ofthe
women ofthehousehold, who, while themen are
feasting, utter loudlamentations intheroom inwhich
they areconfined;and, inconsequence ofthis, the
epithet isohun, "amourner," isoften applied toa
female child ;amale, ontheother hand, being some-
times called kvale, "adigger," i.e., ofagrave.A
father might thus saythat hehadbegotten two
mourners andadigger, meaning twodaughters anda
son. Female friends usually come tojoin inthe
lamentations, theconventional character ofwhich is
referred tointheproverb "Amourner mourns and
goesonherway(without afterthought), butonewho
ponders oversadmemories mourns without ceasing."
There arealsoprofessional mourners, chosen fortheir
poetical turn ofexpression, whose services areen-
gaged inwell-to-do households, andwho often con-
trive toworkuptherealmourners toacondition of
frenzied grief.Aprofessional mourner sings inasad
tone,which rises,and falls inamodulated wail ;"He
isgone, thelionofaman. Hewasnotasapling, or
abush, tobetornoutoftheearth, butatree—atree
tobrave thehurricane ;aspreading tree,under which
thehearts ofhisfamily could restinpeace," &c.&c.;
while thewidows anddaughters lament their lonely
andimprotected state, somewhat asfollows :—
"Igotothemarket ;itiscrowded. There are
many people there, butheisnotamong them. I
wait, buthecomes not.Ahme !Iamalone.
"Never more shall Iseehim. Itisover ;heis

gone. Ishall seeliimnomore. Allme !Iam
alone.
"Igointo tliestreet. Thepeople pass, butheis
notthere. ISTight falls, buthecomes not.Ahme !
Iamalone.
"Alas !Iamalone. Alone intheday—alone in
thedarkness ofthenight. Alas !myfather (orhus-
band) isdead. Who willtake care ofme?"
Ontheafternoon ofthethird dayofthewake the
body isplaced onsome boards, oronadoortaken off
itshinges, covered with arich native cloth, and
borne atatrotthrough thestreets bythemen. Male
friends and relations accompany thebier, singing the
praises ofthedeceased, andthrowing handfuls of
cowries among the spectators. This procession re-
turns tothehouse towards evening, andthecorpse is
then interred inagrave that hasbeendug inthe
earthen floor, andwhich issocontrived thatthehead
ofthedeceased may project beyond the line ofthe
outer wall ofthehouse. Most ofthecloths inwhich
thecorpse iswrapped aretaken off,andthebody,
covered with grass mats sothatnoearthmay soil it,
iscarefully lowered intothegrave.Acoffin issome-
times used, butnotoften. Food, rum, andcowries
areplaced inthegrave, thebody issprinkled with
theblood ofahe-goat, sacrificed topropitiate Blegba,
afewmore cowries arethrown in,andthen thegrave
isfilled upamid thewishes forasafeandpleasant
journey towhich wehave already referred.*
When thegrave isfulltheearth issmoothed down,

andsometimes, wlienmany articles ofvalue liavebeen
entombed, the surface ismoistened with, water to
make theearth settle down, and slaves anddepen-
dents aremade tosleep onitnight after night, for
thedouble purpose ofjDrotecting itand ofobliter-
atiDg alltrace ofitsexact position. After theinter-
ment, thefeast, which hadbeen suspended since the
afternoon, recommences ;anddrinking andshouting,
amid the firing ofmuskets, thejangle ofnative
gongs, andthedullthud ofthedrums, continues all
night.
Next day,about noon, themale relations walk out
inabody, andwander about thetown, asiflooking
forthedeceased, andchanting "Welook forour
father, andcannot findhim"; towhich thebystanders
reply, "Hehasgone tohishouse." Returning from
this,themourners carry onthefeast tilltheevening
ofthenext day,when thebones ofthevictims that
havebeen sacrificed, andthose ofthefowls andsheep
thathave been eatenbytheguests, arecollected and
placed over thegrave. Allthe articles which the
deceased had indaily use,such ashispipe, themat
onwhich heslept, theplate orvessel fromwhich he
ate,hiscalabashes, andother things ofsmall value,
arecarried outintothebushandburned.
Uptothispoint thesoul ofthedeceased issup-
posed tohave been lingering near hisoldhome, and
thisdestruction ofhisproperty isintended tosignify
tothesoulthathemustnow depart, since there isno
longer anything belonging tohim. Informer times
thedestruction ofproperty wascarried much further
than atpresent. Usually theapartment inwhich


160 THEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
tliedeceased isburied isclosed, andnever used again,
andsometimes tlieroof isremoved. Eicli families
evenabandon tlieliouse altogether, and itissaidto
have been usual indaysbygone toburn it. Tlie
deceased iscalled tliree times byname, andadjured
todepart, andnolonger haunt thedwellings ofthe
living. After this invitation tobegone, thefowl,
called adire-iranna* issacrificed, which, besides se-
curing aright-of-way forthe soul, issupposed also
toguide it.The feathers ofthefowl arescattered
around thehouse, andthebird itself carried outtoa
bush-road, where itiscooked and eaten. Theroad
onwhich theaclire-iranna iseatenmust beoutside the
town andleadaway from it,forthough thenatives
believe thatDeadland isunder theearth, theythink
that itisnecessary toeatthefowlonaroad leading
intothebush, inorder toplace itinaproper position
forcommencing itsofiice ofguide tothesoul.
The relations may notwash themselves orcomb
their hair during thefuneral ceremonies, inconse-
quence ofwhich the rites themselves aresometimes
styled Ofo,"Unwashed." Onthelastdaytheyshave
their heads, andthen pay visits ofthanks tothose
who assisted atthefuneral. Thetime ofmourning
after theconclusion ofthese ceremonies varies with
therank andinfluence ofthedeceased, andwith the
locality. Three months isusually considered long
enough, butacommemoration-feast isoften held a
year after thedeath. During theperiod ofmourning
thehairmust beleftunkempt asitgrows, andwomen

must cover theliead witli acloth ofadark blue
colour. Awidow remains shutupforforty days,and
maynotwash hercloths during that time.
Itisconsidered thegreatest disgrace toafamily
nottobeable tohold theproper ceremonies atthe
death ofoneoftheir number, anotion which iscom-
prehensible whenweremember howmuch thewelfare
ofthesoul ofthedeceased issupposed todepend
upon their performance. Hence families notun-
frequently reduce themselves almost tobeggary in
order tocarrythem out,orpawn orselltheir children
toraise themoney necessary. Sometimes, too,they
conceal thedeath andhide thebody until theyhave
secured therequisite means, andsuch concealments
have beenknown tolastforthree orfourmonths.
Thebody istreated with resinous herbs sothat it
becomes desiccated, and,while itremains inthehouse,
thesoul isbelieved toabide initsoldhome, where
foodanddrink areprovided for it,tillsuch time as
theproper ceremonies canbeheld,and itbeleg-iti-
mately ushered onitsnew career.
Acommon imprecation is01m igbe, "Bush
death," meaning "May you dieinthebush, alone
anduncared for,and soreceive nofuneral-rites."Aproverb contrasts aman's duties tohisrelations
with those towards themembers ofanysecret society
towhich hemay belong, such astheOgboni, and
msists upon theimportance oftheformer, because
oftheobligation upon hisrelations tobury him.
Itruns, "Amanmust honestly perform alltheduties
mcumbent onrelationship, eventhough hemaybelong
toasecret society. When hehasattended tothe

society liemust attend tohisrelations, because itis
theJwhomustbnryhimwhen hedies."
This desire foravery ceremonial funeral, which
•owes itsorigin tothenative beliefs concerning the
soul, lastslong after thenegro hasbeen transplanted
across theAtlantic, andhas lost allnotion ofits
motive. Inmost oftheWest India Islands, but
particularly intheBahamas, where thebulk ofthe
negro population isofYoruba descent, agrand
funeral isconsidered thegreatest desideratum. To
attain this end, burial-societies areformed, the
members ofwhich paysubscriptions alltheir lives
inorder tobeburied withpomp. Every member
ofsuch asociety isbound toattend thefuneral of
another member, andthe result isaprocession of
men inuniforms, more orless grotesque, with
banners andvarious insignia. Often aband heads
the cortege, andmany aman occupies his last
moments ingiving directions astothemanner in
which thefuneral istotake place.*
