CHAPTER VII.
THEINDWELLING- SPIRITS ANDSOULS OFMEN.
Inthe firstvolume ofthis serieswefound that the
Tshi-speaking peoples believe that every man has
dwelling inhim aspirit termed akra,which enters
himatbirth and quitshim atdeath, and isentirely
distinct from the soul, which, atthedeath ofthe
body, proceeds totheLand oftheDead, andthere
continues the lifeformerly ledbytheman inthe
world. Inthesecond volume, wefound that theEwe-
speaking peoples have asimilar belief, theindwelling
spirit being bythem termed aluwo. TheGra-speaking
tribes, situated geographically between theTshiand
Ewe tribes, have modified this belief, andthey assign
toeach individual twoindwelling spirits, called Ida,
onemale andonefemale, theformer being ofabad
andthelatter ofagood disposition. Each Ida,like
thekraandtheluwo, isaguardian-spirit, but—andthis
isanewdeparture—theygivegood orbadadvice, and
prompt good orbad actions, according totheir re-
spective dispositions. TheYorubas alsohave modified
what appears tobetheoriginal theory ofone in-
dwelling andguardian-spirit, andtheyholdthateach
manhasthree spiritual inmates, the first ofwhom,


126 rilEYORUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Olori, dwells inthehead, thesecond, Jpm ijeun, inthe
stomach, andthethird, Ijpori, inthegreat toe.
Olori {Oni-ori, owner, orlord, ofthehead) some-
times called Ori(head, faculty, talent), seems tobe
the spirit which answers tothehraorluwo. He is
theprotector, guardian, and guide. Offerings are
made tohim, chiefly fowls, aswith thekraandluwo,
andsome oftheblood, mixed with palm-oil, isrubbed
upon theforehead. Olori brings good-fortuue, whence
theproverb, "Olori causes theowner ofthehead
toprosper, andnotthecrabonthebank oftheriver."
Thesymbol ofOlori ishalfacalabash studded over
with cowries.
I]jin ijeun, oripinojelmn (ipin, share, portion; ijeun,
actofeating, from jeohun, toeat ;hence "hewho
shares inthefood"), isperhaps considered themost
important ofthethree indwelling spirits, butashe
shares inallthat theman eats, hehasnospecial
sacrifice offered tohim.Aproverb says, "There
isnoorisha like thestomach; itreceives food
every day." Insome respects hunger (ebi) seems
tobepersonified, and tobeconsidered theagent
ofIpin ijeun; forhe issaid tocommunicate to
theman,bypinching hisstomach, thedesire ofhis
principal forfood. Curiously enough, Ipin ijeun is
connected with fire-worship. There isamong the
Yorubas nogod offire,answering totheEwegod
Dso,but fire{ina)wasprobably once personified, for
itisstillspoken ofasAbanigbele, "theInmate." It
isnotclearbywhat process fire-worship came tobe
blended with that oftheindwelling spirit ofthe
stomach; butthe natives explain theconnection


THEINDWELLING SPIRITS ANDSOULS OFMEN. 127
between tlietwobysaying tliat fire isnecessary for
thepreparation offood,andfood isnecessary toIpin
ijeun, therefore hetakes fireunder hisprotection, and
takes care that itisnotextinguished. Aproverbial
saying runs, "I]yin ijeun doesnotallow firetodepart
from theearth." When firecould onlybeproduced
bythetedious process ofrubbing together two sticks,
itwasnodoubt important tokeeponeortwoembers
ofafirealways smouldering.
Ipoi'i, thegreat toe, istheleast important ofthe
three guardian spirits, and sacrifice israrely offered
tohim,except when aman isabout tosetoutona
journey ;inwhich caseheanoints thegreat toewith a
mixture offowl's blood andpalm-oil. Waterfowl are
apparently "unclean "forthispurpose, foraproverb
says,"Awaterfowl isnot fitfortheworship ofI]Jori''
Theghost-man, orsoul, the"vehicle ofindividual
personal existence," iscalled iwin, orolmn, butthe
latter alsomeans "heart." Another word isojiji, or
oji,which hasthemeanings ofghost, shade, or
shadow. After thedeath ofthebody, theghost-man
goes toIpo-ohu, "theLand oftheDead"{fyo,
place; oJm, dead), which isbeneath theearth, and
where eachmandoes thatwhich hehasbeen accus-
tomed todo,andholds thesame social position ashe
didintheworld. Toenable theghost toreach this
land itisessential thatheshould have theprescribed
funeral rites performed over him. Should they be
omitted, theghost wanders about theworld, cold,
hungry, andhomeless, andheruns therisk ofbeing
seized bysome ofthe evil spirits which roam about
theearth ingreat numbers, and castbythem into


128 THEYORUBA-SPEAKfNG PEOPLES.
Orun-aiMcli,"tlieunseen world ofpotsherds," an
uncomfortable place likeapottery furnace, heaped
upwith charcoal andthedebris ofbroken earthen
pots. Funeral rites cannot, ofcourse, beperformed
atthemoment thatbreath leaves thebody, butas
anearnest oftheir intention toperform them, and to
prevent the evil spirits from seizing theghost, the
relations atonce offer asacrifice topropitiate them;
andwhen thecorpse isburied, afowl, called Aclire-
iranna*"thefowl thatbuys theroad," that is,"that
opens aright ofway," issacrificed.
Acomparison ofthe beliefs heldbyuncivilised
peoples concerning thedead, seems toshow thatwhen
inavery low state ofculture, theghost, nodoubt
from theassociation ofideas, isheld toremain inthe
vicinity ofthegrave inwhich thebody wasinterred;
andthatthenotion ofadistinct andseparate place
ofabode forthedead, orDeadland, isonlyformed
when ahigher degree ofculture isattained. The
first belief often lingers onalongside thesecond,
asinEngland, where thechurchyard isconsidered
tobethemost likely place inwhich toseeaghost;
andasimilar survival among theYorubas, oratrace
oftheformer belief, isfound intheword iboji, "a
grave," which means, literally, "place oftheghost"
(ihi,place;oji,ghost).
Thedead often return toearth, andarebornagam
inthefamilies towhich theybelonged intheirformer
life. Infact,onemight saythattheyalways retiirn,
since every mother sends forahahalawo totellher
*Adire, afowl; iranna, tlieactofpurchasing aright ofway,from
ra,tobuy,andona, road.


THEINDWELLING SPIltTTS AXDSOULSOFMEN. ]20
what ancestral ghost liasanimated liernew-born
child, andthehahalaioo always tells herwhich itis.
Asthebirths atleast equal innumber thedeaths,
andtheprocess ofbeing re-born issupposed tohave
gone on"from thebeginning," logically there ought
tobefew, ifany, departed souls inDeadland ;but
thenatives donot critically examine such questions
asthis,andthey imagine Deadland tobethickly
populated, and atthesame time every new-born
child, oralmost every one, tobeare-born ghost.
Aswasmentioned inthevolume ontheEwe-speaking
peoples,* this belief inmetempsychosis isprobably
aresult ofaconfusion between the noli, ordisem-
bodied luwo (inTshi, thesisa),andthesoul orghost-
man,andwemay here endeavour tosketch inthe
origin andprobable development ofthese various
beliefs.
There canbelittle reasonable doubt butthatthe
notion thatman possesses asoul, anentity that
continues hispersonality after death, arose from
dreams, after themanner shown byMr.Herbert
Spencer inhis"Principles ofSociology." fAman
dreams thatheisgoing through various adventures,
but, astheevidence ofhiscompanions shows him
thathehasnotreally lefttheir company, hecomes
totheconclusion thathehasasecond individuality,
something that ishimself andyet isdetachable, some-
thing thatcangooutofhim,anddoes sogooutwhen
heisasleep. Among thelower races allover the
world, dreams arebelieved tobetheadventures of

the spiritual man wliile detaclied from tliebodily
man during sleep. Then, asliedreams ofmen
whom heknows tobedead and buried, and
naturally dreams ofthem ashewasaccustomed to
seethem, heconcludes that thissecond individuality
canand does exist, entirely independently ofthe
body, after death, andpreserves theappearance and
characteristics ofthebodily-man. Atthisstage of
belief the spiritual-man, orlife-phantom, and the
soul, orghost-man, areoneandthesame. Then,
seemingly, insome cases, thissecond individuality
becomes divided intotwo separate entities— one, a
life-phantom, which enters thebody atbirth, goes
outandindulges inadventures during thesleep of
thebody, and quits itatdeath; theother, asoul,
ordeath-phantom, which, after death, continues the
lifeandpersonality oftheformer bodily-man.
Itispossible that thisconception oftwodifferent
entities wasbrought about, partly atleast, bythe
desire toexplain thereproduction byheredity of
physical characteristics. Children generally resemble
their parents, andfrequently reproduce theirmanner-
ismsmost remarkably. Assoon asthesavage begins
tospeculate atall,hebegins tothink ofthisphe-
nomenon, which cannot fail toarrest hisattention.
Hecan,andnodoubt often does,come tothecon-
clusion that thedead arereborn again intheir
descendants; heinvents the doctrine ofmetem-
psychosis ;but insome cases, andthenegro tribes
oftheGoldandSlave Coasts seem tobeexamples,
heappears tofeelthat thisexplanation isunsatis-
factory. And forthis reason. He stilldreams of


THEINDWELLING SPIRITS ANDSOULS OFMEN. 131
persons who aredead,whence hebelieves thatthey
exist after death; andhemust often dream ofdead
friends orrelations whose characteristics have been
reproduced intheir children, or,since theyhada
common ancestor, insome collateral member ofthe
same family. Hecannot, then, inthese cases,
conclude that thedead have returned toearth in
thepersons oftheir descendants; fortheevidence
ofhisdreams proves tohimthatthey still exist as
ghost-men, and areinevery respect asthey were
when alive intheworld. Ontheother hand, the
evidence ofhiseyesshows himthat their physical
peculiarities arereborn inchildren now living. He
therefore divides thesecond individuality intotwo—from, sotosay,theIra-soul, which wasoneentity,
hemakes two,theIraandthe soul, theformer of
which inhabits thebody during life,andafter death
enters anewhuman body inthesame family;while
thelatter remains dormant, asitwere, during life,
butafter death continues theexistence oftheman
asanindividual. The reproduction offeatures,
mannerisms, &c., isthus accounted forbythehra,
while thetheory ofthesoul satisfactorily accounts
forwhat the uncivilised man believes tobethe
incontestable evidence ofhisdreams.*
Ifthisview becorrect itwillprobably befound
that several other races have divided theoriginally
conceived entity intotwo. Thegenius natalis ofthe

Eomans resembled tlie Icraintliat itwasaguardian-
spirit which entered man atbirth, but, unlike the
hra, itperished atliisdeath. Itwascertainly quite
separate and distinct from the soul, orghost-man,
which went toHades. Wesayadvisedly that the
genius natalis dwelt inthemanfrom birth, because to
practise abstinence was"todefraud one's genius,"
andtoeat,drink, andbemerry was"toindulge one's
genius,'"*thusshowing thatthege^iius wasbound up
with theman just asisthehra.Aswith the leva,the
birthday wasparticularly setapart fortheworship of
thegenius. Subsequently, theRomans, under the
influence ofduahsm, justastheG-a-tribes have done,
divided thegenius intotwo—oneofagood disposition
andoneofabad.
Similar conceptions oftwo entities, thehra,orlife-
phantom, andthe soul, ordeath-phantom, among the
Navajo andAlgonquin Indians ofNorth America, the
Karens ofBurma, andtheTijians, werementioned in
the lastvolume,t butwhether these people believe
inmetempsychosis isuncertain ;and tothemwe
maynowadd theGreenlanders,Jandtheancient
Egyptians, whose haappears toclosely resemble the

peasants ofCounty Mayo also believe inanentity

TheYorubas, itseems probable, have arrived at
thedoctrine ofmetempsychosis after having passed
through aphase ofbelief similar tothatnowheldby
theTshi andEwe tribes. The belief inone in-
dwelling spirit hasbeenchanged intoabelief inthree
indwelling spirits, and this multiplication hascaused
confusion. These indwelling spirits donot, atthe
death ofthebody, enter anew-born human child in
thesame family, sothat thephenomena ofheredity
cannot beexplained asbeing duetotheir agency;
andtheYorubas have reverted tothetheory ofme-
tempsychosis toaccount forthem. The belief inthe
spirits called abilm isvery probably acorruption of
theformer hra belief, for ifasisa, ordisembodied
hra,enters ahuman body itcauses sickness anddeath,
justastheaUlcu does.
The souls ofthedead aresometimes reborn in
animals, andoccasionally, though butrarely, inplants.
Intheideas ofthenatives, animals, though they differmshape from aman, possess passions andmoral
qualities identical with those ofthehuman being.
Animals also possess souls which, likethesouls of
men, gotoDeadland. Hence, asmenandanimals
have somany characteristics incommon, itdoes not
require anygreat stretch ofimagination forthenative
tofancy that thesoulmaybere-born inananimal.When aplant isconcerned thedifference isgreater;
but if,aswehold, theYoruba tribes passed through a
phase ofbelief similar tothat heldbytheTshi tribes

attliepresent day,they atonetime believed that
trees, shrubs, &c.,and, infact, allthings notmade
byhuman hands, were animated bykras,which may
accoimt fortheextension ofthedoctrine ofmetem-
psychosis toobjects sounlike man.
Theanimal inwhich human souls aremost com-
monly re-born isthehyena, whose half-human laugh
mayperhaps account forthe belief. Human souls
arealsoreborn indifferent kinds ofmonkeys, but
chiefly inthesolitary yellow monkey, called oloyo;
andinthese cases thehuman appearance andcharac-
teristics ofmonkeys nodoubt furnishes thekeytothe
belief.
Ashasbeen said, there-birth ofahuman soulma
plant israrely spoken of,andusually wecandiscover
thereason forthesupposed transmigration, asinthe

«There were twoboys, brothers, whoknew and
sang thepopular songs ofthecountry sowell, that
theywere ingreatdemand forfestive occasions.

child isobvious. Itsprang from hisbones, andwas
nourished byhisdecaying body, sothat itmight well
beimagined that thesoul ofthechild, which stayed
with theremains instead ofproceeding toDeadland,
because nofuneral riteshadbeenperformed, passed
intothefungus.
Aswehave said, thesoul, orghost-man, after the
death ofthebody, proceeds toDeadland, and food,
drink, cowries, andproperty ofvarious kinds are
placed inthegrave with thecorpse, toequip the
ghost forhisnewsphere;while, before thegrave is
filled up,agoat issacrificed tothedeceased, and
wishes offered forhissafejourney, such as"Mayyou
arrive inpeace," "Mayyounotstray from theright
path," &c.
Itwould certainly appear asifthedeadwere cog-

thedeceased isexhumed andplaced inasmall temple,

field forwar, too,offerings aremade atthegraves of
warriors ofrenown, and their assistance inthecom-
ingcampaign issupplicated. Yet aproverb says,
"Asgrass cannot grow inthesky, sothedead cannot

might beinferred that thedead arenotcognizant of
what istaking place intheworld, oratallevents do
notknowwhat isoccurring till itismadeknown to
themthrough themedium ofsacrifice, and several
folk-lore tales point tothisconclusion aswell. The
following isanexample :


138 TEEYOEUBA-SPEAKING PEOPLES.
Awoman, aninliabitant ofaninland town, wlio
wasgoing totliesea-sbore tomake saltbyboiling
sea-water, acommon industry, andwlioexpected to

ofherdeparture, andinthepresence ofwitnesses, a
necklace ofvaluable beads toaneighbour, tobekept
forherduring herabsence. Theneighbour, awoman
with two boys, accepted the trust, and, for safe
custody, made ahole inthemudwall ofherhouse,
intowhich sheputthenecklace, andthen closed the
aperture with fresh mud, which shesmoothed down
toconform with thewall. Unfortunately thewoman
diedbefore theowner ofthenecklace returned, and
thesecret ofitshiding-place died with her, sothat
when theowner atlastcame back andclaimed her
property, itcould notbefound.
Thewoman made agreat commotion about the
loss. Shewould notbeheve thetwochildren when
they declared thattheyhadnotseen oreven heard
ofthenecklace, andshetookthem before the chief,
andcharged them with theft. The chief heard the
case. Thefactofthenecklace having been entrusted
tothedeceased woman wasproved;theboysdeclared
thattheyknew nothing ofit,butthechief held that
they were responsible. Iftheyhadnotstolen it
theyknew where itwas. They must restore itor

CHAPTER YIII.
MEASIJEEMENTS OETIME.
TheYorubas reckon timebymoons andweeks. A
moon, ormontb, istlieperiod oftimebetween one
newmoon and tlienext, and, asistliecase witli all
peoples wlio count bylunar months, tliedaycom-
mences atsunset, tliat isattlieliour atwMcli anew
moon would ordinarily befirstperceived.
Thecustom ofmeasuring timebylunar months
appears tobecommon toalluncivilised peoples, the
regular recurrence oftliemoon atfixed mtervals^ of
time affording anatural andeasymode ofcomputmg
itslapse. Tliemeasurement oftimebyweeks, that
isbysub-divisions ofthelunar month, seems,mthe
present state ofourknowledge ofthemodes of
measuring timeamongst thelower races, toberather
exceptional;butthesubject isonethat Jiasbeen
much neglected bytravellers, and there isbut
little information from which aconclusion maybe
drawn. ^ ^.
The Tshi-tribes oftheGold Coast have (aswas
stated inthe firstvolume ofthis series) ^^even-day
week, or,tobemore correct, theyhave divided the
lunar month, which isapproximately twenty-nme and
a-half days long, into four parts, each ofseven days


MEASUREMENTS OFTIME. 143
andabout nine hours. Hence, asbefore said,* each
weekcommences atadifferent hour oftheday,the
reason ofthisarrangement being that twenty-nine
and a-half willnotdivide exactly into halves and
quarters. The firstdayofthe firstweek ofthelunar
month commences when thenewmoon isfirstseen;
the firstdayofthesecond weekcommences some nine
hours later, andsoon.
The Ga-tribes have anexactly similar mode of
measuring time, buttheirnames forthedays ofthe
week arenotthesame asthose usedbytheTshi-
tribes. They are—
1st.Dsu. 5th. 80-ha.
2nd. Dsu-fo. 6th.Eo.
3rd. Fso. 7th.Eo-gha.
4th. ;S'o.
which, itwillbeseen,seem toconsist ofthree pairs
andanoddone,thethird day.
TheYoruba week consists offivedays, and sixofthem aresupposed tomake alunar month; but, asa
matter offact, since the firstdayofthe firstweek
always commences with theappearance ofthenew
moon, themonth really contains fiveweeks offive
days' duration, andone offour days and a-half
approximately. TheBenin-tribes totheeastaresaid
tohave asimilar method, andtheYoruba-tribes have
perhaps borrowed thefive-day week from them.
TheTshiand G-a-tribes thusaddafewhours to
eachseven-day week inorder tomake four ofthese
periods coincident with alunar month, andtheYoruba-
tribes deduct about twelve hours from thelast five-

dayweek inorder tomake sixoftliese periods agree
witli alunar montli. Thereason isobvious. Twenty-
nineand a-lialf will not divide, and the nearest
numbers that will aretwenty-eight and thn^ty. ihe
TshiandGa-tribes have adopted theformer asthe
inteo-er tobedivided, andconsequently havehad to
addsome hours, while theYorubas have adopted the
latter andhavehadtodeduct.
_
Wehave saidthat todivide thelunar month into
weeks appears tobeexceptional among thelower
races, butwehave some examples. TheAhantas
who inhabit thewestern portion oftheGold U)ast,
divide thelunarmonth intothree periods, twootten
days' duration, andthethird lasting tillthenextnew
moon appears, that is,forabout ninedaysanda-half.
TheSofalese ofEast Africa must havehadthesame
system, forDe Faria saysthattheydivided themonth
intothree weeks oftendays each,andthatthe first
day ofthe firstweek wasthe festival ofthenew
moon.* ^•ii £
When apeople hasprogressed sufficiently tarm
astronomical knowledge tohave adopted the solar
year asameasurement oftime, themonth, forthe
reason thatanexactnumber oflunar months willnot
make upasolar year, becomes acivil period or
calendar month, and isarbitrarily fixed atacertam
number ofdays, orsome months aremade ofone
len-th andsome ofanother. When this occurs, and
the°month isdisconnected from themoon and its
phases, itseems thattheweek-which wasproperly a
sub-division ofthelunar month, andwasnodoubt

designed tomark tlie cliief phases oftliemoon— also
becomes acivilperiod, and isasub-division oftliecivil
month. The ancient Greeks hadacivilmonth of
thu'tj days, divided into three weeks, each often
days; andtheJavanese, before theseven-day week
wasadopted from theMohammedans, had acivil
week offivedays.* Theformer thusresembled the
Ahantas, andthelatter theYorabas, andnodoubt
when the Gfreeks andJavanese reckoned timeby
lunar months instead ofby civil, they, like the
Ahantas andYorubas, struck offthesuperfluous hours
from thelastsub-division ofthemonth.
Thenames ofthedays oftheYoruba week areas
follows:—
1.Aho-ojo .First day.
2.Ojo-awo.Day oftheSecret (sacred toIfa).
3.Oj0-0gun .Ogun's Day.
4.Ojo-Shango. Shango's Day.
5.Ojo-Ohatala. Obatala's Day.
Aho-ojo isaSabbath, ordayofgeneral rest. Itis
considered unlucky, andnobusiness ofimportance is
everundertaken onit.Onthisday allthetemples
areswept out,andwater, fortheuseofthegods, is
brought inprocession. Each oftheother days isa

dedicated, and forthem only, Ojo-Shango being the
Sabbath oftheworshippers ofthethunder-god, and
Ojo-Ogun forthose ofthegodofiron, butAJco-Ojo isa

Oseliascome also tomean theweek offivedays, or
theperiod intervening between twoholy days.
There appears tobegood reason forsupposing that
the institution ofageneral day ofrest, notonly
among- theYorubas, but inmost, ifnot all,other
cases,maybereferred tomoon-worship. The first
dayofthefirstweek ofthelunar month isreckoned
from theappearance ofthenewmoon, andwas,we
think, amoon-festival, orholyday sacred tothe
moon. Thisholy day,before theinvention ofweeks,
recurred monthly, butafter thelunarmonth wassub-
divided, itrecurred weekly, andwasheldonthe first
day oftheweek. TheMendis oftheliinterland of
Sierra Leone, whoreckon timebylunar months, but
have notdivided themonth intoweeks, hold, anew-
moon festival, andabstain from allwork onthedayof
thenewmoon, alleging that ifthey infringed this
rulecornand ricewould grow red,thenewmoon
being a"dayofblood." From thiswemayperhaps
infer that itwasatonetimecustomary toofferhuman
sacrifices tothenewmoon. TheBechuanas ofSouth
Africa keep thetwenty-four hours, from theevening
onwhich thenewmoon appears tillthenext evening,
asaday ofrest, and refrain from going totheir
gardens.* These areexamples ofmonthly moon-
Sabbaths observed bypeoples who donotreckon by
weeks.
The firstday oftheTshi week, which inthe first
week ofthelunarmonth isthedayofthenewmoon,
iscalled Byo-da {Adjwo-da) "Day ofRest," and isa
*Livingstonp, "Travels inSoutli Africa," p235.


MEASUltEMENTS OFTIME. U7
general dajofrest. Theother days oftheweek are,
aswith theYorubas, dajs ofrest also,butonly for
particular persons, andnotforthewhole community.
Thesecond day, Bna-cla, issacred tothesea-gods,
and isthefisherman's Sabbath ;while the fifth day,'
Fi-da, istheSabbath ofagriculturists. The firstday
oftheG-aweek, which isalsoageneral day ofrest,
iscalled Dsu, "Purification." Dsiiseems also tohave
been used asatitle ofthemoon, forwefind silver
called dsu-etei, "moon substance," or"moonstone,"
and inthecognate EweandYoruba languages, the
moon iscalled Dsu-nu andOshu respectively. Owing
tolater andmore anthropomorphic conceptions of
godsmoon-worship appears tohave died out,though
allthese peoples salute thenewmoon respectfully
when itisfirst seen,andaTshi epithet ofthemoon
isholmim, "Sacred," or"God." When, however,
moon-worship flourished, themoon would undoubt-
edlyhavebeen ageneral god,worshipped bythecom-
munity asawhole; andhence thedaydedicated tothe
moon isageneral dayofrest,and not, liketheother
days oftheweek, aday ofrest forcertain persons
only. Inthecase oftheTshiandGatribes, wethus
have examples ofaweekly moon- Sabbath, observed
bypeoples whoreckon byweeks.
Itseems probable thattheJewish Sabbath wasalso
connected primarily withmoon-worship, and atfirst
was amonthly festival likethat oftheMendis and
Bechuanas, butbecame aweekly festival after the
Jews adopted theseven-day week from theBaby-
lonians. Inthehistorical books oftheOld Testa-
ment, viz.,Joshua, Judges, thebooks ofSamuel, and

thefirstbook ofKings, tliere isnotonlynomention
ofaweekly Sabbatk, whicli isfirst spoken ofm
II.Kings iv.23,butthere isevidence tliat sucli an
institution wasunknown; for tlieencompassing of
Jericho,* theevents described inI.Samuel xxix. and
XXX., andSolomon's fourteen-day feast,t would all
have violated theinjunction,"Letnomangooutof
hisplace ontheseventh day,"t hadthere been a
weekly Sabbath. Butwhile theweekly Sabbath is
notmentioned wefindanewmoon festival spoken
of.§ Inallthe later works, written after contact
with theBabylonians, wefindfrequent mention of
Sabbaths, butnearly always inconnection withnew
moons, andtheday ofthenewmoon was itself
observed asaday ofrest, orSabbath.||That the
Jewish Sabbath should come tobecalled theseventh
day,though originally thedayofthenewmoon, and
consequently the firstdayofthelunar month, canbe
readily understood. When aholydayrecurs every
seventh day,thedayonwhich itisheld isnaturally
called theseventh day. Thus thedayoftheYoruba
Sabbath, which recurs every fifth day, iscalled the
fifth day oftheweek, though themeaning ofthe
name alco-ojo isfirst day.
That, onadaydedicated toagod,nomanner of
work should bedonebythefollowers ofthat god,
seems tobeacustom ofuniversal appHcation. Ab-
stention fromworkwasdoubtless considered amode

ofsliowing respect for tliegod,and since awant of
respect foragodwould becommonly belie'/ed tobe
followed bjsome punishment inflicted byhim, the
proposition that itisunlucky todowork onaholy
daynaturally becomes accepted. Thus theYorubas
consider itunlucky foranyone towork onthe aJco-ojo,
orgeneral Sabbath, andforthefollowers ofthegods
towhom theother days arededicated towork on
those days. Forafollower ofagod toviolate the
daysacred tothatgod isasserious offence among the
Tshi, Ga,Ewe, andYoruba tribes, astobreak the
Sabbath wasamong theJews;and, aswith theJews,
ISpunished with death, thenotion being that ifthe
honour ofthegod isnotvindicated byhisfollowers,
they will suffer fortheneglect. TheSabbath-breaker
IS,mfact, killed bytheother worshippers ofthegod
from motives ofself-protection. OntheGold Coast
anyfisherman whodared toputtoseaonBna-da, the
fisherman's Sabbath, would inevitably, intheolddays,
havebeenputtodeath. Persons whowere not fish-
ermen, andwho consequently were notfollowers of
thegods ofthesea,might doasthey pleased ;forin
that spirit oftoleration which always accompanies
polytheism, theywere held tobeonlyaccountable to
theirowngods.
Among theYoruba tribes markets areheld weekly,
that is,every fifth day. Thedayofthemarket variesmdifferent townships, but itisnever heldonthe aJco-
ojo.From thiscustom ofholding markets every fifth
dayhas arisen another mode ofcomputing time,
namely, byperiods ofseventeen days, called eta-di-

tlieEm societies, orsubscription clubs, wMcli are
general amongst theYoruba tribes, and still exist,
under thesame name, among thenegroes ofYoruba

The fifth market-day, onwhich themembers meet
