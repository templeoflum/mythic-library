CHAPTER XV.
CONCLUSIONS.
Inthepreface tothesecond volume oftliis series it
was said tliat, incollecting information concerning
therehgions ofthecognate tribes dealt with,mj
chief purpose wastoendeavour toascertain towhat
extent different conditions ofculture led tothe
modifications ofreligious conceptions. Three groups
oftribes havenowbeen considered, theTshi, the
Ewe, andtheToruba, whorepresent three stages of
progress, theTshi being inthelowest stage andthe
Yoruba inthehighest. Asthese tribal groups un-
doubtedly hadacommon origin, itisreasonable to
suppose thattheYoruba tribes were once inthesocial
andmental condition inwhich theTshi tribes are
now,and that, infact, inthese groups wefindthe
same race indifferent states ofculture. Assuming
then, aswelegitimately may, thatthereligious beliefs
oftheEwes aremodifications ofearlier belief re-
sembling those now.heldbytheTshis, andthatthose
oftheYorubas aresimilarly modifications ofbeliefs
likethosenowheld bytheEwes, weherehave an
opportunity ofobserving howtheevolution ofreligion
mayproceed.
Among theTshi-speaking tribes wefound that

everytliing innature isbelieved tobeanimated—that
istosay,everything notmade byhmnan hands has
ananimating principle, spiritual second-self, or
indwelling spirit, possessing powers which maybe
beneficial orprejudicial toman, according towhether
itispropitiated orneglected. Itseems probable that
thebelief inallnature being thusanimated wasan
extension ofthebelief thatman possesses aspiritual
second-self, orindwelling spirit, which belief is
beyond dispute the result ofsavage speculation
concerning dreams. Man, having decided that he
possessed anindwelling spirit, would extend thesame
possession toanimals, then tovegetable life,and
finally toinanimate nature, partly because hedoes
notperceive any strict line ofdemarcation between
these, andpartly because heasfrequently seesthe
phantoms ofsuch things inhisdreams ashedoesthe
phantoms ofliving meu. Hewould beledtoextend
theindwelling-spirit theory toallnature, because it
would account formany things thatwould otherwise
beincomprehensible, since uncivilised man believes
thatevery occurrence istheresult ofdesign, andthat
nothing everhappens byaccident. Thetheory that
amanwho isdrowned hasbeendrawn down and
strangled bythe water-spirit, seems tohimmuch
more satisfactory than tosuppose that thedeath was
theresult ofchance circumstances.
Allindwelling spirits are,however, notequally
revered. Those ofbushes, grasses, stones, &c., are
notmuch regarded, andthemost important arethose
ofrivers, lagoons, the sea,mountains, rocks, and
shoals. Thereason ofthis,nodoubt, isthatnoloss

and those natural features and objects which

tothem, orrather totheir animating principles, than
those which have proved tobeinnocuous. Every

worships thespirit ofthestream that flows near his
dwelling, orthat ofthe cliff ormass ofrockwhich
overhangs hisplantation, andthose ofthegigantic
silk-cotton trees, whose downfall sofrequently crushes
todeath theinhabitant ofthe forest. Objects of

and sacrifice aremade inthehabitat ofthespirit, or

formed before it,instead of,asheretofore, atthe cliff.
Thegod,however, isnotsupposed tohave absolutely
abandoned the cliff,andpersons whose avocations
tookthem toitwould stillthink itnecessary topro-
pitiate himwith small offerings offood. Practically
heisbelieved tobeinthe cliffandyetalsointhe

that theimage merely served asaninstrument

orlater, theconnection oftliegodwith the cliff, of
which hewastheanimating principle, iscompletely
lostsight of,andheisregarded asthetutelary deity
ofthe village, pure and simple. Inthisway un-
doubtedly originated many ofthetutelary deities of
towns andvillages ontheGrold Coast, fortheprocess

ing italittle further, tribal ornational godsmight be
similarly produced, but,withtwo orthree exceptions,
theTshi tribes havenotprogressed sofarasthat,and
most ofthegods worshipped bycomplete tribes are
simply theindwelling spirits ofvery remarkable
natural objects situated intheterritories occupied by
thetribes.
Besides thegodswhich aretheanimating principles
orindwelling spirits ofnatural features and objects,
andwhich wemay callnature-gods, wehave objects
ofworship ofanother class, which aretheproduct of
manes-worship, andwhich wemay therefore term
ghost-gods. The ghosts, orsouls ofdeceased men
ofrankandpower, aresupplicated andpropitiated
inthesamewayand tothesame extent asarethe
nature-gods, and itisoften difl&cult todecide where
theoneworship begins andtheother ends.
Manes-worship reaches itsfullest development in
theroyal houses ofAshanti andDahomi, that isto
say,inthose situations where theconditions aremost
favourable forpreserving thememory ofthewisdom
andpower ofdeceased men. Inboth these houses
periodical human sacrifices aremade onthetombs
oftheformer kings, inaddition tothedaily minor
offerings offood and drink. We find thesame

confusion between objective andsubjective connection
intliecase ofthese gliost-gods aswedointhat of
thenature-gods ;andtheskulls ofchiefs andothers
areoften exhumed andplaced insmall temples
adjoining thedwelling-houses, intheidea that the
guardian-ghost isthereby brought tothespot. At
thebattle ofDodowah, nearAccra, where theAshantis
were defeated in1826, ahead, wrapped inasilk

emblem ofroyalty, wascaptured. Thiswasthehead

king against hisenemies. Before thebattle offerings
weremade toit,andtheghost wasinvoked tocause
theheads ofallthewhitemen inthe field tolie

Many tutelary deities oftowns, clans, andfamilies
doubtless owe their origin tomanes-worship. The
dead areordinarily, onemight almost sayinvariably,
buried inornear tothehabitations oftheliving, and
itiscertain that inmany cases thehabit ofoffering
sacrifices attheplace ofsepulture hasbeen continued,
simply through habit, long after thefactthataman
was buried there hasbeen forgotten. Insuch a
case, theguardian-ghost being lostsight of,thegod
issimply atutelary god,whose origin iseither unex-
plained, orwhich thepriests explain inanywaythat
may suitthem best. "Wethushavetwoexplanations

forgotten. Ofcourse tliemanes tliemselves are
tutelar.
Nature-gods tliemselves arenodoubt inseveral
cases blended with ghost-gods. The reverence paid
tocertain rivers, rocks, cliffs, &c.,musthave often
dated fromsome fatal accident thatoccurred incon-
nection withthem. Itwas thiswhich first attracted
attention, andprimitive manwould notbelikely todis-
criminate between theghost ofthevictim, which would
haunt thespotwhere thelatter lost his life,andthe
indwelling spirit ofthenatural feature. Neverthe-
less,thatthenature-gods are,asawhole, theproduct
ofmanes-worship, is,wethink, atheory notwar-
ranted bytheevidence, though apparently supported
bythehigh authority ofMr.Herbert Spencer. It
often occurs that afamily settles near tosome river,
lake, orhill,andforthwith commences acult ofthe
indwelling spirit, without any catastrophe having
taken place toinitiate it.Infact, itmaybesaid to
betherulethatwhenever aTshigroup takes upits
abode nearanyremarkable natural feature orobject,
itworships and seeks topropitiate itsindwelling
spirit, fearing that otherwise itmay dosomeharm.
Many ofthenature-gods arenon-terrestrial, and it
isdifficult toseebywhat process they could ever
become confused with dead men. Nobody could be
buried inthesky,sun,moon, rainbow, orwind ;and
ifthese could beconceived tobeanimated without
theintervention ofthesouls ofthedead,whycould
notterrestrial objects also? Manes-worship istheresult
ofthebelief thatmanhasanindwelling spiritwhich sur-
vives after thedeath ofthebody, andnature-worship


G0NGLU8I0NS. 283
istheresult ofthebelief that allnature isanimated.
Which was first inorder itwould bedifficult todeter-
mine with absolute certainty, but,from theanalogy of
thelower animals, itseems probable that thesecond
was. Animals regard objects which move asalive,
without having come totheconclusion that they
themselves have spiritual second selves, andprimitive
man,whowould know littlemore ofnatural causation
thanananimal does, probably didalso.When arock
slipped, oratree fell,theunusual behaviour suggested
animation. Afterwards, when hehadcome tobelieve
thathehimself possessed anindwelling spirit, he
probably conceived theanimating entities ofnatural
objects to'besomewhat analogous, andmade thegods
thereflex ofhisown kra.
Objects madebyhuman hands arenotanimate, and
donotpossess indwelling spirits, though theyhave
ghosts, which thesouls ofthedead areable tomake
use ofindeadland. There are,however, many such
objects uponwhich thenative setsgreat value, andas
theydonotpossess guardian-spirits ofthemselves, he
provides them with artificial ones. Thus, justashe
kills thewives ofhischief, and buries them with
him, releasing their ghosts, orsouls, from their bodies
toenable them tocontinue their ministrations totheir
lord, so,perfectly logically, heslays aslave onthe
family stool, theemblem ofoffice, orupon thegreat
drum ofthetribe, releasing theghost from thebody
inorder toenable ittobecome theguardian-spirit of
thestool ordrum. This isaluxury thatcanonlybe
afforded bymen ofrank, ortoensure the safe-
keeping ofnational trophies oremblems, andhence

itisonly tlieroyal stools ofkings and chiefs, orpara-
pliernalia belonging totlietribe asawliole, tliat are,
asarule, thus protected. Thevictim isdecapitated
upon theobject sothattheblood gushes over it,and
ontheGold Coastmany tribal stools anddrums are
clotted thick with theblood ofthosewhohavebeen
slainupon them, for itseems tobethought necessary
torenew theguardian from time totime. As,when
ahuman sacrifice isoffered toagod,thevictim is
similarly slainupon thesacred stool orchair, itseems
probable thattheghost isinthiscase alsobelieved to
become aguardian-spirit. Nodoubt thebelief that
allobjects notmade byhuman hands possessed in-
dwelling, orguardian- spirits, suggested theidea of
supplying artificial guardian-spirits toobjects which
didnotcome under this category. The practice is
very widespread, and thecustom ofimmolating
human victims atthelaunching ofwar-cauoes in
theislands ofthe Pacific, sothat thebows were
sprinkled with their blood, andtheDyak practice of
crushing aslave-girl todeath under the first post
erected atthebuilding ofacommunal house, arecases
inpoint, thesacrifice being ineach case designed to
provide aguardian-spirit.
With some two orthree exceptions, allthegods
worshipped bytheTshi tribes arepurely local and
have ahmited area ofworship. Ifthey arenature-

Theindwelling spirits ofnatural objects areheld to
beofhuman shajDe, buttopossess themore striking-
characteristics oftheobjects they animate. Thus,
because thesilk-cotton treehasagaunt, greyish- white
trunk, which towers high above theother trees ofthe
forest, andoften reaches toaheight of100feetbefore
itthrows outabranch, Srahmantin issaid tobeof
gigantic stature and greyish-white incolour. To
these characteristics native imagination hasadded
long flowing hair, and long pendent breasts.

general gods,many ofwbicli liavenownoconnection

currently with theincrease inthenumber oftribal
andgeneral gods runs therelegation ofthepurely
localgods toaninferior position. Agodwho iswor-
shipped overalarge area isnaturally believed tobe
more powerful than onewhose area ofworship is
circumscribed, andthetribal andgeneral gods, having
each their special functions andattributes, monopolise
between them nearly allthephenomena andqualities
which excite fearandrespect inman. The localgods
arethuspushed back from theprominent position
theyheldamong theTshi tribes, withwhom topro-
pitiate thelocalgodwasconsidered allimportant,
andthough they areworshipped bysmall communities
andsolitary families, theinhabitants oftowns donot
paymuch attention tothem. Almost every person is
enrolled asafollower ofone, atleast, ofthegeneral
and tribal gods, andwhen aman issecure ofthe
favour andprotection oftheking, thegoodwill of

mena areattributed toanewconception, Khebioso, a

andSapatan, thesmall-pox god. Inthis deification,

bytheghost-gods, who, astheforefathers ofthe
living, arebelieved totakeaninterest inthepropa-
gation oftheir descendants, though occasionally the
exciting ofthispassion maybefound tobeoneout
ofthemany attributes ofanature-god.

over thepassion oflove. Orisha Oko,who repre-
sents natural fertility, AjeShaluga, god ofwealth,
Shigidi, personified nightmare, andDada, patron of
vegetables, arenew conceptions. Anative ofthe

considered duototheefforts ofhistutelary deity, but

Theevolution oftypes hasbeen carried further
thanamong theEwes, andinstead ofeach hilland
mountain having itsownindwelling godwehaveOke,
god ofheights ingeneral ;while inplace ofthe
multitude oflocal sea-gods found ontheGold Coast
andthewestern half oftheSlave Coast, wehave one

forests, isanother example. Olosa, the lagoon,
Oya, theriver Niger, andthetwo rivers Oshun and

doubt wasOsanbin, god ofmedicine. Ogun, god of
iron, andbence ofwar,maybeapersonification of
iron, but itisjust asprobable thathewasthetradi-
tional discoverer oftheuseofiron,andhence aghost-
god,whohasnowbeen raised tothe first rank. In
thegeneral tendency toregard Legba asthe evil
principle, weperhaps seeafirst steptowards dualism,
inwhich Ifa, forchoice, would represent thegood
principle. Allthegods aremore anthropomorphic
thanwasthecasewith theEweandTshi tribes.
Looking, then, atthese three groups oftribes, we
findwhat seems tobearegular progression from the
gods ofhamlets andsmall communities, asamong the
Tshis, tothegods ofawhole people, asamong the
Yorubas; andfrom theworship ofthe indwelling-
spirits oftangible objects, orobjects believed tobe
tangible, asthesky,and ofdeadmen, totheworship
ofpersonified principles. With theaggregation of
peoples comes theconcretion ofgods. Onthe Grold
Coast thenatives dwell insmall groups, isolated from
oneanother bylarge tracts offorest. There areno
towns, properly speaking, except onthesea-coast, and
only afewlarge villages. Ideas percolate butslowly,
andpeople liveinthenarrow circle oftheirown lives,
knowing little ornothing ofanything that transpires
outside their own hamlet. Tothem theirown
surroundings areofthefirstimportance, andthelocal

room here forthegrowth ofnational andgeneral

gods, foreverything isnarrowed down tothevillage
circle.
Among thoseEwe tribeswho inhabit thewestern
andforested portion oftheSlave Coastwefindmuch
thesame condition ofaffairs ;but inthe eastern
Ewe districts thecountry iscomparatively open,
communities arelarger, andcommunication isinevery
way freer. Here ideas circulate readily, man is
constantly meeting with man, and ashismental
circle widens, sodohisconceptions concerning the
nature ofgods. Thus,among theeastern Ewe tribes
wefindmany national and tribal gods, andseveral
general gods, while thelocal gods have sunk inthe
general estimation.
Among theYoruba tribes thisevolution hasbeen
carried stillfurther, thecountry, except thatinhabited
bytheJebus, being fairly open, largetowns numerous,
and circulation constant. Here the localgodhas
almost disappeared, andthegreat majority ofthe
gods areknown to,andworshipped by,thewhole of
the tribes. The origin andinception ofthenature-
gods, astheindwelling spirits ofnatural objects or
phenomena, being generally lost sight of,some
explanation oftheir existence becomes necessary,
and, inconsequence, wefind avariety ofmyths
dealing with theparentage andadventures ofthe
gods.
Asfarasmanes-worship alone isconcerned—that
is,theworship ofspirits orgodswhich areknown to
have once beenmen—there isnogreat difference
between the three lingual groups. Among the
Yorubas itis,ifanything, rather lessdeveloped than

among tlieTsliis andEwes, orratlier relegated toan
inferior position, inconsequence oftliegreater power
andsway oftiiegods generally worshipped. When-
ever, however, thehuman origin oftheghost-god
hasbeen lostsight of,heseems tohave conformed
tothegeneral rule ;that is,where thecircumstances
have been unfavourable, hehas, liketheminor local
nature-gods, disappeared, orbeen absorbed inthe
personality ofanother god,andwhere theyhavebeen
favourable, hehasacquired increased renoAvn and
area ofworship, andbecome anational orgeneral god.
That with thenationalisation ofgods thepriest-
hood should alsobecome organised anddeveloped is
anatural result. Both ontheG-oldandSlave Coasts,
and, indeed, everywhere else, thepriesthood isa
guild, orfraternity, themembers ofwhich require a
special knowledge ;andnoman orwoman canbecome
amember ofitwithout apreliminary training, or
apprenticeship. OntheGrold Coast, however, there
arenodistinct orders, orbodies, ofpriests. Thegods
being infinite innumber, and local, thegroups of
priests are infinite innumber, and local, andhave
nocohesion. Inevery village there willbefound
three orfour priests whoknow thesacred dances and
special ceremonies required fortheworship ofthe
gods peculiar tothat village, buttheyknow nothing
ofthe rites andceremonies ofthegods ofother
towns. OntheSlave Coast, ontheother hand, each
general god oftheEwe tribes, except Mawu, hasin
every town and village aconsiderable number of
priests, whose duty itistominister tohimand to
him alone. Colleges andseminaries fortheinstruc-

tion ofnovices arenumerous, and toeachgodare
attached anumber oftemple-women, orwives.
Among theYoruba tribes priestlj organisation is
carried still further, andthere arethree recognised
orders ofpriests, each ofwhich issubdivided into
grades. OntheGrold Coast apriest might officiate
indifferently before anygod ofthelocality forwhich
hewas, sotospeak, ordained ;but ifaYoruba priest
ofShango were toattempt toconsult Ifatherewould
beasgreat acommotion astherewould beifaRoman
Catholic priest were toattempt topreach inaBaptist
Chapel. There is,infact, ahealthy competition
between thepriests oftheprincipal gods, andeach
guard theirown privileges very jealously.
Religion, atthestage ofgrowth inwhich wefind
itamong these three groups oftribes, hasnoconnec-
tionwith morals, orthe relations ofmen toone
another. Itconsists solely ofceremonial worship, and
thegods areonlyoffended whensome riteorceremony
hasbeen neglected oromitted. Iftheomission be
quite unintentional theresult isjustthesame, asthe

revenges thatwhich affects himself. With thewrongs
ofothers hehasnothing todo. Ifamanmurdered

crime. Onthe otlier hand, years ofblameless life
would notsave amanfrompunishment ifheomitted
some customary rite, orinadvertently gave offence.
Similarlv, intheHebrew books, wefind that the
detestable fraud perpetrated byJacob upon his
brother Esau didnotinanywaylessen thefavour
withwhich hewasregarded bythenational god;but
when theunfortunate TJzzah, with thebest intentions
intheworld, putforth hishand andheld thearkto
keep itfrom falling, hewasstruck dead, because the
action implied that thegodwasnotable toprotect
himself. So, too,among theancient Greeks, the
godstooknocognisance ofsocial offences, andonly
revenged slights offered tothemselves;as,when they
caused Protesilaus, thehusband ofLaodamia, tobe
the firsthero slain before Troy, because she,inher
eagerness toconsummate hermarriage, forgot to
propitiate them with theusual sacrifices.
The belief that religion hasnoconnection with
morals thusseems tobeinherent inmanwhen ina
certain intellectual and social condition, and itisnot
byanymeans atonce gotridofbytheadoption of
thereligion ofahigher race inwhich thetwo are
associated. Theuneducated negroes ofourcolonies,
forinstance, whohave been nominally Christian for
some three generations, practically believe that the
commission ofgrave moral offences, andeven crimes,
willnotintheleast affect their prospects offuture
"salvation," provided that they gotochurch or
chapel regularly, and, infact,paytheir god allthat
ceremonial homage and lip-service which is,intheir
yiew, theessence ofreligion.

On tlieGold and Slave Coasts tliere isperfect
liberty ofthouglit inmatters ofreligion, butaman
mustshowoutward respect forthegods, because to
dootherwise istoprovoke calamities. Amanmay
worship many gods, ornone, just ashepleases, but
hemust notinsult any. Infact, atthis stage,man
tolerates anyform ofreligion that tolerates others;
and ashethinks itperfectly natural that different
people should worship different gods, hedoes not
attempt toforce hisownpersonal opinions upon any-
one,ortoestablish conformity ofideas.
Thestriking resemblance which theYoruba religious
system bears tothat oftheancient Greeks can
scarcely have escaped notice. Olorun, thesky-god
proper, nowbeing gradually displaced bythemore
anthropomorphic Obatala, resembles Uranus, whowas
displaced byKronos. InGreek mythology Kronos
married hissister Ehea, theearth, andtheYoruba
myth, makes Obatala marry Odudua, who alsorepre-
sents theearth, though thequalities ofAphrodite
appear topredominate. Olokun answers toPoseidon,
Ogim, worker iniron, toHephoestus, Orisha Oko to
Priapus, Osanhin to^sklepius, Orun, thesun, to
Helios, andOshu, themoon, toSelene. Zeus' mes-
senger, Hermes, thelightning, wastheprotector of
plunderers, andShango isthegodoflightning and
plunder. Ifa,asthegodofprophecy, andthebeing
whowards offevilandaffords help, resembles Apollo,
who, inHomer, isperfectly distinct from thesun-god,
though identified withhiminlater times.*
*IntheSoman mythology Airmarried Earth, andthemarriage
wasrenewed every year inspring. (Virgil, Gcorg. ii.,32.5.) Here,
Air(Orungan) marries Water (Yemaja).

The spirits oftlietreesanswer totheHama- dryads,
andwehave river-gods and sea-spirits. Metamor-
phosis toabrook, spring, orlagoon iscommon, and
wehaveoneexample ofagirlbeing transformed, like
Daphne, into ashrub. The gods,when consulted,
gave oracular responses that differ innoessential
particular from theanswers given bytheOracle of
Delphi. TheYorubas, liketheG-reeks, offerhuman
sacrifices intime ofnational need. Dancing was,
with theGreeks, intimately connected with wor-
ship, asLucian says :*"You cannot find a
single ancient mystery inwhich there isnot
dancing;" and onthe Grold and Slave Coasts
every god ofnote has hisown dance, which
issacred tohim, andknown only tothe
initiated. The religion ofancient Grreece hasbeen
obscured byagreat deal oflater poetic imagery;
but,whenwelook into itclosely, itisfound tobe
similar tothat oftheYorubas, andwasnodoubt
produced when theG-reeks were inalikeintellectual
condition. Itisapantheon which seems peculiar to
acertain stage ofculture, and iscomposed ofnat'ire-
gods and ghost-gods. TheKhonds ofIndia have
almost exactly thesame objects ofworship asthe
Yorubas, their gods being thesun-god, moon-god,
earth-god, godofironandarms, small-jDox-god, god
ofhills, god ofstreams, forest-god, god oflimits,
god offountains, god ofrain,god ofhunting, god
ofbirths, village-god, andtank-god. fSimilar resem-
blances areforthcoming from almost every part of

theworld. Infact, tliegods areeverywhere much
thesame, because much thesame phenomena and
natural objects arefound everywhere, andbecause
mankind onthesame plane ofcivilisation hasmuch
thesamewants andnecessities.
From acomparison ofthesystems ofconsanguinity
ofthese lingual groups weareable totrace theorder
ofevolution ofthefamily, andtheresults gotoshow
thatDr.Starcke's* theories ofthepriority ofasys-
tem ofkinship through fathers areincorrect, and
thatMr.McLennan was right inhisgeneral conclu-
sions that descent through mothers was first in
order.
Among theTshi tribes oftheGold Coast descent
issolely andexclusively inthefemale line.Afamily
isanumber ofpersons connected byuterine ties,
allofwhom bear thesame clan-name. The clan-
name isthetest ofkinship, andafamily isasmall
circle ofpersons whose exact degrees ofconsanguinity
toeach other areknown, within thewider circle of
more distant relations, that is,theclan atlarge.
Marriage within theclan isforbidden, andhence a
father cannot berelated byblood tohischildren, or
beofthesame family. Succession toproperty, office,
ordignity follows the line ofblood-descent, anda
man's heir ishisbrother, or,failing abrother, his
sister's son.
Among theGatribes oftheGold Coast descent is
also solely andexclusively inthefemale line,and
marriage inthemother's family isforbidden; but

liasbegun toassert itself, and insome cases, cMeflj
where thefather isaman ofsome rankandpower,
office ordignity descends from father toson. Pro-
perty isstill considered tobevested infamilies,
rather than inindividuals, andsuccession toproperty
remains inthefemale line, inthesame order as
among theTshi tribes.
Among thewestern Ewe tribes thelawofblood-
descent, andofsuccession tooffice orproperty, isthe
same aswith theGatribes ;butamong theeastern
Ewe tribes, inDahomi, blood-descent isonboth sides
ofthehouse, andsuccession inthemale line. This
change has,however, onlytaken place intheroyal
family ofDahomi, andamong whatmaybetermed
the aristocracy, who appear tohave followed the
lead oftheir sovereign. Thelower orders still trace
descent inthefemale line,andthatthehigher orders
used also todosoisshown bytheterms inusefor
expressing relationships. Brother and sister, for
instance, canonly berendered by"mother's son"
and"mother's daughter"respectively.
Among theYoruba tribes descent isthrough both
parents with succession inthemale line,andmarriage
isforbidden both inthefather's andmother's family
solong asrelationship canbetraced. Aman's heirs
arehissons,among whom theproperty isequally
divided. Ifamanhavenosons, hisbrothers inherit.
Theoldideas concerning blood-descent still,however,
exercise some influence, andchildren bythesame
father, butdifferent mothers, arenotgenerally con-
sidered proper blood-relations. Thus, going from
theTshi tribes totheYoruba, from theleast cultured


CONGLUSTONS. 299
totliemost cnltnred, wefind agradual butregular
change from kinship and descent through mothers
onlj, tokinship anddescent through both parents.
Wearealso able totrace theevolution ofsociety
from thestage inwhich thegroup, orcommunity, as
awhole, protected itsownrights andexacted redress
forinjuries, tothat inwhich thestate protects the
individual andpunishes crime.
Itwould appear that, atfirst, thecommunity or
group wasthe social unit,andhad collective rights
and responsibilities, every member ofthegroup
having aright totheprotection ofthegroup asa
whole, andbeing inturn responsible individually for
theacts oromissions ofthegroup asawhole, or
ofanymember ofit. Ifwemight speculate onthis
subject wemight saythat thiscondition dated from
thetimewhen thegroup washomogeneous, andhad
notyetbeen broken upinto different clans bythe
system ofblood-descent through mothers. Either no
notion ofblood-descent atallhadbeen formed, or,if
formed, thegroup-tie, the tieofassociation and
comradeship, wasconsidered ofmoremoment than
theblood-tie. The soleremaining trace ofthis con-
dition tobefound among thethree lingual groups
under consideration liesintherightwhich acreditor,
whose debtor belongs toanother community, hasto
seize theproperty ofathird party, belonging tothe
same community astheperson indebted, instead of
recovering what isduefrom thelatter. ThegroujD is
individually and collectively responsible fordebts
contracted byanymember.

connected byuterine ties, istliesocial unit,and eacli
member ofafamily isindividually responsible forall
theothers. The state, represented bythetribal or
village-chief, takes nocognisance ofoffences unless
they aresuch asdirectly concern, orarebelieved to
concern, theinterests ofthecommunity asawhole.
Treason andwitchcraft arealmost theonly offences
that the state takes cognisance of.Incases of
homicide, theft, rape, assault, and injury tothe
person orproperty, itisthefamily oftheperson
whohassuffered that alone candemand andexact
satisfaction. Noone elsehasaright tointerfere,
and, ifthefamily should choose toforego all
demands, noonehas aright tosay anything.
Reparation isnotsought directly from theoffender,
butfrom thefamily towhich hebelongs. Itis,in
fact, acase ofonefamily arrayed against another.
Where thecontending parties cannot come to
mutual agreement astothereparation, theinjured
party brings thecase before the state, that is,the
chief, who, until thus called upon toarbitrate, has
nopower toact. There isnofixed scale ofpunish-
ments orawards ;theinjured family assesses its
damages, and, iftheinjuring family does notaccept
theterms oreffect acompromise, thedispute is
referred tothechief forsettlement. Murder isnot
necessarily punished with death, forthefamily of
thedeceased may, iftheythink fit,accept amoney-
compensation inlieuforthelossoftheservices ofthe
deceased. Ifthefamily bepoor, andthat ofthe
murderer rich,they usually deem itbetter toexact
payment than toenjoy theluxury ofrevenge, which

would onlyhave theeffect ofclejDriving theinjurers
ofone oftheir number, without improving the
position oftheinjured. Inthecontrary case the
feeling ofrevenge isalloAved tohave itsway ;and
when this occurs, thehomicide ishanded over to
theinjured family andputtodeath bythem. In
cases oftheft, orinjury toproperty, thestolen goods
arereturned, ortheamount ofthedamage made
good, bythefamily towhich theoffender belongs;
which isalso liable toafinefornothaving controlled
theactions oftheguilty member. Thefamily itself
then deals with itserring member, andpunishes or
pardons him, justasitthinks fit,thatbeing amatter
with which theoutside public hasnothing todo.
'Nodistinction ismade between crimes andaccidents.
Motive isnever taken into account, andtheharm
done isalways deliberated upon from thepoint of
view ofloss tothefamily. Ifamanbedeliberately
murdered, orkilled byaccident, there isequally a
loss ofanindividual tothefamily, andthey canin
either casetake alifeinexchange, oraccept com-
pensation. "Wesawthereflex ofthiscondition in
their religious views, thegodsbeing likewise believed
nottotakemotive intoconsideration.
Among theYorubas, inconsequence ofthechange
inthesystem ofblood-descents, thefamily haslost
cohesion. Itisnolonger thepowerful organisation it
waswhen itrested upon thebasis oftheclan;for,
instead ofbeing alarge group ofkindred, ithasbe-
come acongeries ofhouseholds, eachwithtwo lines

takes cognisance ofserious crimes, andonlyminor
injuries totlieperson orproperty are left totlie
initiative ofthefamily. Therestoration ofthestolen
property, andtheimposition ofafineonthefamily, is
nolonger considered asufficient reparation fortheft.
Theft hascome toberegarded asanoffence against
social order, inwhich thewhole community is
interested, andhence afirst offence ispunished by
flogging orfine, asecond bymutilation, andathirdby
death. The family, being nolonger collectively
responsible fortheactions ofitsseveral members, is
notallowed todealwiththeguiltymember asitthinks
fit.The statemetes outjustice;everyman isrespon-
sible forhisownconduct, andpunishment fallsupon
theguilty individual instead ofupon thegroup of
kindred.
Wearealsoable totrace tosome extent theevolu-
tion ofideas concerning property. Inthose groups of
tribes which trace descent through mothers only,
property isvested infamilies rather tha,n inindi-
viduals. There is,ofcourse, individual property, but
itusually islimited tominor articles, such asutensils,
weapons, &c. Houses, thefamily gold ornaments,
insignia, stools, andproperties thathavebeenhanded
down frombygone generations, arevested inthehead
ofthefamily, andcannot bealienated without thecon-
sent ofthefamily asawhole. Atthedemise ofthe
head ofthefamily thenext ofkinwhosucceeds has
theusufruct ofthefamily property inhisturn,and is
responsible foritssafecustody. Among theYorubas,
inconsequence ofthechange inthesystem ofdescents,

group ofkindred, and isdivided among theheirs,who
arethesons, or,indefault ofsons, brothers. Ashere,
equally with thetribeswho trace descent solely inthe
female line, theorder ofsuccession isunalterable;
property inallcases remains inthefamily, theonly
difference being thatamong theYorubas itisdis-
tributed with each succeeding generation, instead of
being kept together ;butthetendency oftheYoruba
custom undoubtedly istodestroy thenotion that
property belongs tothegroup ofkindred, andtomake
itindividual.
Inthecase ofallthetribes land isheld incommon,
andthere isnoindividual property inland,though
thenotion thatland canbetheproperty oftheindi-
vidual, instead ofthecommunity, has,ashasbeen said,
begun toappear among theYorubas. Probably, in
early times, moveable aswell asimmoveable property
wasoncecommon. Itstill is,toalarge extent, com-
mon tothefamily, and, atanearlier stage,when the
group washomogeneous, itwasnodoubt common to
thegroup orcommunity;forthecustom which allows
acreditor toseize theproperty ofathird party
belonging tothesamecommunity asthedebtor, seems
topoint toanotion that thecommunity asawhole
musthave benefited bywhat thedebtor received. If
allproperty were oncecommon tothegroup, asland
isnoAY, then thefollowing changes probably occurred.
When thehomogeneous group became heterogeneous,
andbroke upintoclans inconsequence ofthesystem
offemale descents, property became common tothe
clan. Then, when the clanbecame divided into
uterine families, property became common tothe

uterine family, asitstill isontheGold Coast;and,
wlien tlieuterine families came toanend,owing to
therecognition oftheblood-tie between father and
child, property became vested inhouseholds, asitis
with theYorubas. Inother words, astheunits of
which society was originally composed became sub-
divided into smaller and smaller groups, sodid
property become vested inagradually decreasing
number ofpersons, until itfinally became individual.
