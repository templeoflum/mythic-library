Myths of Ífè
By John Wyndham
[London, 1921]
{Reduced to HTML by Christopher M. Weimer, Dec. 2002}
This short book is a translation of some of the myths of the Yoruba people of Nigeria. It is a history of the creation of the world, the gods, and humanity, and the early days of the sacred city of Ífè, the traditional center of Yoruba culture. The text was recited to the author/translator by the high priests of Ífè, and the book is still cited in some books on traditional Yoruba religion and thought today. It has undeservedly become quite rare, as it  can be considered a minor classic in the field.
