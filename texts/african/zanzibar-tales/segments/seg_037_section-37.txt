The more we study Scripture in the light of the Holy Spirit, or practise
the Christian life in His power, the deeper becomes our conviction of
the unique and central place faith has in God's plan of salvation. And
we learn, too, to see that it is meet and right that it should be so:
the very nature of things demands it. Because God is a Spiritual and
Invisible Being, every revelation of Himself, whether in His works, His
word, or His Son, calls for faith. Faith is the spiritual sense of the
soul, being to it what the senses are to the body; by it alone we enter
into communication and contact with God.

Faith is that meekness of soul which waits in stillness to hear, to
understand, to accept what God says; to receive, to retain, to possess
what God gives or works. By faith we allow, we welcome God Himself, the
Living Person, to enter in to make His abode with us, to become our
very life. However well we think we know it, we always have to learn the
truth afresh, for a deeper and fuller application of it, that in the
Christian life faith is the first thing, the one thing that pleases God,
and brings blessing to us. And because Holiness is God's highest glory,
and the highest blessing He has for us, it is especially in the life of
holiness that we need to live by faith alone.

Our Lord speaks here of 'them that are sanctified by faith in me.'[9] He
Himself is our Sanctification as He is our Justification: for the one as
for the other it is faith that God asks, and both are equally given at
once. The participle used here is not the present, denoting a process or
work that is being carried on, but the aorist, indicating an act done
once for all. When we believe in Christ, we receive the whole Christ,
our justification and our sanctification: we are at once accepted by God
as righteous in Him, and as holy in Him. God counts and calls us, what
we really are, sanctified ones in Christ. It is as we are led to see
what God sees, as our faith grasps that the holy life of Christ is ours
in actual possession, to be accepted and appropriated for daily use,
that we shall really be able to live the life God calls us to, the life
of holy ones in Christ Jesus. We shall then be in the right position in
which what is called our progressive sanctification can be worked out.
It will be, the acceptance and application in daily life of the power of
a holy life which has been prepared in Jesus, which has in the union
with Him become our present and permanent possession, and which works in
us according to the measure of our faith.[10]

From this point of view it is evident that faith has a twofold
operation. Faith is the evidence of things not seen, though _now
actually existing_, the substance of things hoped for, but _not yet
present_. It deals with the unseen present, as well as with the unseen
future. As the evidence of things not seen, it rejoices in Christ our
complete sanctification, as a present possession. Through faith I simply
look to what Christ is, as revealed in the Word by the Holy Spirit.
Claiming all He is as my own, I know that His Holiness, His holy nature
and life, are mine; I am a holy one: by faith in Him I have been
sanctified. This is the first aspect of sanctification: it looks to what
is a complete and finished thing, an absolute reality. As the substance
of things hoped for, this faith reaches out in the assurance of hope to
the future, to things I do not yet see or experience, and claims, day by
day, out of Christ our sanctification, what it needs for practical
holiness, 'to be holy in all manner of living.' This is the second
aspect of sanctification: I depend upon Jesus to supply, in personal
experience, gradually and unceasingly, for the need of each moment,
what has been treasured up in His fulness. 'Of God are ye in Christ
Jesus, who of God is made unto us sanctification.' Under its first
aspect faith says, I know I am in Him, and all His Holiness is mine; in
its second aspect it speaks, I trust in Him for the grace and the
strength I need each moment to live a holy life.

And yet, it need hardly be said, these two are one. It is one Jesus who
is our sanctification, whether we look at it in the light of what He is
made for us once for all, or what, as the fruit of that, He becomes to
our experience day by day. And so it is one faith which, the more it
studies and adores and rejoices in Jesus as made of God unto us
sanctification, as Him in whom we have been sanctified, becomes the
bolder to expect the fulfilment of every promise for daily life, and the
stronger to claim the victory over every sin. Faith in Jesus is the
secret of a holy life: all holy conduct, all really holy deeds, are the
fruit of faith in Jesus as our holiness.

We know how faith acts, and what its great hindrances are, in the matter
of justification. It is well that we remind ourselves that there are the
same dangers in the exercise of sanctifying as of justifying faith.
Faith _in God_ stands opposed to trust _in self_: specially to its
willing and working. Faith is hindered by every effort to do something
ourselves. Faith looks to God working, and yields itself to His
strength, as revealed in Christ through the Spirit; it allows God to
work both to will and to do. Faith must work; without works it is dead,
by works alone can it be perfected; in Jesus Christ, as Paul says,
nothing avails but 'faith _working_ by love.' But these works, which
faith in God's working inspires and performs, are very different from
the works in which a believer often puts forth his best efforts, only to
find that he fails. The true life of holiness, the life of them who are
sanctified in Christ, has its root and its strength in an abiding sense
of utter impotence, in the deep restfulness which trusts to the working
of a Divine power and life, in the entire personal surrender to the
loving Saviour, in that faith which consents to be nothing, that He may
be all. It may appear impossible to discern or describe the difference
between the working that is of self and the working that is of Christ
through faith: if we but know that there is such a difference, if we
learn to distrust ourselves, and to count on Christ working, the Holy
Spirit will lead us into this secret of the Lord too. Faith's works are
Christ's works.

And as by effort, so faith is also hindered by the desire to see and
feel. 'If thou believest, thou shalt see;' the Holy Spirit will seal our
faith with a Divine experience; we shall see the glory of God. But this
is His work: ours is, when all appears dark and cold, in the face of all
that nature or experience testifies, still each moment to believe in
Jesus as our all-sufficient sanctification, in whom we are perfected
before God. Complaints as to want of feeling, as to weakness or
deadness, seldom profit: it is the soul that refuses to occupy itself
with itself, either with its own weakness or the strength of the enemy,
but only looks to what Jesus is, and has promised to do, to whom
progress in holiness will be a joyful march from victory to victory.
'The Lord Himself doth fight for you;' this thought, so often repeated
in connection with Israel's possession of the promised land, is the food
of faith: in conscious weakness, in presence of mighty enemies, it sings
the conqueror's song. When God appears to be _not doing_ what we trusted
Him for, then is just the time for faith to glory in Him.

There is perhaps nothing that more reveals the true character of faith
than joy and praise. You give a child the promise of a present
to-morrow: at once it says, Thank you, and is glad. The joyful thanks
are the proof of how really your promise has entered the heart. You are
told by a friend of a rich legacy he has left you in his will: it may
not come true for years, but even now it makes you glad. We have already
seen what an element of holiness joy is: it is especially an element of
holiness by faith. Each time I really see how beautiful and how perfect
God's provision is, by which my holiness is in Jesus, and by which I am
to allow Him to work in me, my heart ought to rise up in praise and
thanks. Instead of allowing the thought that it is, after all, a life of
such difficult attainment and such continual self-denial, this life of
holiness through faith, we ought to praise Him exceedingly that He has
made it possible and sure for us: we can be holy, because Jesus the
Mighty and the Loving One is our holiness. Praise will express our
faith; praise will prove it; praise will strengthen it. 'Then believed
they His words; they sang His praise.' Praise will commit us to faith:
we shall see that we have but one thing to do, to go on in a faith that
ever trusts and ever praises. It is in a living, loving attachment to
Jesus, that rejoices in Him, and praises Him continually for what He is
to us, that faith proves itself, and receives the power of holiness.

'Sanctified by faith in me.' Yes, 'by faith _in Me_:' it is the personal
living Jesus who offers Himself, Himself in all the riches of His Power
and Love, as the object, the strength, the life of our faith. He tells
us that if we would be holy, always and in everything holy, we must just
see to one thing: to be always and altogether full of faith in Him.
Faith is the eye of the soul: the power by which we discern the presence
of the Unseen One, as He comes to give Himself to us. Faith not only
sees, but appropriates and assimilates: let us set our souls very still
for the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, to quicken and strengthen that
faith, for which He has been given us. Faith is surrender: yielding
ourselves to Jesus to allow Him to do His work in us, giving up
ourselves to Him to live out His life and work out His will in us, we
shall find Him giving Himself entirely _to us_, and taking complete
possession. So faith will be power: the power of obedience to do God's
will: 'our most holy faith,' 'the faith delivered to the holy ones.'
And we shall understand how simple, to the single-hearted, is the secret
of holiness: just Jesus. We are in Him, our Sanctification: He
personally is our Holiness; and the life of faith in Him, that receives
and possesses Him, must necessarily be a life of holiness. Jesus says,
'Sanctified by faith in me.'

  BE YE HOLY, AS I AM HOLY.
