O God! we have again heard the wonderful revelation of Thyself, 'I am
holy.' And as we felt how infinitely exalted above all our conceptions
Thy Holiness is, we heard Thy call, almost still more wonderful, 'Be ye
holy, as I am holy.' And as every thought of how we were to be holy, as
Thou art holy, failed us, we heard Thy voice once again, in this most
wonderful word of all, 'I make you holy.' I am 'your Holy One.'

Most Holy God! we do beseech Thee, give us in some due measure to
realize how unholy we are, and so to take the place that becomes us in
Thy presence. Oh that the sinfulness of our nature, and all that is of
self, may be so discovered to us, that it may be no longer possible to
live in it! May the Light that reveals this, reveal too, how Thy
Holiness is our only hope, our sure refuge, our complete deliverance.
O Lord! speak into our souls the word, 'The Holy One, your Redeemer,'
'Your Holy One,' with such power by Thy Spirit, that our faith may grow
into the assured confidence that we can be holy as Thou art holy.

Holy Lord God! we wait for Thee. Reveal Thyself in power within us, and
fit us to be the messengers of Thy Holiness, to tell Thy people how holy
Thou art, and how holy we must be, and how holy Thou dost make us. Amen.

1. This Holy One is God Almighty. Before He revealed Himself to
     Israel as the Holy One, He made Himself known to Abraham as the
     Almighty, 'who quickeneth the dead.' In all your dealings with
     God for holiness, remember He is the Almighty One, who can do
     wonders in you. Say often, 'Glory to Him who is mighty to do
     exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think.'

  2. This Holy One is the Righteous God, a consuming fire. Cast
     yourself into it, that all that is sinful may be destroyed. As
     you lay yourself upon the altar, expect the fire. 'And yield
     your members unto God as instruments of Righteousness.'

  3. This Holy One is the God of Love. He is your Father; yield
     yourself to let the Holy Spirit cry in you, Abba Father! that
     is, to let Him shed abroad and fill your heart with God's
     father-love. God's Holiness is His fatherliness; our holiness
     is childlikeness. Be simple, loving, trustful.

  4. This Holy One is God. Let Him be God to you; ruling all,
     filling all, working all. Worship Him, come near to Him, live
     with and in and for Him: He will be your holiness.
