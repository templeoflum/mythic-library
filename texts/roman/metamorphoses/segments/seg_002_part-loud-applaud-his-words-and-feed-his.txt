Part loud applaud his words, and feed his rage;
  The rest assent in silence; yet to all,
  Man's loss seems grievous; anxious all enquire
  What form shall earth of him depriv'd assume?
  Who then shall incense to their altars bring?
  And if those rich and fertile lands he means
  A spoil for beasts ferocious? Their despair
  He bade them banish, and in him confide
  For what the future needed; held them forth
  The promise of a race unlike the first;
  Originating from a wonderous stock.

    And now his lightenings were already shot,
  And earth in flames, but that a fire so vast,
  He fear'd might reach Olympus, and consume
  The heavenly axis. Also call'd to mind
  What fate had doom'd, that all in future times
  By fire should perish, earth, and sea, and heaven;
  And all th' unwieldy fabric of the world
  Should waste to nought. The Cyclops' labor'd bolts
  Aside he laid. A different vengeance now,
  To drench with rains from every part of heaven,
  And whelm mankind beneath the rising waves,
  Pleas'd more th' immortal. Straightway close he pent
  The dry north-east, and every blast to showers
  Adverse, in caves AEolian, and unbarr'd
  The cell of Notus. Notus rushes forth
  On pinions dropping rain; his horrid face
  A pitchy cloud conceals; pregnant with showers
  His beard; and waters from his grey hairs flow:
  Mists on his forehead sit; in dews dissolv'd
  His arms and bosom, seem to melt away.
  With broad hands seizing on the pendent clouds
  He press'd them--with a mighty crash they burst,
  And thick and constant floods from heaven pour down.
  Iris meantime, in various robe array'd,
  Collects the waters and supplies the clouds.
  Prostrate the harvest lies, the tiller's hopes
  Turn to despair. The labors of an year,
  A long, long year, without their fruit are spent.
  Nor Jove's own heaven his anger could suffice,
  His brother brings him his auxiliar waves.
  He calls the rivers,--at their monarch's call
  His roof they enter, and in brief he speaks:
  "Few words we need, pour each his utmost strength,
  "The cause demands it; ope' your fountains wide,
  "Sweep every mound before you, and let gush
  "Your furious waters with unshorten'd reins."
  He bids--the watery gods retire,--break up
  Their narrow springs, and furious tow'rd the main
  Their waters roll: himself his trident rears
  And smites the earth; earth trembles at the stroke,
  Yawns wide her bosom, and upon the land
  A flood disgorges. Wide outspread the streams
  Rush o'er the open fields;--uproot the trees;
  Sweep harvests, flocks, and men;--nor houses stood;
  Nor household gods, asylums hereto safe.
  Where strong-built edifice its walls oppos'd
  Unlevell'd in the ruin, high above
  Its roof the billows mounted, and its towers
  Totter'd, beneath the watery gulf oppress'd.
  Nor land nor sea their ancient bounds maintain'd,
  For all around was sea, sea without shore.
  This seeks a mountain's top, that gains a skiff,
  And plies his oars where late he plough'd the plains.
  O'er fields of corn one sails, or 'bove the roofs
  Of towns immerg'd;--another in the elm
  Seizes th' intangled fish. Perchance in meads
  The anchor oft is thrown, and oft the keel
  Tears the subjacent vine-tree. Where were wont
  The nimble goats to crop the tender grass
  Unwieldy sea-calves roll. The Nereid nymphs,
  With wonder, groves, and palaces, and towns,
  Beneath the waves behold. By dolphins now
  The woods are tenanted, who furious smite
  The boughs, and shake the strong oak by their blows.
  Swims with the flock the wolf; and swept along,
  Tigers and tawny lions strive in vain.
  Now not his thundering strength avails the boar;
  Nor, borne away, the fleet stag's slender limbs:
  And land, long sought in vain, to rest her feet,
  The wandering bird draws in her weary wings,
  And drops into the waves, whose uncheck'd roll
  The hills have drown'd; and with un'custom'd surge
  Foam on the mountain tops. Of man the most
  They swallow'd; whom their fierce irruption spar'd,
  By hunger perish'd in their bleak retreat.

    Between th' Aoenian and Actaeian lands
  Lies Phocis; fruitful were the Phocian fields
  While fields they were, but now o'erwhelm'd, they form
  A region only of the wide-spread main.
  Here stands Parnassus with his forked top,
  Above the clouds high-towering to the stars.
  To this Deucalion with his consort driven
  O'er ridgy billows in his bark clung close;
  For all was sea beside. There bend they down;
  The nymphs, and mountain gods adore, and she
  Predicting Themis, then oraculous deem'd.
  No man more upright than himself had liv'd;
  Than Pyrrha none more pious heaven had seen.

    Now Jove beheld a mighty lake expand
  Where late was earth, and from the swarming crowds
  But one man sav'd--of woman only one:
  Both guiltless,--pious both. He chas'd the clouds
  And bade the dry north-east to drive the showers
  Far distant, and display the earth to heaven,
  And unto earth the skies. The ocean's rage
  Remains no more. Mild Neptune lays aside
  His three-fork'd weapon, and his surges smoothes;
  Then calls blue Triton from the dark profound.
  Above the waves the god his shoulders rears,
  With inbred purple ting'd: He bids him sound
  His shelly trump, and back the billows call;
  And rivers to their banks again remand.
  The trump he seizes,--broad above it wreath'd
  From narrow base;--the trump whose piercing blast
  From east to west resounds through every shore.
  This to his mouth the watery-bearded god
  Applies, and breathes within the stern command.
  All hear the sound, or waves of earth or sea,
  And all who hear obey. Sea finds a shore;
  Floods flow within their channels; rivers sink;
  Hills lift their heads; and as the waves decrease,
  In numerous islets solid earth appears.
  A tedious time elaps'd, and now the woods
  Display'd their leafless summits, and their boughs
  Heavy with mud. At length the world restor'd
  Deucalion saw, but empty all and void;
  Deep silence reigning through th' expansive waste:
  Tears gush'd while thus his Pyrrha he address'd:
  "O sister! wife! O woman sole preserv'd!--
  "By nature, kindred, and the marriage-bed,
  "To me most closely join'd. Now nearer still
  "By mutual perils. We, of all the earth
  "Beheld by Sol in his diurnal course,
  "We two alone remain. The mighty deep
  "Entombs the rest. Nor sure our safety yet;
  "Still hang the clouds dark louring. Wretched wife,
  "What if preserv'd alone? What hadst thou done
  "Of me bereft? How singly borne the shock?
  "Where found condolement in thy load of grief?
  "For me,--and trust, my dearest wife, my words,--
  "Hadst thou amidst the billows been ingulph'd,
  "Me also had they swallow'd. Oh! for power
  "To form mankind, as once my father did,
  "And in the shapen earth true souls infuse!
  "In us rests human race, so will the gods,
  "A sample only of mankind we live."
  He spoke and Pyrrha's tears join'd his. To heaven
  They raise their hands in prayer, and straight resolve
  To ask through oracles divine its aid.
  Nor long delay. Quick to Cephisus' streams
  They hasten; muddy still Cephisus flows,
  Yet not beyond its wonted boundaries swol'n.
  Libations thence they lift, and o'er their heads
  And garments cast the sprinklings;--then their steps
  To Themis' temple bend. The roof they found
  With filthy moss o'ergrown;--the altars cold.
  Prone on the steps they fell, and trembling kiss'd
  The gelid stones, and thus preferr'd their words:
  "If righteous prayers can move the heavenly mind,
  "And soften harsh resolves, and soothe the rage
  "Of great immortals, say, O Themis, say,
  "How to the world mankind shall be restor'd;
  "And grant, most merciful, in our distress
  "Thy potent aid." The goddess heard their words,
  And instant gave reply. "The temple leave,
  "Ungird your garments, veil your heads, and throw
  "Behind your backs your mighty mother's bones."
  Astonish'd long they stood! and Pyrrha first
  The silence broke; the oracle's behest
  Refusing to obey; and earnest pray'd,
  With trembling tongue for pardon for her sin:
  Her mother's shade to violate she dreads,
  Her bones thus rudely flinging. But meantime
  Deep in their minds, in dark mysterious veil
  Obscurely hid, the sentence they revolve.
  At length Deucalion sooths his wife with words
  Of cheering import: "Right, if I divine,
  "No impious deed the deity desires:
  "Earth is our mighty mother, and her bones
  "The stony rocks within her;--these behind
  "Our backs to cast, the oracle commands."
  With joy th' auspicious augury she hears,
  But joy with doubt commingled, both so much
  The heavenly words distrust; yet still they hope
  The essay cannot harm. The temple left,
  Their heads they cover, and their vests unbind;
  And o'er their heads as order'd heave the stones.
  The stones--(incredible! unless the fact
  Tradition sanction'd doubtless) straight began
  To lose their rugged firmness,--and anon,
  To soften,--and when soft a form assume.
  Next as they grew in size, they felt infus'd
  A nature mild,--their form resembled man!
  But incorrectly: marble so appears,
  Rough hewn to form a statue, ere the hand
  Completes the shape. What liquid was, and moist,
  With earthy atoms mixt, soft flesh became;
  Parts solid and unbending chang'd to bone;
  In name unalter'd, veins the same remain'd.
  Thus by the gods' beneficent decree,
  And brief the change, the stones Deucalion threw,
  A manly shape assum'd; but females sprung
  From those by Pyrrha cast behind; and hence
  A patient, hard, laborious race we prove,
  And shew the source, by actions, whence we sprung.

    Beings all else the teeming earth produc'd
  Spontaneous. Heated by the solar rays,
  The stagnant water quicken'd;--marshy fens
  Swell'd up their oozy loads to meet the beams:
  And nourish'd by earth's vivifying soil,
  The fruitful elements of life increas'd,
  As in a mother's womb; and in a while
  Assum'd a certain shape. So when the floods
  Of seven-mouth'd Nile desert the moisten'd fields,
  And to their ancient channels bring their streams,
  The soft mud fries beneath the scorching sun;
  And midst the fresh-turn'd earth unnumber'd forms
  The tiller finds: some scarcely half conceiv'd;
  Imperfect some, their bodies wanting limbs:
  And oft he beings sees with parts alive,
  The rest a clod of earth: for where with heat
  Due moisture kindly mixes, life will spring:
  From these in concord all things are produc'd.
  Though fire with water strives; yet vapour warm,
  Discordant mixture, gives a birth to all.

    Thus when the earth, with filthy ooze bespread
  From the late deluge, felt the blazing sun;
  His burning heat productive caus'd spring forth
  A countless race of beings. Part appear'd
  In forms before well-known; the rest a group
  Of monsters strange. Then, but unwilling, she
  Produc'd terrific Python, serpent huge!
  A mighty mountain with his bulk he hid;
  A plague unknown, the new-born race to scare.
  The quiver-shoulder'd god, unus'd before
  His arms to launch, save on the flying deer,
  Or roebuck fleet, the horrid monster slew:
  A thousand arrows in his sides he fix'd,
  His quiver's store exhausting; through the wounds
  Gush'd the black poison. To contending games,
  Hence instituted for the serpent slain,
  The glorious action to preserve through times
  Succeeding, he the name of Pythian gave.
  And here the youth who bore the palm away
  By wrestling, racing, or in chariot swift,
  With beechen bough was crown'd. Nor yet was known
  The laurel's leaf: Apollo's brows, with hair
  Deck'd graceful, no peculiar branches bound.

    Penaeian Daphne first his bosom charm'd;
  No casual flame but plann'd by Love's revenge.
  Him, Phoebus flush'd with conquest late obtain'd,
  His bow saw bend, and thus exclaim'd in taunt:
  "Lascivious boy! How ill with thee assort
  "Those warlike arms?--how much my shoulders more
  "Beseem the load, whose arm can deadly wounds
  "In furious beasts, and every foe infix!
  "I who but now huge Python have o'erthrown;
  "Swol'n with a thousand darts; his mighty bulk
  "Whole acres covering with pestiferous weight?
  "Content in vulgar hearts thy torch to flame,
  "To me the bow's superior glory leave."
  Then Venus' son: "O Phoebus, nought thy dart
  "Evades, nor thou canst 'scape the force of mine:
  "To thee as others yield,--so much my fame
  "Must ever thine transcend." Thus spoke the boy,
  And lightly mounting, cleaves the yielding air
  With beating wings, and on Parnassus' top
  Umbrageous rests. There from his quiver drew
  Two darts of different power:--this chases love;
  And that desire enkindles; form'd of gold
  It glistens, ending in a point acute:
  Blunt is the first, tipt with a leaden load;
  Which Love in Daphne's tender breast infix'd.
  The sharper through Apollo's heart he drove,
  And through his nerves and bones;--instant he loves:
  She flies of love the name. In shady woods,
  And spoils of captive beasts alone she joys;
  To copy Dian' emulous; her hair
  In careless tresses form'd, a fillet bound.
  By numbers sought,--averse alike to all;
  Impatient of their suit, through forests wild,
  And groves, in maiden ignorance she roams;
  Nor cares for Cupid, nor hymeneal rites,
  Nor soft connubial joys. Oft cry'd her sire;
  "My Daphne, you should bring to me a son;
  "From you, my child, I hope for grandsons too."
  But she detesting wedlock as a crime,
  (Suffus'd her features with a bashful glow)
  Around his aged neck, her beauteous arms,
  Winds blandishing, and cries, "O sire, most dear!
  "One favor grant,--perpetual to enjoy
  "My virgin purity;--the mighty Jove
  "The same indulgence has to Dian' given."
  Thy sire complies;--but that too beauteous face,
  And lovely form, thy anxious wish oppose:
  Apollo loves thee;--to thy bed aspires;--
  And looks with anxious hopes, his wish to gain:
  Futurity, by him for once unseen.
  As the light stubble when the ears are shorn,
  The flames consume: as hedges blaze on high
  From torches by the traveller closely held,
  Or heedless flung, when morning gilds the world:
  So flaming burnt the god;--so blaz'd his breast,
  And with fond hopes his vain desires he fed.
  Her tresses careless flowing o'er her neck
  He view'd, and, "Oh! how beauteous, deck'd with care,"
  Exclaim'd: her eyes which shone like brilliant fire,
  Or sparkling stars, he sees; and sees her lips;
  Unsated with the sight, he burns to touch:
  Admires her fingers, and her hands, her arms,
  Half to the shoulder naked:--what he sees
  Though beauteous, what is hid he deems more fair.
  Fleet as the wind, her fearful flight she wings,
  Nor stays his fond recalling words to hear:
  "Daughter of Peneus, stay! no foe pursues,--
  "Stay, beauteous nymph!--so flies the lamb the wolf;
  "The stag the lion;--so on trembling wings
  "The dove avoids the eagle:--these are foes,
  "But love alone me urges to pursue.
  "Ah me! then, shouldst thou fall,--or prickly thorns
  "Wound thy fair legs,--and I the cause of pain!--
  "Rough is the road thou runnest; slack, I pray,
  "Thy speed;--I swear to follow not so fast.
  "But hear who loves thee;--no rough mountain swain;
  "No shepherd;--none in raiments rugged clad,
  "Tending the lowing herds: rash thoughtless nymph,
  "Thou fly'st thou know'st not whom, and therefore fly'st!
  "O'er Delphos' lands, and Tenedos I sway,
  "And Claros, and the Pataraean realms.--
  "My sire is Jove. To me are all things known,
  "Or present, past, or future. Taught by me
  "Melodious sounds poetic numbers grace.--
  "Sure is my dart, but one more sure I feel
  "Lodg'd in this bosom; strange to love before.--
  "Medicine me hails inventor; through the world
  "My help is call'd for; unto me is known
  "The powers of plants and herbs:--ah! hapless I,
  "Nor plants, nor herbs, afford a cure for love;
  "Nor arts which all relieve, relieve their lord."
  All this, and more:--but Daphne fearful fled,
  And left his speech unfinish'd. Lovely then
  She running seem'd;--her limbs the breezes bar'd;
  Her flying raiment floated on the gale;
  Her careless tresses to the light air stream'd;
  Her flight increas'd her beauty. Now no more
  The god to waste his courteous words endures,
  But urg'd by love himself, with swifter pace
  Her footsteps treads: the rapid greyhound so,
  When in the open field the hare he spies,
  Trusts to his legs for prey,--as she for flight;
  And now he snaps, and now he thinks to hold,
  And brushes with his outstretch'd nose her heels;--
  She trembling, half in doubt, or caught or no,
  Springs from his jaws, and mocks his touching mouth.
  Thus fled the virgin and the god;--he fleet
  Through hope, and she through fear,--but wing'd by love
  More rapid flew Apollo;--spurning rest,
  Approach'd her close behind, and panting breath'd
  Upon her floating tresses. Pale with dread,
  Her strength exhausted in the lengthen'd flight,
  Old Peneus' streams she saw, and loud exclaim'd:--
  "O sire, assist me, if within thy streams
  "Divinity abides. Let earth this form,
  "Too comely for my peace, quick swallow up;
  "Or change those beauties to an harmless shape."
  Her prayer scarce ended, when her lovely limbs
  A numbness felt; a tender rind enwraps
  Her beauteous bosom; from her head shoots up
  Her hair in leaves; in branches spread her arms;
  Her feet but now so swift, cleave to the earth
  With roots immoveable; her face at last
  The summit forms; her bloom the same remains.
  Still loves the god the tree, and on the trunk
  His right hand placing, feels her breast yet throb,
  Beneath the new-grown bark: around the boughs,
  As yet her limbs, his clasping arms he throws;
  And burning kisses on the wood imprints.
  The wood his lips repels. Then thus the god:--
  "O laurel, though to be my bride deny'd,
  "Yet shalt thou be my tree; my temples bind;
  "My lyre and quiver shalt thou still adorn:
  "The brows of Latian conquerors shalt thou grace,
  "When the glad people sing triumphant hymns,
  "And the long pomp the capitol ascends.
  "A faithful guard before Augustus' gates,
  "On each side hung;--the sturdy oak between.
  "And as perpetual youth adorns my head
  "With locks unshorn, thou also still shalt bear
  "Thy leafy honors in perpetual green."
  Apollo ended, and the laurel bow'd
  Her verdant summit as her grateful head.

    Within AEmonia lies a grove, inclos'd
  By steep and lofty hills on every side:
  'Tis Tempe call'd. From lowest Pindus pour'd
  Here Peneus rolls his foaming waves along:
  Thick clouds of smoke, and dark and vapoury mists
  The violent falls produce, sprinkling the tops
  Of proudest forests with the plenteous dew;
  And distant parts astounding with the roar.
  Here holds the watery deity his throne;--
  Here his retreat most sacred;--seated here,
  Within the rock-form'd cavern, to the streams
  And stream-residing nymphs, his laws he gives.
  Here flock the neighbouring river-gods, in doubt
  Or to condole, or gratulate the sire.
  Here Spercheus came, whose banks with poplars wave;
  Rapid Enipeus; Apidanus slow;
  Amphrysos gently flowing; AEaes mild;
  And other streams which wind their various course,
  Till in the sea their weary wanderings end,
  By natural bent directed. Absent sole
  Was Inachus;--deep in his gloomy cave
  Dark hidden, with his tears he swells his floods.
  He, wretched sire, his Ioe's loss bewails;
  Witless if living air she still enjoys,
  Or with the shades she dwells; and no where found
  He dreads the worst, and thinks her not to be.
  The beauteous damsel from her father's banks
  Jove saw returning, and, "O, maid!" exclaim'd,
  "Worthy of Jove, whose charms will shortly bless
  "Some youth desertless; come, and seek the shade,
  "Yon lofty groves afford,"--and shew'd the groves,--
  "While now Sol scorches from heaven's midmost height.
  "Fear not the forests to explore alone,
  "But in their deepest shades adventurous go;
  "A god shall guard thee:--no plebeian god,
  "But he whose mighty hand the sceptre grasps
  "Of rule celestial, and the lightening flings.
  "O fly me not"--for Ioe fled, amaz'd.
  Now Lerna's pastures, and Lyrcaea's lands
  With trees thick-planted, far behind were left;
  When with a sudden mist the god conceal'd
  The wide-spread earth, and stopp'd her eager flight;
  And in his arms the struggling maid compress'd.
  Meantime did Juno cast her eyes below,
  The floating clouds surpris'd to see produce
  A night-like shade amidst so bright a day.
  No common clouds, from streams exhal'd, she knew;
  Nor misty vapours from the humid earth.
  Suspicions rise; her sharpness oft had caught
  Her amorous husband in his thefts of love.
  She search'd around the sky, its lord explor'd,--
  But not in heaven he sate;--then loud exclaim'd:
  "Much must I err, or much my bed is wrong'd."
  Down sliding from the topmost heaven, on earth
  She lights, and bids the cloudy mists recede.
  Prepar'd already, Jove the nymph had chang'd,
  And in a lovely heifer's form she stood.
  A shape so beauteous fair,--though sore chagrin'd,
  Unwilling Juno prais'd; and whence she came,
  And who her owner asks; and of what herd?
  Her prying art, as witless of the truth,
  To baffle, from the earth he feigns her sprung;
  And straight Saturnia begs the beauteous gift.
  Embarrass'd now he stands,--the nymph to leave
  Abandon'd, were too cruel;--to deny
  His wife, suspicious: shame compliance urg'd;
  Love strong dissuaded: love had vanquish'd shame,
  Save that a paltry cow to her refus'd,
  Associate of his race and bed, he fear'd
  More than a cow the goddess would suspect.
  Her rival now she holds; but anxious, still
  She Jove distrusts, and fears her prize to lose;
  Nor safe she deem'd her, till to Argus' care
  Committed. Round the jailor's watchful head
  An hundred eyes were set. Two clos'd in turn;
  The rest with watchful care, kept cautious guard.
  Howe'er he stands, on Ioe still he looks;
  His face averse, yet still his eyes behold.
  By day she pastures, but beneath the earth
  When Phoebus sinks, he drags her to the stall,
  And binds with cords her undeserving neck.
  Arbutus' leaves, and bitter herbs her food:
  Her wretched bed is oft the cold damp earth;
  A strawy couch deny'd:--the muddy stream
  Her constant drink: when suppliant she would raise
  Her arms to Argus, arms to raise were none.
  To moan she tries; loud bellowings echo wide,--
  She starts and trembles at her voice's roar.
  Now to the banks she comes where oft she'd play'd,--
  The banks of Inachus, and in his streams
  Her new-form'd horns beheld;--in wild affright
  From them she strove, and from herself to fly.
  Her sister Naiads know her not, nor he
  Griev'd Inachus, his long-lost daughter knows.
  But she her sisters and her sire pursues;
  Invites their touch, as wondering they caress.
  Old Inachus the gather'd herbs presents;
  She licks his hands, and presses with her lips
  His dear paternal fingers. Tears flow quick,
  And could words follow she would ask his aid;
  And speak her name, and lamentable state.
  Marks for her words she form'd, which in the dust
  Trac'd by her hoof, disclos'd her mournful change.
  "Ah wretch!" her sire exclaim'd, "unhappy wretch!"
  And o'er the weeping heifer's snowy neck,
  His arms he threw, and round her horns he hung
  With sobs redoubled:--"Art thou then, my child,
  "Through earth's extent so sought? Ah! less my grief,
  "To find thee not, than thus transform'd to find!
  "But dumb thou art, nor with responsive words,
  "Me cheerest. From thy deep chest sighs alone
  "Thou utterest, and loud lowings to my words:
  "Thou canst no more. Unwitting I prepar'd
  "Thy marriage torches, anxious to behold
  "A son, and next a son of thine to see.
  "Now from the herd a husband must thou seek,
  "Now with the herd thy sons must wander forth.
  "Nor death my woes can finish: curst the gift
  "Of immortality. Eternal grief
  "Must still corrode me; Lethe's gate is clos'd."
  Thus griev'd the god, when starry Argus tore
  His charge away, and to a distant mead
  Drove her to pasture;--he a lofty hill's
  Commanding prospect chose, and seated there
  View'd all around alike on every side.

    But now heaven's ruler could no more contain,
  To see the sorrows Ioe felt:--he calls
  His son, of brightest Pleiaed mother born,
  And bids him quickly compass Argus' death.
  Instant around his heels his wings he binds;
  His rod somniferous grasps; nor leaves his cap.
  Accoutred thus, from native heights he springs,
  And lights on earth; removes his cap; his wings
  Unlooses; and his wand alone retains:
  Through devious paths with this, a shepherd now,
  A flock he drives of goats, and tunes his pipe
  Of reeds constructed. Argus hears the sound,
  Junonian guard, and captivated cries,--
  "Come, stranger, sit with me upon this mount:
  "Nor for thy flock more fertile pasture grows,
  "Than round this spot;--and here the shade thou seest
  "To shepherds' ease inviting."--Hermes sate,
  And with his converse stay'd declining day.
  Long he discours'd, and anxious strove to lull
  With music sweet, the all-observant eyes;
  But long he strove in vain: soft slumber's bonds
  Argus opposes;--of his numerous lights,
  Part sleep, but others jealous watch his charge.
  And now he questions whence the pipe was form'd,
  The pipe but new-discover'd to the world.

    Then thus the god:--"A lovely Naiaed nymph,
  "With bleak Arcadia's Hamadryads nurs'd,
  "And on Nonacrine for beauty fam'd
  "Was Syrinx. Oft the satyrs wild she fled;
  "Nor these alone, but every god that roves
  "In shady forests, or in fertile fields.
  "Dian' she follows, and her virgin life.
  "Like Dian' cinctur'd, she might Dian' seem,
  "Save that a golden bow the goddess bears;
  "The nymph a bow of horn: yet still to most
  "Mistake was easy. From Lycaeum's height,
  "His head encompass'd with the pointed pine,
  "Returning, her the lustful Pan espy'd,
  "And cry'd:--Fair virgin grant a god's request,--
  "A god who burns to wed thee. Here he stays.
  "Through pathless forests flies the nymph, and scorns
  "His warm intreaties, till the gravelly stream
  "Of Ladon, smoothly winding, she beheld.
  "The waves impede her flight. She earnest prays
  "Her sister-nymphs her human form to change.
  "Now thinks the sylvan god his clasping arms
  "Inclose her, whilst he grasps but marshy reeds.--
  "He mournful sighs; the light reeds catch his breath,
  "And soft reverberate the plaintive sound.
  "The dulcet movement charms th' enraptur'd god,
  "Who,--thus forever shall we join,--exclaims!
  "With wax combin'd th' unequal reeds he forms
  "A pipe, which still the virgin's name retains."
  While thus the god, he every eye beheld
  Weigh'd heavy, sink in sleep, and stopp'd his tale.
  His magic rod o'er every lid he draws,
  His sleep confirming, and with crooked blade
  Severs his nodding head, and down the mount
  The bloody ruin hurls,--the craggy rock
  With gore besmearing. Low, thou Argus liest!
  Extinct thy hundred lights; one night obscure
  Eclipsing all. But Juno seiz'd the rays,
  And on the plumage of her favor'd bird,
  In gaudy pride, the starry gems she plac'd.

    With furious ire she flam'd, and instant sent
  The dread Erinnys to the Argive maid.
  Before her eyes, within her breast she dwelt
  A secret torment, and in terror drove
  Her exil'd through the world. 'Twas thou, O Nile!
  Her tedious wandering ended. On thy banks
  Weary'd she kneel'd, and on her back, supine
  Her neck she lean'd:--her sad face to the skies,
  What could she more?--she lifted. Unto Jove
  By groans, and tears, and mournful lows she plain'd,
  And begg'd her woes might end. The mighty god
  Around his consort's neck embracing hung.
  And pray'd her wrath might finish. "Fear no more
  "A rival love, in her," he said, "to see;"
  And bade the Stygian streams his words record.
  Appeas'd the goddess, Ioe straight resumes
  Her wonted shape, as lovely as before.
  The rough hair flies; the crooked horns are shed;
  Her visual orbits narrow; and her mouth
  In size contracts; her arms and hands return;
  Parted in five small nails her hoofs are lost:
  Nought of the lovely heifer now remains,
  Save the bright splendor. On her feet erect
  With two now only furnish'd, stands the maid.
  To speak she fears, lest bellowing sounds should break,
  And timid tries her long-forgotten words.
  Of mighty fame a goddess now, she hears
  Of nations linen-clad the pious prayers.

    Then bore she Epaphus, whose birth deriv'd
  From mighty Jove, his temples through the land,
  An equal worship with his mother's claim.
  Him Phaeton, bright Phoebus' youthful son,
  In years and spirit equall'd,--whose proud boasts,
  To all his sire preferring, Ioe's son
  Thus check'd: "O simple! thee thy mother's arts
  "To ought persuade. A feigned sire thou boast'st."
  Deep blush'd the youth, but shame his rage repress'd,
  And each reproach to Clymene he bore.
  "This too," he says, "O mother, irks me more,
  "That I so bold, so fierce, urg'd no defence:
  "Which shame is greater? that they dare accuse,
  "Or that accus'd, we cannot prove them false?
  "Do thou my mother,--if from heaven indeed
  "Descent I claim,--prove from what stock I spring.
  "My race divine assert." He said,--and flung
  Around her neck his arms; and by his life,
  The life of Merops, and his sisters' hopes
  Of nuptial bliss, adjures her to obtain
  Proofs of his birth celestial. Prayers like these
  The mother doubtless mov'd;--and rage no less
  To hear the defamation. Up to heaven
  Her arms she raises, gazing on the sun,
  And cries,--"My child! by yon bright rays I swear
  "In brilliance glittering, which now hear and view,
  "Our every word and action--thou art sprung
  "From him, the sun thou see'st;--the sun who rules
  "With tempering sway the seasons:--If untrue
  "My words, let me his light no more behold!
  "Nor long the toil to seek thy father's dome,
  "His palace whence he rises borders close
  "On our land's confines.--If thou dar'st the task,
  "Go forth, and from himself thy birth enquire."
  Elate to hear her words, the youth departs
  Instant, and all the sky in mind he grasps.
  Through AEthiopia's regions swiftly went,
  With India plac'd beneath the burning zone:
  And quickly reach'd his own paternal east.

THE *Second Book* OF THE METAMORPHOSES OF OVID.


    By towering columns bright with burnish'd gold,
  And fiery gems, which blaz'd their light around,
  Upborne, the palace stood. The lofty roof
  With ivory smooth incas'd. The folding doors,
  Of silver shone, but much by sculpture grac'd,
  For Vulcan there with curious hand had carv'd
  The ocean girding in the land; the land;
  And heaven o'ershadowing: here cerulean gods
  Sport in the waves, grim Triton with his shell;
  Proteus shape-changing; and AEgeon huge,--
  His mighty arms upon the large broad backs
  Of whales hard pressing: Doris and her nymphs:
  Some sportive swimming; on a rocky seat
  Some their green tresses drying; others borne
  By fish swift-gliding: nor the same all seem'd,
  Yet sister-like a close resembling look
  Each face pervaded. Earth her natives bore,
  Mankind;--and woods, and cities, there were seen;
  Wild beasts, and streams, and nymphs, and rural gods.
  'Bove all the bright display of heaven was hung--
  Six signs celestial o'er each portal grav'd.

    The daring youth, the steep ascent attain'd,
  O'erstepp'd the threshold of his dubious sire,
  And hasty rush'd to meet paternal eyes;
  But sudden stay'd: so fierce a blaze of light
  No nearer he sustain'd. In purple clad,
  The god a regal emerald throne upheld;
  Encircled round by hours which space the day;
  By days themselves; and ages, months, and years.
  Crown'd with a flowery garland Spring appear'd:
  Chaplets of grain the swarthy brows adorn'd
  Of naked Summer: smear'd with trodden grapes
  Stood Autumn: icy Winter fill'd the groupe;--
  Snow-white his shaggy locks. Sol from the midst
  His eyes all-seeing glanc'd upon the youth,
  Startled and trembling at the wonderous sight;
  And cried:--"What brings my Phaeton, my son,
  "Whose sire shall ne'er disclaim him? tell me now,
  "What here thou seekest?" Thus the youth replies:--
  "O father, Phoebus, universal light!
  "If justly, I thy honor'd name may use,
  "Nor proudly boasting Clymene conceals
  "A crime by falshood; grant paternal signs,
  "The world convincing that from thee I spring;
  "Reproachful doubts erasing from my mind."
  He said;--the sire the glittering rays removes
  That blaz'd around his head,--invites him nigh,
  And thus embracing:--"Proud I own thee, son,
  "For all is true by Clymene disclos'd.
  "If still thou doubtest, name the gift thou lik'st,--
  "That shalt thou have; for that will I bestow.
  "Ye streams unseen, which hear celestial oaths
  "My vows attest!" But scarce had Phoebus spoke,
  When Phaeton, the fiery car demands,--
  Demands his sway the winged-footed steeds
  One day should suffer. Soon the solemn oath
  Phoebus lamented: three times mournful shook
  His glorious tresses and in sorrow cry'd--
  "Would I could yet deny thee!--O my son!
  "All else with gladness will I hear thee ask;--
  "List to persuasion,--perseverance sure
  "Will risk thy ruin. Phaeton, my child!
  "The task thou seek'st is arduous; far unfit
  "For those weak arms, and age so immature.
  "Mortal,--thou would'st a seat immortal press.
  "Ignorant of grasping more than all the gods
  "Attempt to manage. Every power we grant
  "Diverse excels; but I of all the gods,
  "Have force in that igniferous car to stand.
  "Ev'n Jove, the ruler of Olympus vast,
  "Whose right hand terrible fierce lightenings hurls,
  "This chariot never rul'd: and who than Jove,
  "More mighty deem we? Steep the first ascent,
  "The fresh steeds clamber up the height with pain:
  "High in mid heaven arriv'd, to view beneath
  "Ocean and earth, oft strikes even me with fear,
  "And with dread palpitation shakes my breast.
  "Prerupt the end, and asks a firm restraint;
  "Tethys herself who nightly me receives,
  "Beneath the waves, fears oft my headlong fall.
  "Nor all;--the skies a constant whirling bears
  "In rapid motion, and the heavenly orbs
  "Sweep with them swift; I strive the adverse my;
  "Nor can th' impetuous force which whirls the rest
  "Bear with them me; I stem the rapid world
  "With force superior. Grant, the car I yield,--
  "Could'st thou the swift rotation of the poles
  "Stem nervous, nor be borne with them along?
  "Perchance imagination fills thy mind,
  "With groves, and dwellings of celestial gods,
  "And temples richly deck'd with offer'd gold,
  "Where thou shall pass. Far else;--thy journey lies,
  "Through ambushes, and savage monsters' forms.
  "Ev'n shouldst thou lucky not erratic stray,
  "Yet must thou pass the Bull's opposing horns;
  "The bow Haemonian, by the Centaur bent;
  "The Lion's countenance grim; the Scorpion's claws
  "Bent cruel in a circuit large; the Crab
  "In lesser compass curving. Hard the task
  "To rule the steeds with those fierce fires inflam'd,
  "Within their breasts, which through their nostrils glow.
  "Scarce bear they my control, when mad with heat
  "Their high necks spurn the rein. But, oh! my son,
  "Beware lest I a fatal gift bestow.
  "Retract, while yet thou may'st, thy rash demand.
  "Sure tokens thou requir'st to prove thee sprung
  "From me,--the genuine offspring of my blood:
  "My anxious trembling is a token true;
  "Paternal terrors plainly prove the sire.
  "Lo! on my features fix thine eyes; as well,
  "I would thou could'st them place within my breast,
  "And view the anguish of a father's cares.
  "Last throw thy looks around; the riches view,
  "Whatever earth contains, and some demand;
  "Some of so many and such mighty gifts:
  "In heaven, or earth, or sea, 'tis undeny'd.
  "This only would I grant not, as its grant
  "Is punishment, not favor. Phaeton
  "Asks evil for a gift. Why, foolish boy,
  "Hang on my neck thus coaxing with thine arms?
  "Whate'er thou would'st, thou shalt. The Stygian streams
  "Have heard me swear. But make a wiser wish."
  His admonition ceas'd, but all advice
  Was bootless: still his resolution holds;
  To guide the chariot still his bosom burns.
  The sire, his every effort vain, at length
  Forth to the lofty car, Vulcanian gift,
  Brings the rash youth. Of gold the axle shone;
  The pole of gold; by gold the rolling wheels
  Were circled; every spoke with silver bright;
  Upon the seat bright chrysolites display'd,
  With various jewels shed a dazzling light,
  From Sol reflected. All the high-soul'd youth
  Admir'd, and while he curious view'd each part,
  Behold Aurora from the purple east
  Wide throws the ruddy portals, and displays
  The halls with roses strewn: the starry host
  Fly, driven by Lucifer,--himself the last
  To quit his heavenly station. Sol beheld
  The earth and sky grow red, and Luna's horns
  Blunt, and prepar'd to vanish. Straight he bade
  The flying hours to yoke the steeds: his words
  The nimble goddesses obey, and lead
  The steeds fire-breathing from their lofty stalls,
  Ambrosia fed, and fix the sounding reins.
  Then with a sacred ointment Phoebus smear'd
  The face of Phaeton,--unscorch'd to bear
  The fervid blaze; and on his head a crown
  Of rays he fix'd. His smother'd sighs within
  His anxious breast, sad presages of woe
  Suppressing, thus he spoke:--"If now my words
  "Though late, thou heedest, spare, O boy! the lash,
  "But tightly grasp the reins: unbid they run,
  "They fly; to check their flight thy labor asks.
  "Not through the five bright zones thy journey lies:
  "Obliquely winds the path, with spacious curve,
  "Three girdles only touching; leaving far
  "The pole Antarctic, and the northern Bear:
  "Be this thy track; there plain thou may'st discern
  "The marks my wheels have made. Since heaven and earth
  "An equal portion of my influence claim;
  "Press not the car too low, nor mount aloft
  "Near topmost heaven: there would'st thou fire the roof
  "Celestial;--here the earth thou would'st consume.
  "For safety keep the midst. Let thy right wheel
  "Approach the tortuous Snake not: nor thy left
  "Press near the Altar:--hold the midmost course.
  "Fortune the rest must rule; may she assist
  "Thy undertaking; for thy safety act
  "Better than thou. But more delay deny'd,
  "Lo! whilst I speak the dewy night has touch'd
  "The boundaries plac'd upon th' Hesperian shore.
  "I'm call'd,--for, darkness fled, Aurora shines.
  "Seize then, the reins, or if thy mind relents,
  "My counsel rather than my chariot take.
  "Now whilst thou can'st; whilst on a solid base
  "Thou standest, ere thou yet unskilful mount'st
  "The chariot ev'lly wish'd: give me to dart
  "Those rays on earth which thou may'st safely view:"
  Agile the youth bounds from his sire, and stands
  Proud in the chariot; joyously he holds
  Th' entrusted reigns, and from the seat glad thanks
  Th' unwilling parent gives. Meantime neigh'd loud
  In curling flames, the winged steeds of Sol,
  Pyroeis, AEthon, Phlegon, Eous swift;
  And with impatient hoofs the barrier beat;
  Which Tethys, ignorant of her grandson's fate,
  Drove back, and open laid the range of heaven.
  Swiftly they hasten,--swiftly fly their heels,
  Through the thin air, and through opposing clouds.
  Pois'd by their wings the eastern gales they pass,
  Which started with them: but their burthen light,
  Small felt the pressure on the chariot seat:
  Not what the steeds of Sol had felt before.
  As ships unpois'd reel tottering through the waves,
  Light and unsteady, rambling o'er the main;
  So bounds the car, void of its 'custom'd weight,
  High-toss'd as though unfill'd. This quick perceiv'd,
  Fierce rush the four-yok'd steeds, and quit the path
  Beaten before, and tread a road unknown.
  Trembling the youth nor knows to pull the reins
  Which side, nor knowing would the steeds obey.
  Then first the frozen Trioenes from Sol
  Felt warm, and try'd, but try'd in vain, to dip
  Beneath the sea. The frozen polar snake,
  Sluggish with cold, and indolently mild,
  Warm'd, and dire fierceness gather'd from the flames.
  Thou too, Booetes, fled'st away disturb'd,
  Though slow thy flight, retarded by thy teams.
  And now the luckless Phaeton his eyes
  Cast on the earth remote,--far distant spread
  Beneath the lofty sky; pale grew his face
  With sudden terror; trembled his weak knees;
  O'ercome with light his eyes in darkness sunk:
  Glad were he now, his father's steeds untouch'd:
  Griev'd that his race he knows; griev'd his request
  Was undeny'd: glad were he now if call'd
  The son of Merops. Ev'n as Boreas sweeps
  Furious the vessel, when the pilot leaves
  The helm to heaven, and puts his trust in prayers
  So was he hurry'd. What remains to do?
  Vast space of heaven behind him lies;--much more
  He forward views. Each distance in his mind
  Compar'd he measures. Now he forward bends
  To view the west, forbidden him to reach;
  Now to the east he backward turns his eyes.
  With terror stunn'd his trembling hands refuse
  To hold the reins with vigor; yet he holds.
  The coursers' names, affrighted he forgets:
  Trembling he views the various monsters spread
  Through every part above; and figures huge
  Of beasts ferocious. Heaven a spot contains,
  Where Scorpio bends in two wide bows his arms,
  His tail, and doubly-stretching claws;--the space
  Encompassing of two celestial signs.
  Soon as the youth the monstrous beast beheld,
  Black poison sweating, and with crooked sting
  Threatening fierce wounds, he nerveless dropp'd the reins:
  Pale dread o'ercame him. Quick the steeds perceiv'd
  The loose thongs playing on their backs, and rush'd
  Wide from the path, uncheck'd;--through regions strange,
  Now here, now there, impetuous;--unrestrain'd,
  Amidst the loftiest stars they dash, and drag
  The car through pathless places: upward now
  They labor;--headlong now they down descend,
  Nearing the earth. With wonder Luna sees
  Her brother's coursers run beneath her own;
  And sees the burnt clouds smoking. Lofty points
  Of earth, feel first the flames, and fissures wide,
  Departing moisture prove. The forage green,
  Whitens; trees crackle with their burning leaves;
  And ripe corn adds its fuel to the blaze.
  Why mourn we trifles? Mighty cities fall;
  Their walls protect them not; their dwellers sink
  To ashes with them. Woods on mountains flame;--
  Athos, Cilician Taurus, Tmolus, burn;
  Oete, and Ide, her pleasant fountains dry;
  With virgin Helicon, and Haemus high,
  OEagrius since. Now with redoubled flames
  Fierce Etna blazes;--Eryx, Othrys too;
  Cynthus, and fam'd Parnassus' double top,
  And Rhodope, at length of snow depriv'd:
  Dindyma, Mimas, and the sacred hill
  Cythaeron nam'd, and lofty Mycale:
  Nor aid their snows the Scythians: Ossa burns,
  Pindus, and Caucasus, and, loftier still,
  The huge Olympus; with the towering Alps;
  And cloud-capt Apennines. Now the youth,
  Beholds earth flaming fierce from every part;--
  The heat o'erpowers him; fiery air he breathes
  As from a furnace; and the car he rides
  Glows with the flame beneath him: sore annoy'd
  On every side by cinders, and by smoke
  Hot curling round him. Whither now he drives,
  Or where he is, he knows not; in a cloud
  Of pitchy night involv'd; swept as the steeds
  Swift-flying will. The AEthiopians then,
  'Tis said, their sable tincture first receiv'd;
  Their purple blood the glowing heat call'd forth
  To tinge their skins. Then dry'd the scorching fire
  From arid Lybia all her fertile streams.
  Now with dishevell'd locks the nymphs bewail'd
  Their fountains and their lakes. Boeotia mourns
  The loss of Dirce: Argos Amymone:
  Corinth laments Pirene. Nor yet safe
  Were rivers bounded by far distant shores,
  Tanais' midmost waves fume to the sky;
  And ancient Peneus smokes: Ismenos swift;
  Caicus, Teuthrantean; and the flood
  Of Phocis, Erymanthus: Xanthus too,
  Doom'd to be fir'd again: Lycormas brown;
  Maeander's sportive oft recircling waves;
  Mygdonian Melas; and the Spartan flood,
  Eurotas; with Euphrates burn: and burn,
  Orontes; and the rapid Thermodoon;
  Ganges; and Phasis; and the Ister swift.
  Alpheus boils; the banks of Spercheus burn;
  And Tagus' golden sands the flames dissolve.
  Stream-loving swans, whose song melodious rung
  Throughout Maeonian regions, feel the heat,
  Caister's streams amid. In terror Nile
  Fled to the farthest earth, and sunk his head,
  Yet undiscover'd!--void the seven-fold stream,
  His mouth seven dry and dusty vales disclos'd.
  Now Hebrus dries, and Strymon, Thracian floods:
  And streams Hesperian, Rhine; and Rhone; and Po;
  And Tiber, destin'd all the world to rule.
  Asunder split the globe, and through the chinks
  Darted the light to hell: the novel blaze,
  Pluto and Proserpine with terror view'd.
  The ocean shrinks;--a dry and scorching plain
  Where late was sea appears. Hills lift their heads
  Late by the deep waves hid, and countless seem
  The scatter'd Cyclades. Deep crouch the fish;--
  The crooked dolphins dare not leap aloft,
  As, custom'd in the air; with breasts upturn'd
  The gasping sea-calves float upon the waves:
  Nereus, with Doris and her daughter-nymphs
  Deep plung'd to seek their low, but tepid caves.
  Thrice Neptune ventur'd to upraise his arms
  Grim frowning,--thrice the flames too fierce he found,
  And shrunk beneath the waters. Earth at length,
  (By streams and founts encircled,--for her womb
  Trembling they sought for refuge) rais'd on high
  Her face omniferous, dry and parch'd with heat;
  Her burning forehead shaded with her hand;
  Shook all with tremor huge; then shrank for shade
  Beneath, and gasping, thus to heaven she plain'd:

    "Almighty lord! if such thy sovereign will,
  "And I deserve it, why thy lightenings hold
  "Thus idle? If by fire to perish doom'd,--
  "Be it by thine,--an honorable fate!
  "Scarce can my lips now utter forth my pains!--
  Volumes of smoke oppress'd her--"See, my hair
  "Sing'd with the flames! Behold my face,--my eyes,
  "Scorch'd with hot embers! Is no better boon
  "Due for the fruits I furnish? Such reward,
  "Suits it my fertile crops? or cruel wounds
  "Of harrow, rake, and plough, which through the year
  "Enforc'd I suffer? For the herds I bring
  "Green herbs and grass; bland aliments, ripe fruit
  "For man; and incense for ye mighty gods:
  "Faulty is this? But grant thy wrath deserv'd,
  "How do the waves, thy brother's realm offend?
  "Why does the main, to him by lot decreed,
  "Shrink and retreat from heaven? Thy brother's weal,
  "Say it concerns thee not, nor my distress;
  "Care for thy own paternal heaven may move.
  "Thine eyes cast round,--black smoke from either pole
  "Mounts!--soon the greedy flames your halls will seize.
  "Lo! Atlas labors;--scarcely he sustains
  "The burning load. If earth and ocean flame,
  "And heaven too perish, all to chaoes turn'd,
  "Confounded we shall sink. Snatch from the flames
  "What yet, if ought, remains, and nature save."
  No more could Earth, for now thick vapors rose,
  Her speech obstructing; down she shrunk her head,
  And shelter'd 'midst the cool Tartarian shades.

    Now Jove, the gods, all witness to the fact
  Conven'd; ev'n Sol, the donor of the car,
  That but for him the world in ruins soon
  Would lie. The loftiest height of heaven he gains,
  Whence clouds he wont upon the wide-spread earth
  To shower;--from whence his thunders loud he hurl'd;
  And quivering lightenings flung: but now nor clouds,
  Nor showers to rain on earth the sovereign had.
  He thunders;--from his right-ear pois'd, the bolt
  Hurls on the charioteer. Life, and the car,
  Phaeton quits at once;--his fatal fires,
  By fires more fierce extinguish'd. Startled prance
  The steeds confounded; free their fiery necks
  From the torn reins: here lie the traces broke;
  There the strong axle, sever'd from the seat;
  Spokes of the shatter'd wheels are here display'd;
  And scatter'd far and wide the car's remains.
  Hurl'd headlong falls the youth, his golden locks,
  Flame as he tumbles, swept through empty air,
  A lengthen'd track he forms: so seems a star
  In night serene, but only seems, to shoot.
  Far from paternal home, the mighty Po
  Receiv'd his burning corps, and quench'd the flames.

    Due rites the nymphs Hesperian gave the limbs
  From the fork'd lightening flaming. On his tomb
  This epitaph they grav'd: "Here Phaeton
  "Intombed rests; the charioteer so bold,
  "Of Phoebus' car, which though he fail'd to rule,
  "He perish'd greatly daring." Griev'd his sire,
  Veil'd his sad face; and, were tradition true,
  One day saw not the sun; the embers blaz'd
  Sufficient light: thus may misfortune aid.

    When Clymene with all that sorrow could
  To ease her woes give utterance, loud had wail'd
  In wild lament; all spark of reason fled,
  Her bosom tearing, through the world she roam'd.
  And now his limbs inanimate she sought;
  Then for his whiten'd bones: his bones she found,
  On banks far distant from his home inhum'd.
  Prone on his tomb her form she flung, and pour'd
  Her tears in floods upon the graven lines:
  And with her bosom bar'd, the cold stone warm'd.
  His sisters' love their fruitless offerings bring,
  Their griefs and briny droppings; cruel tear
  Their beauteous bosoms; while they loudly call
  Phaeton, deaf to all their mournful cries.
  Stretch'd on his tomb, by night, by day they call'd.
  Till Luna's circle four times fill'd was seen;
  Their blows still given as 'custom'd, (use had made
  Their forms of grief as nature). Sudden plain'd
  Fair Phaethusa, eldest of the three,
  Of stiffen'd feet; as on the tomb she strove
  To cast her body prone. Lampetie bright,
  Rushing in hope to aid, a shooting root
  Abruptly held. With lifted hands the third
  Her locks to tear attempted; but green leaves
  Tore off instead. Now this laments her legs,
  Bound with thin bark; that mourns to see her arms
  Shoot in long branches. While they wonder thus,
  Th' increasing bark their bodies upward veils,
  Their breasts, their arms, and hands, with gradual growth:
  Their mouths alone remain; which loudly call
  Their mother. What a mother could, she did:
  What could she do? save, here and there to fly,
  Where blind affection dragg'd her; and while yet,
  'Twas given to join, join with them mouth to mouth.
  Nor this contents; she strives to tear the rind,
  Their limbs enwrapping; and the tender boughs
  Pluck from their hands: but from the rended spot
  The sanguine drops flow swift. Each suffering nymph
  Cries,--"Spare me, mother!--spare your wounded child;
  "I suffer in the tree.--farewell!--farewell!"--
  For as they spoke the rind their mouths inclos'd.
  From these new branches tears were dropp'd, and shap'd
  By solar heat, bright amber straight compos'd.
  Dropt in the lucid stream, the prize was borne
  To Latium, and its gayest nymphs adorn'd.

    This wonderous change Sthenelian Cycnus saw;
  To thee, O Phaeton, by kindred join'd,
  But by affection closer. He his realms,
  (For o'er Liguria's large and populous towns
  He reign'd) had then relinquish'd. With his plaints,
  The Po's wide stream was fill'd; and fill'd the banks
  With his lamentings; ev'n the woods, whose shade
  The sister poplars thicken'd. Soon he feels
  His utterance shrill and weak: his streaming locks
  Soft snowy plumes displace: high from his chest,
  His lengthen'd neck extends: a filmy web
  Unites his ruddy toes: his sides are cloth'd
  With quills and feathers: where his mouth was seen
  Expanded, now a blunted beak obtains;
  And Cycnus stands a bird;--but bird unknown
  In days of yore. Mistrustful still of Jove,
  His heaven he shuns; as mindful of the flames
  From thence unjustly hurl'd. Wide lakes and ponds
  He seeks to habit now;--indignant shuns
  What favors fire, and joys in purling streams.

    Meantime was Phoebus dull, his blaze obscur'd,
  As when eclips'd his orb: his rays he hates;
  Himself; and even the day. To grief his soul
  He gives, and anger to his grief he joins;
  Depriving earth of all its wonted light.
  "Troubled my lot has been," he cry'd, "since first
  "Was publish'd my existence:--urg'd my toil
  "Endless,--still unremitted, still unprais'd.
  "Now let who will my furious chariot drive
  "Flammiferous! If every god shall shrink
  "Inadequate,--let Jove the task attempt:
  "Then while my reins he tries, at least those flames,
  "Which cause parental grief must peaceful rest.
  "Then when the fiery flaming coursers strain
  "His nervous arms, no more he'll judge the youth
  "Of death deserving, who could less control."
  Sol, grieving thus, the deities surround,
  And suppliant beg that earth may mourn no more,
  By darkness 'whelm'd. Ev'n Jove concession gave,--
  And why his fiery bolts were launch'd explain'd;
  But threats and prayers majestically mix'd.
  The steeds with terror trembling, Phoebus seiz'd,
  Wild from their late affright, and rein'd their jaws;
  Furious he wields his goad and lash, and fierce
  He storms, and their impetuous fury blames
  At every blow, as murderers of his son.

   High heaven's huge walls the mighty sire explores,
  With eye close searching, lest a weakening flaw,
  Might hurl some part to ruin. All he found
  Firm in its pristine strength;--then glanc'd his eye
  Around the earth, and toils of man below.
  'Bove all terrestrial lands, Arcadia felt--
  His own Arcadia--his preserving care.
  Her fountains he restores; her streams not yet
  To murmur daring; to her fields he gives
  Seed-corn; and foliage to her spreading boughs;
  And her scorch'd forests bids again look green.
  Through here as oft he journey'd, and return'd,
  A virgin of Nonacrine he spy'd,
  And instant inward fire the god consum'd.
  No nymph was she whose skill the wool prepar'd;
  Nor comb'd with art her tresses seem'd; full plain,
  Her vest a button held; a fillet white
  Careless her hair confin'd. Now pois'd her hand
  A javelin light, and now a bow she bore:
  In Dian's train she ran, nor nymph more dear
  To her the mountain Maenalus e'er trode.
  But brief the reign of favor! Sol had now
  Beyond mid-heaven attain'd; Calistho sought
  A grove where felling axe had never rung:
  Here was her quiver from her shoulder thrown;
  Her slender bow unstrung; and on the ground
  With soft grass clad she rested: 'neath her neck
  Was plac'd the painted quiver. Jove, the maid
  Weary'd beheld, and from her wonted troop
  Far distant. "Surely now, my wife," he cries,
  "This theft can ne'er discover. Should she know,
  "What is her rage with such a prize compar'd?"
  Then Dian's face and form the god conceal'd;
  Loud calling,--"Where, O virgin, hast thou stray'd?
  "What hills, my comrade, hast thou crost in chase?"
  Light springing from the turf, the nymph reply'd,--
  "Hail goddess, greater, if with me the palm,
  "Than Jove himself, though Jove himself should hear."
  The feign'd Diana smil'd, and joy'd to hear
  Him to himself preferr'd; then press'd her lips
  With kisses, such as virgins never give
  To virgins. Her, prepar'd to tell the woods
  Where late she hunted, with a warm embrace
  He hinder'd; and his crime the god disclos'd.
  Hard strove the nymph,--and what could female more?
  (O Juno, hadst thou seen her, less thy ire!)
  Long she resists, but what can nymph attain,
  Or any mortal, when to Jove oppos'd?
  Victor the god ascends th' ethereal court.

    The groves and forests, conscious of the deed,
  Calistho hates; so swift she flies the spot,
  Her quiver, and her darts, and slender bow
  Suspended on the tree, through eager haste
  Were nigh forgotten. Lo! Diana comes,
  By clustering nymphs attended, o'er the hills
  Of lofty Maenalus, from slaughter'd beasts,
  Proudly triumphant. She Calistho sees,
  And calls her;--as the goddess calls she flies,
  Fearing another Jove disguis'd to meet.
  But when th' attendant virgin-troop appear'd,
  Fraud she no more suspected, but the train
  Join'd fearless. Hard the countenance to form,
  And not betray a perpetrated crime!
  Scarce from the ground she dar'd her looks to raise;
  Nor with her wonted ardor press'd before,
  First of the throng, close to Diana's side.
  Silent she moves; her blushes prove a wound
  Her modesty had felt. E'en Dian' might,
  (But that a virgin,) all the truth have known.
  By numerous proofs and strong. Nay, fame reports
  Her sister-nymphs had long her shame perceiv'd.
  Nine times had Luna now her orb renew'd,
  When Dian' from the chase retreating faint
  By Phoebus' rays, had gain'd a forest cool,
  Where flow'd a limpid stream with murmuring noise,
  The shining sand upturning. Much the spot
  The goddess tempted, and her feet she dipp'd
  Light in the waves, as to the nymphs she cry'd:--
  "Hence far each prying eye, we'll dare unrobe
  "And lave beneath the stream." Calistho blush'd;--
  Quick while the other nymphs their bodies bare,
  Protracting she undresses. From her limbs,
  Suspicious they the garments rend, and view
  Her body naked, and her fault is plain.
  To her, confus'd, whose trembling hands essay'd
  Her shame to hide, Diana spoke;--"Hence fly,--
  "Far hence, nor more these sacred streams pollute."
  And drove her instant from her spotless train.

    Long time the mighty thunderer's queen had known
  Calistho's state; but curb'd her furious ire
  Till ripe occasion suited: longer now
  Delay were needless; now the nymph produc'd
  Arcas; whom Juno more enrag'd beheld.
  With savage mind, and furious look she ey'd
  The boy, and spoke;--"Adulteress! this alone
  "Was wanting! fruitful, harlot, hast thou prov'd?
  "Must by this birth my wrongs in public glare?
  "And what dishonor I from Jove receive
  "Be palpable to sight. Expect not thou
  "Impunity to find. Thy form I'll change,--
  "To thee so pleasing, and so dear to Jove."
  She said; and on the flowing tresses seiz'd
  Which o'er her forehead stream'd, and prostrate dragg'd
  The nymph to earth. She rais'd her suppliant hands,--
  With black hairs cover'd, rough her arms appear'd;
  Bent were her hands, and, with her lengthen'd nails
  To claws transform'd, press'd on the ground as feet;
  Her mouth so beauteous, late of Jove admir'd,
  Yawn'd wide deformity;--and lest soft prayers
  And flowing words, might pity move, no power
  To speak she left. Now through her hoarse throat sounds
  An angry threatening voice that fear instills;
  A bear becoming, though her sense the same:
  Her sufferings proving by her constant groans.
  Lifting to heaven such hands as lift she could,
  Jove she ungrateful found, but Jove to call
  Ungrateful, strove in vain. Alas! how oft
  In woods and solitudes, to sleep afraid,
  She roam'd around the house and fertile fields
  Of late her own!---Alas, how oft thence driven
  By yelping hounds o'er craggy steeps she fled!
  Thou dread'st the hunters though an huntress thou!
  Oft was her form forgotten, and in fear
  From beasts she crouch'd conceal'd: the shaggy bear
  Shudder'd to see the bears upon the hills;
  And at the wolves she trembled, though with wolves
  Her sire Lycaoen howl'd. Now Arcas comes;
  Arcas, her son, unconscious of his race.
  Near fifteen suns the youth had seen revolv'd;
  And while the game he chases, while he seeks
  Thickets best suited for his sports, and round
  The Erymanthean woods his toils he sets,
  He meets his mother:--at his sight she stay'd,
  The well-known object viewing. Arcas fled
  Trembling, unconscious why those eyes were fix'd
  On him immoveably. His spear, prepar'd
  To pierce his mother's breast, as near she draws
  The youth protends. But Jove the deed prevents:
  Both bears away, and stays the matricide.
  Swept through the void of heaven by rapid whirl
  They're borne, and neighbouring constellations made,
  Loud Juno rag'd, to see the harlot shine,
  Amid the stars; and 'neath the deep descends,
  To hoary Tethys, and her ancient spouse;
  Where reverence oft the host of heaven had shewn.
  And thus to them, who anxious seek the cause,
  Why there she journeys. "Wish ye then to know
  "Why I the queen of heaven, my regal seat
  "Now leave? Another fills my lofty throne!
  "Nor false I speak,--for when gray night shall spread
  "O'er all,--new constellations shall you see
  "Me irking,--on the utmost bounds of heaven,
  "Where the last shorten'd zone the axis binds.
  "Now surely none, t' insult shall rashly dare
  "The thunderer's spouse, but tremble at her frown;
  "For she who most offends is honor'd most!
  "Much has my power perform'd!--vast is my sway!
  "Her human form I chang'd,--and lo! she shines
  "A goddess;--thus the guilty feel my ire!
  "Thus potent I. Why not her form restore,
  "And change that beastly shape, as Ioe once
  "In Argolis, the same indulgence felt.
  "Why drives he not his consort from his bed,
  "Calistho placing there;--for sire-in-law
  "The wolf Lycaoen chusing? If to you
  "Your foster-daughter's insults ought import,
  "Forbid these stars to touch the blue profound:
  "Repel those constellations, plac'd in heaven,
  "Meed of adultery; lest the harlot dip
  "In your pure waves."--The gods their promise gave
  And through the liquid air Saturnia flies,
  Borne in her chariot by her peacocks bright;
  Their coats gay studded from fall'n Argus' eyes.

    Less beauteous was the change, loquacious crow,
  Thy plumage suffer'd,--snowy white to black.
  With silvery brightness once his feathers shone;
  Unspotted doves outvying; nor to those
  Preserving birds the capital whose voice
  So watchful sav'd;--nor to the stream-fond swans,
  Inferior seem'd his covering: but his tongue,
  His babbling tongue his ruin wrought; and chang'd
  His hue from splendid white to gloomy black.

    No fairer maid all Thessaly contain'd,
  Than young Coronis,--to the Delphic god
  Most dear while chaste, or while her fault unknown.
  But Corvus, Phoebus' watchman, spy'd the deed
  Adulterous;--and inexorably bent
  To tell the secret crime, his flight directs
  To seek his master. Him the daw pursues,
  On plumes quick waving, curious all to learn.
  His errand heard, she cries;--"Thy anxious task,
  "A journey vain, pursue not: mark my words;--
  "Learn what I have been;--see what now I am;
  "And hear from whence my change: a fault you'll find
  "Too much fidelity, which wrought my woe.

    "Time was, when Pallas, Ericthonius took,
  "Offspring created motherless, and close
  "In basket twin'd with Attic twigs conceal'd.
  "The charge to keep, three sister-maids she chose,
  "Daughters of Cecrops double-form'd, but close,
  "Conceal'd what lodg'd within; and strict forbade
  "All prying, that her secret safe might rest.
  "On a thick elm, behind light leaves conceal'd,
  "I mark'd their actions. Two their sacred charge
  "Hold faithful; Pandrosos, and Herse they:
  "Aglauros calls her sisters cowards weak;
  "The twistings with bold hand unloosening, sees
  "Within an infant, and a dragon stretch'd.
  "The deed I tell to Pallas, and from her
  "My service this remuneration finds:
  "Driven from her presence, she my place supplies
  "Of favorite with the gloomy bird of night.
  "All other birds my fate severe may warn,
  "To seek not danger by officious tales.
  "Pallas, perhaps you think, but lightly lov'd
  "One whom she thus so suddenly disgrac'd.
  "But ask of Pallas;--she, though much enrag'd
  "Will yet my truth confirm. A regal maid
  "Was I,--of facts to all well-known I speak:
  "Coroneus noble, of the Phocian lands
  "As sire I claim. Me wealthy suitors sought--
  "Contemn me not,--my beauty was my bane.
  "While careless on the sandy shore I roam'd,
  "With gentle pace as wont, the ocean's god
  "Saw me and lov'd: persuasive words in vain
  "Long trying, force prepar'd, and me pursu'd.
  "I fled; the firm shore left, and tir'd my limbs
  "Vainly, upon the light soft sinking sand.
  "There to assist me men and gods I call'd;
  "Deaf to the sound was every mortal ear:
  "But by a virgin's cries a virgin mov'd,
  "Assistance gave. Up to the skies my arms
  "I stretch'd; and black my arms began to grow,
  "With waving pinions. From my shoulders, back
  "My robes I strove to fling,--my robes were plumes;
  "Deep in my skin the quills were fix'd: I try'd
  "On my bare bosom with my hands to beat;
  "Nor hands nor naked bosom now were found:
  "I ran; the sand no longer now retain'd
  "My feet, but lightly o'er the ground I skimm'd;
  "And soon on pinions through the air was borne;
  "And Pallas' faultless favorite I became.
  "What now avail to me my pure deserts?
  "Nyctimene, whose horrid crime deserv'd
  "Her transformation, to my place succeeds.
  "The deed so wide through spacious Lesbos known,
  "Ere this has reach'd thee;--how Nyctimene--
  "Her father's bed defil'd,--a bird became.
  "Conscious of guilt, she shuns the sight of man;
  "Flies from the day, and in nocturnal shades
  "Conceals her shame; by every bird assail'd
  "And exil'd from the skies." The crow in rage
  To her still chattering, cry'd;--"May each delay
  "Thy babbling causes, prove to thee a curse.
  "I scorn thy foolish presages,"--and flew
  His journey urging. When his master found,
  He told him where Coronis he had seen
  Claspt by a young Thessalian. Down he dropp'd
  His laurel garland, when the crime he heard
  Of her he lov'd;--his harp away he flung;
  His countenance fell, and pale his visage grew.
  Now with fierce rage his swelling bosom fires;
  His wonted arms he seizes; draws his bow,
  Bent to the horns; and through that breast so oft
  Embrac'd,--th' inevitable weapon drove.
  Deep groan'd the wounded nymph, and tearing out
  The arrow from her breast, a purple flood
  Gush'd o'er her shining limbs. She sighing cry'd,--
  "This fate, O Phoebus, I deserv'dly meet,
  "Were but thy infant born;--two now in one
  "Thy dart has slain!"--She spoke,--her vital blood
  Fast flow'd, and stay'd her voice. A deadly chill
  Seiz'd all her members, now of life bereft.
  Too late, alas! her sorrowing lover mourns
  His cruel vengeance; and himself he hates,
  Too credulous listening, and too soon enflam'd:
  The bird he hates, who first betray'd the deed
  And caus'd him first to grieve: his bow he hates;
  His bowstring; arm; and with his arm the dart,
  Shot vengeful. Fond he clasps her fallen form;
  And strives by skill, by skill too late apply'd
  To conquer fate:--his healing arts he tries,--
  All unavailing. Fruitless he beholds
  His each attempt, and sees the pile prepar'd;
  And final flames her limbs about to burn.
  Then from his deepest bosom burst his groans;
  (For tears on cheeks celestial ne'er are seen,)
  Such groans are utter'd when the heifer sees,
  The weighty mallet, from the right ear pois'd,
  Crush down the forehead of her suckling calf.
  And now his useless odors in her breast
  He pour'd; embrac'd her; to her last rites gave
  Solemnization due. The greedy fires
  His offspring were not suffer'd to consume.
  Snatch'd from the curling flames, and from the womb
  Of his dead mother, he the infant bore
  To double-body'd Chiron's secret cave.
  But bade the self-applauding crow, fill'd big
  With hopes of favor for his faithful tale,
  With snowy-plumag'd birds no more to join.

    Meantime while Chiron, human half, half beast,
  Proud of his deity-descended charge,
  Joy'd in the honor with the task bestow'd:--
  Behold, her shoulders with her golden locks
  Shaded, the daughter of the Centaur comes;
  Whom fair Chariclo, on a river's brink
  Swift-rolling, bore, and thence Ocyrrhoe nam'd.
  She not content her father's arts to know,
  The hidden secrets of the fates disclos'd.
  Now was her soul with fate-foretelling sounds
  Fill'd, and within her fiercely rag'd the god:
  The infant viewing;--"Grow," she said, "apace,
  "Health-bearer through the world. To thee shall oft
  "Expiring mortals owe returning life!
  "To thee 'tis given to render souls again
  "Back to their bodies! Once thou'lt dare the deed;--
  "The angry god's forbidding flames, thy power
  "Further preventing:--and a bloodless corps
  "Heaven-born, thou ly'st;---but what thy body form'd
  "A god becomes,--resuscitated twice.
  "Thou too, my dearest and immortal sire!
  "To ages never-ending, born to live,
  "Shalt wish for death in vain; when writhing sad
  "From the dire serpent's venom in thy limbs,
  "By wounds instill'd. The pitying gods will change
  "Thy destin'd fate, and let immortal die:
  "The triple sisters shall thy thread divide.
  "More yet untold remains;"--Deep from her chest
  The sighs burst forth, and starting tears stream down,
  Laving her cheeks, while thus the maid pursues:
  "The fates prevent me, and forbid to tell
  "What more I would;--all power to speak deny.
  "Those arts, alas! heaven's anger which have drawn,--
  "What were they? Would I ne'er the future knew!
  "Now seems my human shape to leave me. Now
  "The verdant grass a pleasing food appears.
  "Now am I urg'd along the plain to bound;
  "Chang'd to a mare: unto my sire ally'd
  "In form,--but why sole chang'd? my father bears
  "A two-form'd body;"--Wailing thus, her words
  Confus'd and indistinct at length are heard.
  Next sounds are utter'd partly human, more
  A mare's resembling:--then she neighs aloud;
  Treading with alter'd arms the ground: fast join'd
  Her fingers now become: a slender hoof
  Her toes connecting with continuous horn.
  Her head enlarges; and her neck expands;
  Her spreading garment floats a beauteous tail:
  Her scatter'd tresses o'er her shoulders flung,
  Form a thick mane to clothe her spacious neck:
  Her voice is alter'd with her alter'd shape:
  And change of name the wonderous deed attends.

    Deep Chiron mourn'd, O Phoebus, and thy aid
  In vain invok'd; for bootless was thy power
  Jove's mandate to resist; nor if thou could'st
  Then wast thou nigh to help. In Elis far,
  And fields Messenian then was thy abode.
  Then was the time when shepherd-like a robe
  Of skins enwrapp'd thee;--when thy left hand bore
  A sylvan staff;--thy right a pipe retain'd,
  Of seven unequal reeds. While love engag'd
  Thy thoughts, and dulcet music sooth'd thy cares,
  'Tis said, thy herds without their herdsman stray'd,
  Far to the Pylian meadows. These the son
  Of Atlantean Maiae espy'd;
  And, slily driven away, within the woods
  The cattle artful hid. None saw the deed,
  Save one old hoary swain, well known around,
  And Battus nam'd; whose post it was to guard
  The groves, the grassy meads, and high-bred mares
  Of wealthy Neleus. Him the robber fear'd;
  Drew him aside, and coaxing thus address'd;--
  "Whoe'er thou art, good friend, if here perchance,
  "Someone should seek an herd,--say that thou here
  "No herd hast seen;--thou shall not lack reward:
  "Take this bright heifer:"--and the cow he gave.
  The bribe receiv'd, the shepherd thus replies;
  "Friend, thou art safe,--that stone shall sooner speak
  "And tell thy deed than I:"--and shew'd the stone.
  The son of Jove departs, or seems to go;
  But soon with alter'd form and voice returns.
  "Here, countryman," he cries, "hast thou an herd
  "This way observ'd to pass?--no secret keep,
  "To aid the theft; an heifer with a bull
  "Await thy information." Doubly brib'd,
  The hoary rogue betray'd his former trust.
  "Beneath those hills," he said, "the herd you'll find."
  Beneath the hills they were. Loud laugh'd the god
  And cry'd,--"Thou treacherous villain, to myself
  "Wouldst thou betray me? wouldst thou to myself
  "My deeds betray?" And to a flinty stone
  His perjur'd breast he chang'd, which still retains
  The name of Touchstone;--on the harmless rock
  His infamous demerits firmly fix'd.

    Hermes from hence, on waving wings upborne
  Darted, and in his flight beneath him saw
  The Attic pastures,--the much-favor'd land
  Of Pallas; and Lyceum's cultur'd groves.
  It chanc'd that day, as wont, the virgins chaste,
  Bore on their heads in canisters festoon'd,
  Their offerings pure to Pallas' sacred fane.
  Returning thence the winged god espy'd
  The troop, and straight his onward flight restrain'd;
  Wheeling in circles round. As sails the kite,
  Swiftest of birds, when entrails seen from far
  By holy augurs thick beset,--he fears
  A near approach, but circling steers his flight
  On beating wings, around his hopes and round.
  So 'bove the Athenian towers the light-plum'd god
  Swept round in circles on the self-same air.
  As Phosphor far outshines the starry host;
  As silver Cynthia Phosphor bright outshines;
  So much did Herse all the nymphs excel,
  The bright procession's ornament; the pride
  Of all th' accompanying nymphs. Her beauteous mien
  Stagger'd Jove's son, who hovering in the air
  Fierce burns with love. The Balearic sling,
  Thus shoots a ball; quick through the air it flies,
  Warms in its flight, and feels beneath the clouds
  Flames hereto known not. Alter'd now his route
  The skies he leaves, and holds a different flight:
  Nor veils his figure,--such reliance gave
  His beauteous form: and beauteous though that form,
  Yet careful did the god his looks adorn;
  He smoothes his tresses, and his robe adjusts
  To hang in graceful folds, and fair display
  The golden fringe; his round and slender wand,
  Of sleep-procuring, sleep-repelling power,
  His right hand bears; and on his comely feet
  His plumed sandals shine. Within the house
  Three separate chambers were secluded form'd,
  With tortoise and with ivory rich adorn'd.
  Thou, Pandrosos, within the right repos'd;
  And on the left hand thou Aglauros, slept;
  Fair Herse in the midst. Aglauros first
  The god's approach descry'd, and daring ask'd
  Who he?--and what he sought?--To whom the god;
  "Him you behold, who through the air conveys
  "His sire's commands: Almighty Jove that sire.
  "Nor will I feign my errand. So may'st thou
  "True to thy sister prove, and soon be call'd
  "My offspring's aunt. 'Tis Herse draws me here.
  "Help then a lover in his warm pursuit."
  Aglauros bends on Mercury those eyes,
  Which yellow-hair'd Minerva's secret saw;
  And ponderous sums for her assistance claims;
  Driving the god meantime without the gates.
  With angry glare the warlike goddess view'd
  The mercenary nymph, and angry sighs,
  Which shook her bosom heav'd; the AEgis shook,
  On that strong bosom fix'd. Now calls to mind
  Minerva how with hands prophane, the maid
  Her strict behests despising, daring pry'd
  To know her secrets; and the seed beheld
  Of Vulcan, child without a mother form'd:
  Now to her sister and the god unkind;
  Rich with the gold her avarice had claim'd.
  To Envy's gloomy cell, where clots of gore
  The floor defil'd, enrag'd Minerva flew:
  A darkened vale, deep sunk, the cavern held,
  where vivid sun ne'er shone, nor freshening breeze
  Health wafted: torpid melancholy rul'd,
  And sluggish cold; and cheering light unknown,
  Damp darkness ever gloom'd. The goddess here
  In conflict dreaded came, but at the doors
  Her footsteps staid, for entrance Fate forbade.
  The gates she strikes--struck by her spear, the gates
  Wide open fly, and dark within disclose,
  On vipers gorging, (her accustom'd feast,)
  The envious fiend: back from the hideous sight
  Recoils the goddess, and averts her eyes.
  Slow rising from the ground, her half chew'd food
  She quits, advancing indolently forth:
  The maid, in warlike brightness clad, she saw,
  In form divine, and heavy sighs burst forth
  Deep from her bosom's black recess: pale gloom.
  Dwells on her forehead; lean her fleshless form;
  Askaunce her eyes; encrusted black her teeth;
  Green'd deep with gall her breasts; her hideous tongue
  With poisons lurid; laughter knows her not,
  Save woes and pangs unmerited she sees;
  Sleep flies her couch, by cares unceasing wrung;
  At men's success she sickens, pining sad;
  But stung herself, while others feel her sting
  Her torture closely grasps her.--Much the maid
  The sight abhors; and thus in brief she speaks:--
  "Deep in the breast of Cecrops' daughter fix
  "Thy venom'd sting--Aglauros is the nymph.--
  "More needs not."--Speaking so Minerva fled,
  Upbounding, earth she with her spear repell'd.
  Glancing asquint the fury saw her rise,
  And inly groan'd,--that she success should gain.
  Her staff with prickly thorns enwreath'd she takes,
  And forth she sallies, wrapp'd in gloomy clouds.
  Where'er she flies she blasts the flowery fields;
  Consumes the herbage; and the harvest blights.
  Her breath pestiferous felt the cities round,
  Houses and 'habitants where'er she flew.
  At length the towers of Athens she beheld
  With arts and riches flourishing, and blest
  With holy peace. Scarce could she tears withhold,
  No tearful eye throughout the place to see.
  Straight to the room of Cecrops' daughter now
  Her route she urges, and her task performs:
  Her rusty hand upon the maiden's breast
  She plants, and with sharp thorns that bosom fills;
  Breathes noxious poison through her frame; imbues
  With venom black her heart, and all her limbs.
  Lest from her eyes escap'd, the maddening scene
  Should cease to vex her, full in view she plac'd
  Her sister, and her sister's nuptial rites;
  And Hermes beauteous in the bridal pomp:
  In beauty all, and splendor all increas'd.
  Mad with the imag'd sight, the maid is gnawn
  With secret pangs;--deep groans the lengthen'd night,
  And deep the morning hears; she wastes away
  Silently wretched, lingeringly slow.
  As Sol's faint rays the summer ice dissolves:
  So burns she to behold the envy'd lot
  Of Herse; not with furious flames,--as weeds
  Blaze not when damp, but with slow heat consume.
  Oft would she wish to die: and oft the deed
  To hinder, thinks to tell her rigid sire
  Her sister's fault. At length her seat she takes
  Across the threshold, and th' approaching god
  Repuls'd; and to his blandishments, and words
  Beseeching fair, and soft-alluring prayers,
  She cry'd,--"Desist,--from hence I ne'er will move
  "Till thou art driven away." Swift Hermes said.--
  "Keep firmly that resolve." And with his wand
  The sculptur'd portals touching, wide they flew.
  But when her limbs to raise, the virgin strove,
  A weighty numbness o'er the members crept
  Which bend in sitting, and their movement staid.
  Strenuous she strives to raise her form erect,
  But stiffen'd feels her knees; chill coldness spreads
  Through all her toes; and, fled the purple stream,
  Her veins turn pallid: cruel cancer thus,
  Disease incurable, spreads far and wide,
  Sound members adding to the parts diseas'd.
  So gradual, o'er her breast the chilling frost
  Crept deadly, and the gates of life shut close.
  Complaint she try'd not; had she try'd, her voice
  Had found no passage, for the stone had seiz'd
  Her throat,--her mouth; to marble all was chang'd.
  She sat a pallid statue;--all the stone
  Her envy tainted with a livid hue.

    His vengeance, when Jove's son complete had seen,
  Due to her avarice, and her envious soul;
  He left Minerva's land, and up the sky
  On wafting pinions mounted. There his sire,
  Him from th' assembly drew; nor yet disclos'd,
  The object of his love:--"Son, quickly haste,--
  "Thou faithful messenger of my commands,
  "Urge rapid thy descending flight, and seek
  "The realm whose northern bounds thy mother star
  "O'erlooks,--the land by natives Sidon call'd.
  "There wilt thou pasturing find the royal herd,
  "'Neath hills not distant from the sea: turn down
  "This herd to meadows bordering on the beach."
  He said;--the cattle tow'rd the sea shore move,
  Where sported with her Tyrian maids as wont,
  The monarch's daughter. Ill majestic state
  And love agree; nor long combin'd remain.
  The sire and ruler of the gods resigns
  His weighty sceptre: he whose right hand bears
  The three-fork'd fires; whose nod creation shakes,
  Assumes a bull's appearance:--with the herd
  Mingles; and strolling lets the tender shrubs
  Brush his fair sides. Of snowy white his skin;
  Such snow as rugged feet has never soil'd,
  Nor southern showers dissolv'd: his brawny neck,
  Strong from his shoulders stands: beneath extends
  The dewlap pendulous: small are his horns;
  But smooth as polish'd by the workman's hand;--
  Pellucid as the brightest gems they shine:
  No threatenings wear his brow; no fire his eyes
  Flame fierce; but all his countenance peace proclaims.
  Him much Agenor's royal maid admir'd;--
  His form so beauteous, and his look so mild.
  Yet peaceful as he seem'd, she fear'd at first
  A close approach;--but nearer soon she drew,
  And to his shining mouth the flowery food
  Presented. Joy'd th' impatient lover stands,
  Her fingers kissing; and with sore restraint
  Defers his look'd for pleasures. Sportive now
  He wantons, frisking in the grass; now rolls
  His snowy sides upon the yellow sand.
  Her apprehensions chas'd, by slow degrees,
  The virgin's fingers playful stroke his breast;
  Then bind with wreaths his horns: more daring now
  Upon his back the royal maid ascends;--
  Witless a god she presses. From the fields,
  His steps deceitful gradual turn'd, he bends,
  And seeks the shore; then playful in the waves
  Just dips his feet;--thence plunging deep, he swims
  Through midmost ocean with his ravish'd prize.
  Trembling the nymph beholds the lessening shore;----
  Firm grasps one hand his horn; upon his back,
  Secure the other resting: to the wind,
  Her fluttering garments floating as she sails.

THE *Third Book* OF THE METAMORPHOSES OF OVID.


    And now the god, his bestial form resign'd,
  Shone in his form celestial as he gain'd
  The Cretan shore. Meantime, the theft unknown,
  Mourn'd her sad sire, and Cadmus sent to seek
  The ravish'd maid; stern threatening as he went,
  Perpetual exile if his searching fail'd:--
  Parental love and cruelty combin'd!
  All earth explor'd in vain, (for who shall find
  The amorous thefts of Jove?) the exile shuns
  His father's anger, and paternal soil.
  A suppliant bends before Apollo's shrine,
  To ask his aid;--what region he should chuse
  To fix his habitation. Phoebus thus;--
  "A cow, whose neck the yoke has never prest,
  "Strange to the crooked plough, shall meet thy steps,
  "Lone in the desert fields: the way she leads
  "Chuse thou,--rand where upon the grass she rests,
  "Erect thy walls;--Boeotia call the place."
  Scarce had the cave Castalian Cadmus left,
  When he an heifer, gently pacing, spy'd
  Untended; one whose neck no mark betray'd
  Of galling service. Closely treads the youth,
  Slow moving in her footsteps, and adores
  In silence Phoebus, leader of his way.
  Now had he pass'd the Cephisidian stream,
  And meads of Panope, when stay'd the beast;
  Her broad front lifted to the sky; reverse
  Her lofty horns reclining, shook the air
  With lowings loud; back then her face she bent,
  And saw the comrades following close behind:
  Down low she couch'd, and press'd the yielding grass,
  Glad thanks to Phoebus, Cadmus gave, and kiss'd
  The foreign soil;--the unknown hills, and land
  Saluted. Then a sacrifice to Jove
  Preparing, sent his followers to explore
  Streams flowing from the living fountain clear.

    An ancient forest hallow'd from the axe,
  Not far there stood; in whose dark bosom gloom'd
  A cavern:--twigs and branches thick inwove
  With rocky crags, a low arch'd entrance form'd;
  Where pure and copious, gush'd transparent waves.
  Deep hid within a monstrous serpent lay,
  Sacred to Mars. Bright shone his crested head;
  His eyeballs glow'd with fire; his body swell'd
  Bloated with poison; o'er a threefold row
  Of murderous teeth, three quivering tongues he shook.
  This grove the Tyrians with ill-fated feet
  Now enter'd; and now in the waters threw,
  With noisy dash, their urns. Uprears his head,
  The azure serpent from the cavern deep;
  And breathes forth hisses dire: their urns they drop;
  The blood forsakes their bodies; sudden fear
  Chills their astonish'd limbs. He writhing quick,
  Forms scaly circles; spiral twisting round,
  Bends in an arch immense to leap, and rears
  In the thin air erect, 'bove half his height;
  All the wide grove o'erlooking. Such his size,
  Could all be seen, than that vast snake no less,
  Whose huge bulk lies the Arctic bears between.
  The Tyrians quick he seizes; some their arms
  Vain grasping,--flying some,--and some through fear
  To fight or fly unable:--these his jaws
  Crash murderous; those his writhing tail surrounds;
  Others his breath, with poison loaded, kills.

    Now loftiest Phoebus shorten'd shadows gave,
  When Cadmus, wondering much why still his friends
  Tarried so long, their parting footsteps trac'd.
  His robe an hide torn from a lion's back;
  A dart and spear of shining steel his arms;
  With courage, arms surpassing. Now the grove
  He enters, and their breathless limbs beholds;--
  Their victor foe's huge bulk upon them stretch'd;
  Licking with gory tongue their mournful wounds.
  "My faithful friends," he cry'd, "I will avenge
  "Your fate,--or perish with you." Straight a rock
  His right hand rais'd, and with impetuous force,
  Hurl'd it right on. A city's lofty walls
  With all its towers, to feel the blow had shook!
  Yet lay the beast unwounded; safely sheath'd
  With scaly armour, and his harden'd hide:--
  His skin alone the furious blow repell'd.
  Not so that hardness mocks the javelin,--fixt
  Firm in the bending of the pliant spine
  His weapon stood,--and all the iron head
  Deep in his entrails sunk. Mad with the pain,
  Reverse he writhes his head;--beholds the wound;
  Champs the fixt dart;--by many forceful tugs
  Loosen'd at length, he tears the shaft away;
  But deep the steel within his bones remains.
  Now to his wonted fury fiercer flames
  This torture adding, big with poison swells
  His throat; and flowing, round his venom'd jaws,
  White foam appears; deep harrow'd with his scales
  Loud sounds the earth; and vapours black, breath'd out
  His mouth infernal, taint with death the air.
  Now roll'd in spires, he forms an orb immense:
  Now stretch'd at length he seems a monstrous beam:
  Now rushing forward with impetuous force,
  As sweeps a torrent swell'd by rain, his breast
  Bears down th' opposing forest. Cadmus back
  A step recedes, and on his lion's hide
  The shock sustains;--then with protended spear
  Checks his approaching jaws. Furious he strives
  To wound the harden'd steel;--on the sharp point
  He grinds his teeth: now from his poisonous mouth,
  Began the blood to flow, and sprinkling ting'd
  The virid grass; but trivial still the hurt;
  For shrinking from the blow, and twisting back
  His wounded neck, the stroke he still prevents
  Deeper to pierce, by yielding to its force.
  But pushing arduous on, Agenor's son,
  Fix'd in his throat the steel;--and the sharp point
  Forc'd through his neck: an oak oppos'd behind;--
  The tree and neck the spear at once transfix'd.
  Dragg'd by the monster's weight low bends the tree,
  And groans and cracks, as lashing blows, his tail
  Immense, deals round. Now whilst the victor stands
  And wondering views the conquer'd serpent's size,
  Sudden a voice is heard, (from whence unknown,--
  But plain the words he hears) "Why view'st thou thus,
  "Agenor's son, the foe by thee destroy'd?
  "Thou one day like this serpent shalt be seen."
  Aghast he stood,--the warm blood fled his cheeks;
  His courage chang'd to terror; freezing fear
  Rais'd his stiff locks erect. Lo! Pallas comes,
  Pallas, the known protectress of the brave.
  Smooth sliding from the higher clouds she comes;
  Bids him remove the soil, and place beneath,
  The serpent's fangs, a future offspring's pledge.
  The prince obeys; and as with crooked share,
  The ground he opens, in the furrows throws
  The teeth directed. Thence, (beyond belief!)
  The clods of earth at once began to move;
  Then in the furrows glitter'd, first, the points
  Of spears: anon fair painted crests arose,
  Above bright helmets nodding: shoulders next;
  And breasts; and arms, with javelins loaded came:
  Thickening the harvest grew of shielded men.
  Thus shews the glad theatric curtain; rais'd
  The painted figures' faces first appear,
  Gradual display'd; and more by slow degrees;
  At length the whole stand forth, their feet all fix'd
  Firm on the lower margin. Wondering, he
  His new-made foe beheld; and grasp'd his arms.
  But one whom earth had just produc'd, exclaim'd;--
  "Arm not, nor meddle in our civil broils."
  He said,--an earth-born brother, hand to hand
  With sword keen-edg'd attacking; but from far,
  A javelin hurl'd, dispatch'd him. Short the boast
  Of him who sent it;--his death wound infix'd,--
  He breathes the air out he so late receiv'd.
  So rage the rest, and in the furious war
  The new-made brethren fall by mutual wounds:
  And on their blood-stain'd mother, dash, the youths
  To short existence born, their damp cold breasts.
  Five only stand unhurt,--Echion one,--
  Who threw, by Pallas prompted, down his arms
  And peace propos'd: his brethren took his pledge.
  These join the Tyrian prince, and social aid
  His efforts, when th' appointed walls he builds;
  Obedient to the Delphic god's commands.

    The Theban walls now rais'd, thou, Cadmus seem'd
  Blest in thy exile. Mars and Venus gave
  Their daughter to thy wife. This spouse so fam'd,
  Thee daughters brought, and sons,--a numerous tribe;
  And grandsons, pledges dear of nuptial joys,
  Already risen to manhood. But too true
  That man should still his final day expect;
  Nor blest be deem'd till flames his funeral pyre.
  Thy grandson's fate, O, Cadmus! first with grief
  Thy bosom wrung, amid thy prosperous state:
  The alien horns which nodded o'er his brow;
  And ye, voracious hounds, with blood full-gorg'd,
  Your master's life-stream. Yet by close research,
  We find unlucky chance, not vice, his crime.
  What sin in error lies?

                         The hills were drench'd
  With blood of numerous slaughter'd savage beasts;
  And objects shorten'd shadows gave: the sun
  Exalted view'd each equi-distant goal;
  When the young Theban hunter thus address'd,
  His fellow sportsmen with a friendly call;
  As wide they rov'd the savage lairs among.
  "Our weapons, comrades, and our nets are moist
  "With blood of spoil; sufficient sport this day
  "Has given. But when Aurora next appears,
  "High on her saffron car, and light restores,
  "Then be our pleasing exercise resum'd.
  "Now Phoebus, distant far from west and east,
  "Cracks the parch'd ground with heat;--desist from toil,
  "And fold your knotted snares." His words obey,
  His men, and from their sportive labor cease.

    Near stood a vale, where pointed cypress form'd
  With gloomy pines a grateful shade, and nam'd
  Gargaphie;--sacred to the girded maid:
  Its deep recess a shrubby cavern held,
  By nature modell'd,--but by nature, art
  Seem'd equall'd, or excell'd. A native arch
  Of pumice light, and tophus dry, was form'd;
  And from the right a stream transparent flow'd,
  Of trivial size, which spread a pool below;
  With grassy margin circled. Dian' here,
  The woodland goddess, weary'd with the chace,
  Had oft rejoic'd to bathe her virgin limbs.
  As wont she comes;--her quiver, and her dart,
  And unstrung bow, her armour-bearing nymph
  In charge receives. Disrob'd, another's arms
  Sustain her vest. Two from her feet unloose
  Her sandals. Crocale, Ismenian nymph,
  Than others more expert, her tresses binds,
  Loose o'er her shoulders floating, in a knot;
  Her own wild flowing still. Five more the streams
  In huge urns lifting; Hyale, and Niphe,
  Phiale, Rhanis, Psecas, lave her limbs.
  Here while the goddess in the limpid wave
  Washes as 'custom'd,--lo! Actaeon comes;--
  His sportive toil till morning dawn deferr'd:
  And roving through the vale with random steps,
  By hapless fate conducted, he arrives
  Close to the sacred grove. Within the grot
  Stream-pouring, when he stept, the naked nymphs,--
  Then first by man beheld,--their bosoms beat;
  Fill'd the deep grove with outcries loud; and round
  Diana crowded, screening as they could
  Her limbs with theirs. Yet high above them tower'd
  The goddess, and her neck their heads o'erlook'd.
  As blush the clouds by Phoebus' adverse rays
  Deep ting'd;--or as Aurora in the morn;
  So blush'd the virgin-goddess, seen unrob'd.
  Sideway she stood, though closely hemm'd around
  By clustering nymphs, and backward bent her face:
  Then anxious praying she could reach her darts,
  In vain,--she seiz'd the waters which she could,
  And dash'd them o'er his features:--as his locks,
  The vengeful drops besprinkled, thus in rage,
  She cry'd,--"Now tell thou hast Diana seen
  "Disrob'd;--go tell it, if thou canst,"--no more,
  With threatenings storm'd, but on his sprinkled head,
  The antlers of the long-liv'd stag are plac'd.
  His neck is lengthen'd; with a sharpen'd point,
  His upright ears are form'd; to feet his hands,--
  To long and slender legs his arms are chang'd;
  And round his body clings a dappled coat.
  Fear in his bosom she instils: the youth,
  The bold Actaeon flies, and wondering feels
  His bounding feet so rapid in the race.
  But soon the waters shew'd his branching horns;
  And,--"ah unhappy me!" he strove to cry:
  His voice he found not; sighs and sobs were all;
  And tears fast streaming down his alter'd face.
  Still human sense remains. Where shall he turn?
  His royal palace seek,--or in the woods
  Secluded hide?--To tarry fear forbids,
  And shame prevents returning. While he doubts
  His hounds espy him. Quick-nos'd Tracer first,
  And Blackfoot give the signal by their yell:
  Tracer of Crete, and Blackfoot Spartan bred.
  Swifter than air the noisy pack rush on;
  Arcadian Quicksight; Glutton; Ranger, stout;
  Strong Killbuck; Whirlwind, furious; Hunter, fierce;
  Flyer, swift-footed; and quick-scented Snap:
  Ringwood, late wounded by a furious bear;
  And Forester, by savage wolf begot:
  Flock-tending Shepherdess; with Ravener fierce,
  And her two whelps; and Sicyonian Catch:
  The thin flank'd greyhound, Racer; Yelper; Patch;
  Tiger; Robust; Milkwhite, with snowy coat;
  And coalblack Soot. First in the race, fleet Storm;
  Courageous Spartan Swift; and rapid Wolf;
  Join'd with his Cyprian brother, Snatch, well mark'd
  With sable forehead on a coat of white:
  Blackcoat: and thickhair'd Shag: Worrier; and Wild,--
  Twins from a dam Laconian sprung, their sire
  Dictaean: Babbler with his noisy throat:--
  But all to name were endless. Urg'd by hope
  Of prey they crowd; down precipices rush;
  O'er rocks, and crags; through rugged paths, and ways
  Unpass'd before. His hounds he flies, where oft
  His hounds he had pursu'd. Poor wretch! he flies
  His own domestics, striving hard to call,
  "Actaeon am I!--villains, know your lord."
  Words aid him not: loud rings the air with yells,
  Howlings, and barkings:--Blackhair first, his teeth
  Fix'd in his back; staunch Tamer fasten'd next;
  And Rover seiz'd his shoulder: tardy these,
  The rest far left behind, but o'er the hills
  Athwart, the chase they shorten'd. Now the pack,
  Join'd them their lord retaining; join'd their teeth
  Their victim seizing:--now his body bleeds,
  A wound continuous: deep he utters groans,
  Not human, yet unlike a dying deer;
  And fills the well-known mountains with his plaint.
  Prone on his knees in suppliant form he bends;
  And low beseeching waves his silent head,
  As he would wave his hands. His witless friends,
  The savage pack with joyous outcries urge;
  Actaeon anxious seeking: echoing loud
  Eager his name as absent. At the name,
  His head he turns. His absence irks them sore,
  As lazy loitering, not the noble prey
  Obtain'd, beholding. Joyful could he be,
  At distance now,--but hapless is too near:
  Glad would he see the furious dogs their fangs,
  On other prey than his torn limbs infix.
  On every side they crowd; their dying lord,
  A well-seem'd deer, they rend; their ravenous teeth
  Deep tear his members. With a thousand wounds,
  (Dian's insatiate anger less despis'd)
  The hapless hunter yielded forth his breath.

    Report flies dubious; some the goddess blame
  For disproportion'd vengeance; others warm
  Applaud the deed as worthy one so pure;
  And reasons weighty either party urge:
  Jove's consort only silent: she nor blames
  The action, nor approves; but inward joys,
  Agenor's house should such misfortune feel.
  The hatred nourish'd for the Tyrian maid,
  Her brother's offspring visits. Now fresh cause
  Of wrath succeeds; enrag'd the goddess learns
  That Semele, embrac'd by mighty Jove,
  Is pregnant. Straight broke loose her angry tongue,
  And loud she storm'd:--"Advantage much I gain
  "By endless railing at unfaithful Jove!
  "This harlot will I find,--and, if with truth
  "They potent Juno stile me, she shall die.
  "Destruction shall o'erwhelm her, if beseems
  "My hand the sparkling sceptre of the sky:
  "If queen I am to Jove;--if sister;--wife:--
  "His sister doubtless am I, if no more.
  "Content perchance is Semele to joy
  "In pleasures briefly tasted; and my wrongs
  "Though deep, not lasting. No!--she must conceive
  "Foul aggravation of her shameless deed!
  "Her swelling womb unblushing proves her crime:
  "By Jove she longs to be a mother hail'd;
  "Which scarcely I can boast. Such faith her pride,
  "In conscious beauty places. Trust me not,
  "Or she mistaken proves. As I am child
  "Of hoary Saturn, she shall sink o'erwhelm'd
  "By her own Jove; and dip in Stygian waves."

    She said, and starting from her regal throne,
  Wrapt in a dusky cloud descended; o'er
  The threshold stepp'd of Semele, nor chas'd
  Her darkening veil, till like an ancient dame
  She stood display'd. White hairs her temples strew'd;
  Deep furrows plough'd her skin; her bending limbs
  Quiver'd beneath her weight; her tremulous voice
  Exhausted age betray'd: she stood to view
  Old Beroe, from Epidaurus come,
  The nurse of Semele. With tedious tales
  She garrulous amus'd:--when in her turn
  Listening, the name of Jupiter she heard
  She sigh'd, and said,--"May he be truly Jove!
  "But age is still suspicious. Chastest beds
  "Have been by these pretended gods defil'd:
  "For if the deity supreme he be,
  "Why comes he thus disguis'd? If true his love,
  "Why prove it not? Urge thou an anxious wish
  "To clasp him in his might, in such a sort,
  "As lofty Juno he embraces;--round
  "Begirt with all the ensigns of his power."
  Thus Juno artful, Semele's desires
  Apt moulded to her mind. From Jove she prays
  A nameless boon: the ready god consents;--
  "Chuse what thou wilt, nor least denial dread:
  "To prove my faith, I call the Stygian streams
  "To witness, terror of the god of gods."
  Joy'd at her fatal prayer's too large success;
  And by her lover's prompt compliance, doom'd
  To sure destruction;--"This," said she, "I wish;--
  "When with me next you love's delights enjoy,
  "Appear as when Saturnia fills your arms."
  Fain would the god have stopp'd her mouth:--too soon
  The hasty words found entrance to his ears.
  Deep mourn'd he. Equal now the fates forbid,
  The wish retracted, or the oath absolv'd.
  Sorrowing he seeks the lofty heaven: his nod
  Dark rolling clouds collects: here form black showers;
  And hurricanes; and flashing lightenings mixt;
  Thunders; and his inevitable bolt:
  Anxious he strives with all his power to damp,
  The fierceness of his flames: nor arm'd him now,
  With those dread fires that to the earth dash'd down
  The hundred-handed foe:--too powerful they.
  He chose a milder thunder;--less of rage,
  Of fire, and fury, had the Cyclops given
  The mass when forg'd; a second-rated bolt.
  Clad in mild glory thus, the dome he seeks
  Of Semele;--her mortal frame too weak,
  To bear th' ethereal shock, fierce scorcht she sunk,
  Beneath the nuptial grant. Th' imperfect babe,
  Snatcht from his mother's smoking womb, was sew'd
  (If faith the tale deserves) within his thigh;
  There to complete the period of his growth.
  Ino, his aunt maternal, then receiv'd
  The boy; in private rear'd him, till the nymphs
  Of Nysa's mountains, in their secret caves
  Shelter'd, and fed with milk, th' entrusted charge.

    While the rash promise caus'd on earth those deeds,
  And twice-born Bacchus' cradle safe was hid;
  'Tis said that Jove with heavenly nectar flush'd,
  All serious cares dismiss'd. With sportive jests,
  At ease conversing, he and Juno sate:
  When he:--"The thrilling ecstasies of love,
  "Are surely strongest on the female side."
  She differs,--and the question both agree
  Tiresias, who each sex had prov'd, shall judge.
  Two mighty snakes he spy'd upon the grass,
  Twisted in Venus' wreaths; and with his staff
  Hard smote them;--instant alter'd was his sex.
  Wonderous! he woman of a man became,
  Seven winters so he liv'd:--the eight, again
  He spy'd the same; and cry'd,--"If such your power,
  "That whoso strikes you must their gender change,
  "Once more I'll try the spell." Straight as the blow
  The snakes receiv'd, his pristine form return'd:
  Hence was he chosen, in the strife jocose,
  As umpire; and the words of Jove confirm'd.

    Much, say they, Juno rag'd; more than beseem'd
  The trivial cause, or sentence justly given;
  And veil'd the judge's eyes in endless night.
  But Jove omnipotent, him gave to know,
  (For fate forbids to cancel others' deeds)
  What future times conceal; a light divine;
  An honor'd gift to mitigate his pain.

    Fam'd far and wide through all Boeotia's towns,
  Unerring answers still the prophet gave,
  To all who sought him. Blue Liriope,
  First prov'd his faith, and ne'er-deceiving words.
  Her once Cephisus, in his winding stream
  Entwin'd, and forceful in his waves enjoy'd.
  The beauteous nymph's full womb, in time produc'd
  A babe, whose features ev'n from birth inspir'd
  Th' attendant nymphs with love; Narcissus nam'd.
  For him enquiring, whether doom'd to see,
  The peaceful period of maturest age,
  The fate-foretelling prophet thus reply'd:--
  "Yes,--if himself he never knows." The words
  Were long absurd esteem'd: but well th' event
  Their justice prov'd; his strange unheard of death;
  And love of object never lov'd before.

    Now sixteen summers had Narcissus seen,
  A boy in beauty, but in growth a man;
  And crowds of youths his friendship sought, and crowds
  Of damsels sought his love: but fiercely pride
  Swell'd in his snowy bosom; and he spurn'd
  His friends' advances, and the love-sick maids.
  A chattering nymph, resounding Echo, saw
  The youth, when in his toils the trembling deer
  He drove;--a nymph who ne'er her words retain'd,
  Nor dialogue commenc'd. But then she bore
  A body palpable; and not, as now,
  Merely a voice:--yet garrulous, she then
  That voice, nor other us'd; 'twas all she could,
  The closing words of speakers to repeat.
  Juno had this ordain'd: for oft the dame
  The frailer nymphs upon the hills had caught,
  In trespass with her Jove; but Echo sly
  With lengthen'd speech the goddess kept amus'd,
  Till all by flight were sav'd. Soon Juno saw
  The trick:--"The power of that delusive tongue,"--
  She cry'd, "I'll lessen, and make brief thy words;"
  Nor stay'd, but straight her threaten'd vengeance took.
  Now she redoubles (all she can) the words
  Which end another's speech; reporting back,
  But only what she hears.

                           Through pathless woods
  As roves Narcissus, Echo sees, and burns;
  Steals in his footsteps, following close, but flames
  More fierce, more near approaching. Sudden thus,
  The sulphurous daubing o'er the torches spread,
  Snatches th' approaching flame. How oft she wish'd
  With bland and soothing words to hail the youth;
  But nature harsh forbids, nor grants to make
  The first commencement; what she grants she takes,
  And anxious waits to catch the wish'd-for sounds;
  And speak responsive. Chance the youth had led
  Far from his social troop, and loud he cry'd,--
  "Who's he that hither comes?" Attentive she,--
  Reply'd, "O hither come!" Amaz'd he stood,
  Round searching whence the voice; and louder still,
  "Here come!" exclaim'd,--and Echo answer'd,--"Come!"
  To every part his eyes in vain are bent;
  And, "why," laments he, "dost thou me avoid?"
  Again he hears her,--"dost thou me avoid?"
  Still he persists; th' alternate voice deceives,--
  And,--"come, approach, together let us join,"
  Impatient now he utters: ardent she
  Exclaims, in joyful accents,--"let us join!"
  Her wish in person urging, from the grove
  She springs, and wide extends her arms to clasp
  His neck:--Narcissus flies, and flying calls,--
  "Desist!--hold off thy hands;--may sooner death
  "Me seize, than thou enjoy me." Nought the maid
  Re-echoes, but,--"enjoy me." Close conceal'd,
  By him disdain'd, amid the groves she hides
  Her blushing forehead, where the leaves bud thick;
  And dwells in lonely caverns. Still her flame
  Clings close around her heart; and sharper pangs
  Repulse occasions: cares unceasing waste
  Her wretched form: gaunt famine shrivels up
  Her skin; and all the moistening juice which fed
  Her body, flies in air: her voice and bones
  Alone are left: her voice, unchang'd;--her bones
  To craggy stones are harden'd. Still in groves
  She hides secluded; nor on hills appears:
  Heard frequent; only heard, and nought but sound.

    Thus slighted he the nymph; nor her alone,
  But numbers else who o'er the mountains rov'd;
  Or sported in the waves. Nor less his pride,
  When more mature: keen smarting from his scorn,
  To heaven one rais'd her hands, and ardent pray'd;--
  "Ordain that he may love, but love like me
  "One ne'er to be enjoy'd!" Rhamnusia grants
  To prayers so just, th' assenting nod. There stood,
  A mudless pool, whose waters silvery bright,
  The shepherds touch'd not,--nor the mountain goats,
  Nor lowing herds: which birds, and fierce wild beasts,
  Dabbling disturb'd not:--nor a wither'd branch,
  Dropt from a tree o'erhanging. Round the brink,
  Fed by the moisture, virid grass arose;
  And trees impervious to the solar beam,
  Screen'd the cool surface. Weary'd with the chase,
  And faint with heat, here laid Narcissus down;
  Charm'd with the place, and tempted by the pool.
  Here as he seeks to quench his burning thirst,
  He burns with other fires: and while he drinks,
  Caught by the image of his beauteous face,
  He loves th' unbody'd form: a substance thinks
  The shadow:--loves enraptur'd,--loves himself!
  Fixes with eager gaze upon the sight
  As on a face in Parian marble wrought.
  Stretcht on the ground, his own bright eyes he views,
  Twin stars;--his fingers, such as Bacchus grace;
  His tresses like Apollo's;--downy cheeks,
  Unbearded yet; his neck as ivory white;
  The roseate blooming fading into snow:
  Each trait admiring which the hapless nymphs,
  In him admir'd. Unwitting youth, himself
  He wants;--at once beloving, and belov'd:
  Himself desiring, by himself desir'd:
  Burning with love, while by himself he burns.
  Oft, stooping, were his fruitless kisses given:
  Oft were his arms outstretch'd to clasp the neck
  So plainly seen beneath the waters. No!--
  Himself he could not clasp. Whom he beholds,
  He knows not; but for whom he sees he burns.
  The error that his eye deceives, provokes
  His rage. O, foolish youth! why vainly grasp
  A fleeting shadow? What thou seek'st is not:--
  And what thou lov'st thou now destroy'st:--thou see'st
  A semblance only;--a reflected shade--
  Nought of itself: with thee it came;--with thee
  It stays;--and with thee, if thou could'st, would go.
  Not hunger's power has force to drag him thence;
  Nor cares of sleep oppress him. Thrown along
  The shaded grass, he bends insatiate eyes
  Tow'rds the fallacious beauty;--by those eyes
  He perishes. Now half-uprais'd, his arms
  Outspread, to all the groves around he cry'd:--
  "Ye woods, whose darken'd shades so oft have given
  "Convenient privacies to lovers, say,
  "Saw you e'er one so cruelly who lov'd?
  "In ages heap'd on ages you have stood,
  "Remember ye a youth who pin'd as I?
  "Pleas'd with the object, I its form behold;
  "But what I see, and what so pleases flies.
  "I find it not: in such bewilder'd maze
  "The lover stands. And what my grief augments,
  "No mighty seas divide us; lengthen'd roads;
  "Nor lofty hills; nor high embattled walls,
  "With portals clos'd: asunder are we held
  "By trivial drops of water. It no less
  "Than I, would give th' embrace; for when I bend
  "My lips to kiss it in the limpid stream;
  "With rising lips to meet, it anxious strives:
  "Then might you think we touch, so faint a line
  "Sunders us lovers. Come! whate'er thou art,
  "Come hither! why thus mock me, dearest form?
  "Why fly my wooing thus? My beauty sure,
  "Nor youth are such as should provoke thy flight:
  "For numerous nymphs for me have burn'd. Some hope
  "Thy kindly sympathizing face affords;
  "And when my anxious arms I stretch,--thy arms
  "Advance to clasp me:--when I smile, thou smil'st:
  "And often have I noted, when the tears
  "Stream'd down my cheeks, a rivulet on thine:
  "I nod,--thou, answering, noddest: and those lips,
  "Those beauteous lips, whose movements plain I see,
  "Words utter sure to mine,--though I forbid,
  "The sounds to hear. In thee am I!--no more
  "My shadow me deceives: I see the whole;
  "Love for myself consumes me:--flames self-rais'd,
  "Myself torment. What hope? be woo'd,--or woo?
  "Wooing, or being woo'd, where is my gain?
  "Myself I wish, and plenty makes me poor.
  "Would that my body from itself could part!
  "Strange wish for lovers, what most dear they love,
  "Absent to pray. Grief undermines my strength;
  "Nor long my life can linger;--immature,
  "In youth I perish: but in me no fears,
  "Can death infuse, of all my woes the end;
  "Might I but leave this lovely object, still
  "Existing: now two images, alas!
  "Sink with one soul in death." Narcissus wails;
  And raving turns to view the face again.
  His tears the waters trouble; and the face
  So beauteous, scarce is seen. Griev'd, he exclaims,
  When disappearing,--"Whither fly'st thou? stay--
  "Stay, I beseech thee; cruel, fly me not,--
  "Thy lover: grant me still to view the form,
  "To touch forbidden:--food, at least, afford
  "To this unhappy flame." Lamenting thus,
  He from his shoulders tore his robe, and beat
  With snow-white hands his bosom; at the blow
  His bosom redden'd: so the cherry seems,
  Here ruddy blushing, there as fair as snow:
  Or grapes unripe, part purpling to the sun,
  In vary'd clusters. This he soon espy'd,
  Reflected in the placid pool; no more
  He bore it, but as gentle fire dissolves
  The yellow wax: as Phoebus' morning beams
  Melt the light hoar;--so wasted he,--by love
  Gradual consum'd, as by a secret fire.
  No more the ruddy teints appear, with white
  Soft blended. All his active strength decays;
  And all that pleas'd so lately. Ev'n his form
  So much by Echo lov'd, no more remains.

    All Echo saw; and though of former slights
  Still mindful, griev'd; and when the hapless youth
  "Alas!" exclaim'd; responsive sigh'd, "Alas!"
  When on his breast the blows resounded; blows
  Loud answering his were heard. His final words,
  Gazing still earnest on the wonted wave,
  Were,--"dearest form, belov'd in vain!"--the words
  Resounded from the grove: "farewel," he cry'd,
  And Echo cry'd, "farewel." Weary'd he threw,
  On the green turf his head. Night clos'd his eyes;
  Their owner fond admiring. Now retir'd
  To regions far beneath, the Stygian lake
  Reflects his form. The Naiaed sisters wail,
  Shorn of their tresses, which to him they throw:
  The Dryads also mourn; their bosoms beat;
  And Echo answers every tearful groan.
  A pile they build; the high-tost torches bring;
  And funeral bier; but, lo! the corpse is gone:
  A saffron-teinted flower alone is found,
  Rising encircled with its snowy leaves.

    Th' adventure spread through all the Achaian towns,
  And much repute th' unerring augur gain'd.
  Great now his prophesying fame. Alone,
  Pentheus despis'd him;--(he the gods despis'd)
  And only he;--he mock'd each holy word
  Sagely prophetic:--with his rayless eyes
  Reproach'd him. Angrily, his temples hoar
  With reverend locks, the prophet shook, and said;--
  "Happy for thee, if thus of light bereft,
  "The Bacchanalian orgies ne'er to see!
  "The day approaches, nor far distant now;
  "My sight prophetic tells,--when here will come
  "Bacchus new-born, of Semele the son,
  "Whose rites, if thou with honor due, not tend'st
  "In temples worthy,--scatter'd far and wide,
  "Thy limbs dismember'd shall the ground bestrew:
  "Thy blood the forests shall distain;--thy gore
  "Thy aunts,--nay e'en thy mother, shall pollute:
  "For thou such honors, as immortals claim,
  "Shalt to the god deny; then wilt thou find
  "Beneath this darkness I but see too well."
  Thus speaking, Echion's son the prophet push'd
  Harshly away; but his too faithful words
  Time prov'd;--the threaten'd deeds accomplish'd all.

    Lo! Bacchus comes, and all the country rings
  With joyous outcries; crowds on crowds thick swarm;--
  Matrons, and wives new-wedded, mixt with men;
  Nobles, and commons; all the impulse bears,
  To join the stranger's rites. But Pentheus thus;--
  "Offspring of Mars! O nation, serpent born!
  "What madness fills your minds? Can piercing sounds
  "Of brass from brass rebounding; winding horns,
  "And magic cheatings, then possess such power?
  "You whom the warlike sword, the trumpet's clang,
  "And battle's edge, dread bristling close with arms,
  "Appal not; yield ye thus to female howls;
  "Wine's maddening fumes; a filthy shameless crowd;
  "And empty cymbals? In amaze, I see,
  "You venerable men who plough'd the seas,
  "And here, a refuge for your exil'd gods,
  "This second Tyre have built,--without a blow,
  "Yield it a spoil! Ye too, robuster youths,
  "Of hardier age, and years more near my own;--
  "Whom warlike arms, than Thyrsi more become;
  "And brows with helmets than with leaves comprest:
  "Think whence you sprang, and let the thought inspire
  "Your souls with all the dragon's fierceness: he
  Singly slew hosts: he for his fountain fell;
  You for your honor vanquish. He destroy'd
  The valiant; you th' effeminate expel;
  And all the glory of your sire regain.
  "If fate to Thebes a speedy fall decrees,
  "May heroes, O, ye gods! with battering force
  "O'erturn her walls;--may the sword rage, and flames
  "Crackling, devour her. Wretched though our lot;
  "Not criminal: our fate, though much bemoan'd,
  "Would need concealment not: tears then might flow,
  "But not from shame. Now unresisting Thebes,
  "Yields to a boy unarm'd; who never joys
  "In armies, steeds, nor swords;--but more in locks
  "With myrrh moist-dropping, garlands soft, and robes
  "Of various teints, with gold and purple gay.
  "Rest ye but tranquil, and without delay,
  "Him will I force to own his boasted sire
  "Untrue; and forg'd those new invented rites.
  "Had not Acrisius bravery to despise
  "The counterfeited deity, and close
  "The gates of Argos on him? And must now
  "This wanderer come, and Pentheus terrify,
  "With all the power of Thebes! Haste, quickly haste,"--
  He bade his servants,--"hither drag, firm chain'd,
  "This leader. Quick, nor brook my words delay!"
  His grandsire, Athamas, and all the crowd
  Reprove;--while thus he rails, with fruitless toil
  Labor to stop him. Obstinate he stands,
  More raging at remonstrance; and his ire
  Restrain'd, increases; goading more and more;
  Restraint itself enkindling more his rage.
  So may be seen a river rolling smooth,
  With murmuring nearly silent, while unchecked;
  But when by rocks, or bulky trees oppos'd,
  Foaming and boiling furious, on it sweeps
  Impetuous raging; fiercer, more withstood.

    With blood besmear'd, his men return;--their lord
  For Bacchus anxious asks;--but Bacchus they,
  To find, arriv'd too late;--"but here," they cry,--
  "Here have we seiz'd his comrade;--one who joins
  "His train, and joins his rites." (The Tuscans once
  The Bacchanalian orgies follow'd.) Bound
  Behind, his hands, their prisoner they present.
  Pentheus survey'd the stranger, while his eyes
  Sparkled with rage terrific: with constraint
  His torture so deferring, thus he spoke;--
  "Wretch! ere thou sufferest,--ere thy death shall give
  "A public warning,--tell thy name;--confess
  "Thy sire; declare thy country; and the cause
  "Those rites thou celebratest in a mode
  "Diverse from others." Fearless, he reply'd;--
  "Acoetes is my name: my natal land,
  "Tyrrhenia: from an humble stock I spring.
  "Lands by strong oxen plough'd, or wool-clad flocks,
  "Or lowing herds my father left me none:
  "For poor was he;--his daily toil to catch
  "With nets and lines the fish, and as they leap'd,
  "Draw with his bending rod the prey to land:
  "His skill his sole estate. When unto me
  "This art he taught,--receive, said he, my wealth;
  "Such wealth as I possess; heir to my toil,
  "And to my toil successor: dying, he
  "To me bequeath'd the waters;--nothing more:
  "These only as paternal wealth I claim.
  "But soon, disliking on the self-same rock
  "To dwell, I learn'd the art to rule the track
  "Plough'd by the keel, with skilful guiding hand;
  "And learn'd th' Olenian sign, the showery goat;
  "Taygete; and the Hyaedes; the Bear;
  "The dwellings of the winds; and every port
  "Where ships could shelter. Once for Delos bound,
  "By chance, the shore of Chios' isle we near'd;
  "And when our starboard oars the beach had touch'd,
  "Lightly I leap'd, and rested on the land.
  "Now, night expir'd, Aurora warmly glow'd,
  "And rousing up from sleep, my men I bade
  "Supplies of living waters bring; and shew'd
  "What path the fountain led to. I meanwhile,
  "A lofty hill ascending, careful mark'd
  "The wish'd-for wind approaching;--loud I call'd
  "My fellows, and with haste the vessel gain'd.
  "Lo! cry'd Opheltes, chief of all my crew,--
  "Lo! here we come;--and from the desart fields,
  "(A prize obtain'd, he thought),--he dragg'd along
  "A boy of virgin beauty tow'rd the sands:
  "Staggering, the youth, with wine and sleep opprest,
  "With difficulty follow'd. Closely I
  "His dress, his countenance, and his gait remark;
  "And all I see, displays no mortal man.
  "Conscious, I speak my comrades thus:--Unknown
  "To me, what deity before us stands,
  "But sure I am, that form conceals a god.
  "O thou! whoe'er thou art, assist us;--aid
  "Our undertakings;--who have seiz'd thee, spare,
  "Unknowing what they did. Bold Dictys cries,--
  "Than whom none swifter gain'd the topmost yards,
  "Nor on the cordage slid more agile down;--
  "Prayers offer not for us. Him Lybis joins;
  "And brown Melanthus, ruler of the helm;
  "Alcimedon unites; Epopeus too,
  "Who rul'd the rowers, and their restings mark'd;
  "(Arduous they urg'd their sinews by his voice)--
  "Nay all Opheltes join,--the lust of gain,
  "So blinded all their judgments. Still I cry;--
  "Ne'er will I yield my vessel to behold
  "Burthen'd with such a sacrilegious load:
  "Pre-eminent is here my right. I stand
  "To those who strive to hoist him in, oppos'd.
  "Bold and outrageous, far beyond the rest,
  "Was Lycabas; from Tuscan shore exil'd
  "For deeds of murderous violence: he grasp'd
  "My throat with force athletic, as I stood,
  "And in the waves had flung me; but sore stunn'd,
  "A cable caught, and sav'd me. Loud the crew
  "The impious deed applauded. Bacchus rose,
  "(The boy was Bacchus!) with the tumult loud
  "Rous'd from his sleep;--the fumes of wine dispell'd,
  "His senses seem'd restor'd. What is't you do?
  "What noise is this? he cry'd;--What brought me here?
  "O, mariners! inform me;--tell me where
  "You carry me! Fear not,--the pilot said,--
  "Say but the port, where most thou'dst chuse to land;--
  "Thither we straight will steer. The god reply'd;--
  "To Naxos then your course direct; that isle
  "My native soil I call:--to you that isle
  "A friendly shore shall prove. False men, they swear,
  "By ocean, and by all the sacred gods,
  "This to perform; and order me to loose,
  "The painted vessel's sails. Full on the right
  "Stood Naxos. Loudly one to me exclaims;
  "As tow'rd the right I trim the sails to steer;--
  "What now, Acoetes? madman! fool! what now?
  "Art thou distracted? to the left we sail.--
  "Most nod significant their wishes: some
  "Soft whisper in my ear. Astounded, I
  "Let others guide!--exclaim,--and quit the helm;
  "Guiltless of aiding in their treacherous guile.
  "Loud murmurings sound from all; and loudly one,
  "Ethalion, cries;--in thee alone is plac'd
  "Our safety, doubtless!--forward steps himself;--
  "My station seizes; and a different course
  "Directs the vessel, Naxos left behind.
  "The feigning god, as though but then, the fraud
  "To him perceptible, the waves beholds
  "From the curv'd poop, and tears pretending, cries;--
  "Not this, O, seamen! is the promis'd shore:
  "Not this the wish'd-for land! What deed of mine
  "This cruel treatment merits? Where the fame
  "Of men, a child deceiving; numbers leagu'd
  "Misleading one? Fast flow'd my tears with his;
  "Our tears the impious mob deride, and press
  "The ocean with their strong-propelling oars.
  "Now by the god himself, I swear, (and none
  "To vows more ready listens) that the tale,
  "Though in appearance credence far beyond,
  "Is strictly true. Firm fixt amid the waves
  "The vessel stands, as in a harbour laid
  "Dry from the ocean! Wondering, they their oars,
  "With strokes redoubled ply; loose to the wind
  "More sails; and with this double aid essay
  "Onward to urge. Their oars with ivy twin'd,
  "Are clogg'd; the curving tendrils crooked spread;
  "The sails with clustering berries loaded hang.
  "His temples girded with a branchy crown,
  "Whence grapes hang dangling, stands the god, and shakes
  "A spear entwisted with the curling vine.
  "Round seem to prowl the tiger, and the lynx,
  "And savage forms of panthers, various mark'd.
  "Up leap'd the men, by sudden madness mov'd;
  "Or terror only: Medon first appear'd
  "Blackening to grow, with shooting fins; his form
  "Flatten'd; and in a curve was bent his spine.
  "Him Lycabas address'd;--what wonderous shape
  "Art thou receiving?--speaking, wide his jaws
  "Expanded; flatten'd down, his nose appear'd;
  "A scaly covering cloth'd his harden'd skin.
  "Lybis to turn the firm fixt oars attempts,
  "But while he tries, perceives his fingers shrink;
  "And hands, now hands no longer, fins he sees.
  "Another round the cordage strives his arms
  "To clasp,--but arms he has not,--down he leaps
  "Broad on his crooked back, and seeks the waves.
  "Forkt is their new-made tail; like Luna's form
  "Bent in the skies, ere half her orb is fill'd.
  "Bounding all round they leap;--now down they dash,
  "Besprinkling wide the foamy drops; now 'merge;
  "And now re-diving, plunge in playful sport:
  "As chorus regular they act, and move
  "Their forms in shapes lascivious; spouting high,
  "The briny waters through their nostrils wide.
  "Of twenty now, (our ship so many bore)
  "I only stand unchang'd; with trembling limbs,
  "And petrify'd with fear. The god himself,
  "Scarce courage in my mind inspires; when thus,--
  "Pale terror from thy bosom drive, and seek
  "The isle of Naxos.--Thither come, I tend
  "On smoking altars, Bacchus' sacred rites."

    Him Pentheus angry stopp'd. "Thy tedious tale,
  "Form'd to divert my rage, in vain is told.
  "Here, men, swift drag him hence!--dispatch his soul,
  "Driven from his body, down to Stygian night;
  "By pangs excruciating." Straight close pent,
  In solid dungeon is Acoetes thrown,
  While they the instruments of death prepare;
  The cruel steel; the flames;--spontaneous fly
  Wide ope the dungeon doors; spontaneous fall
  The fetters from his arms, and freed he goes.
  Stubborn, the son of Echion still persists;
  But sends no messenger: himself proceeds,
  To where Cythaeron, for the sacred rites
  Selected, rings with Bacchanalian songs,
  And outcries shrill. As foams an high-bred steed,
  When through the speaking brass the warlike trump,
  Sounds the glad signal; and with ardor burns
  For battle: so the air, with howlings loud
  Re-echoing, Pentheus moves, and doubly flames
  His rage, to hear the clangor. Clear'd from trees,
  A plain extends, from every part fair seen,
  And near the mountain's centre: round its skirt,
  Thick groves grow shady. Here his mother saw
  His eye unhallow'd view the sacred rites;
  And first,--by frantic madness urg'd,--she first
  Furious the Thyrsus at her Pentheus flung:
  Exclaiming loud;--"Ho, sisters! hither haste!
  "Here stands the furious boar that wastes our grounds:
  "My hand has smote him." Raging rush the crowd,
  In one united body. All close join,
  And all pursue the now pale trembling wretch.
  No longer fierce he storms; but grieving blames
  His rashness, and his obstinacy owns.
  Wounded,--"dear aunt, Autonoe!"--he cries,
  "Help me!--O, let your own Actaeon's ghost
  "Move you to pity!" She, Actaeon's name
  Nought heeding, tears his outstretcht arm away;
  The other, Ino from his body drags!
  And when his arms, unhappy wretch, he tries
  To lift unto his mother, arms to lift
  Were none;--but stretching forth his mangled trunk
  Of limbs bereft;--"look, mother!"--he exclaims.
  Loud howl'd Agave at the sight; his neck
  Fierce grasping,--toss'd on high his streaming locks,
  Her bloody fingers twisted in his hair.
  Then clamor'd loudly;--"joy, my comrades, joy!
  "The victory is mine!" Not swifter sweep
  The winds those leaves which early frosts have nipp'd,
  And lightly to the boughs attach'd remain,
  Than scatter'd flew his limbs by furious hands.

THE *Fourth Book* OF THE METAMORPHOSES OF OVID.


    Warn'd by the dreadful admonition, all
  Of Thebes the new solemnities approve;
  Bring incense, and to Bacchus' altars bend.
  Alcithoe only, Minyaes' daughter, views
  His orgies still with unbelieving eyes.
  Boldly, herself and sisters, partners all
  In impious guilt, refuse the god to own,
  The progeny of Jove. The prophet bids
  Each mistress with her maids, to join the feast:
  (Sacred the day from toil). Their breasts to clothe
  In skins; the fillets from their heads to loose;
  With ivy wreathe their brows; and in their hands
  The leafy Thyrsus grasp. Threatening, he spoke,
  In words prophetic, how th' affronted god
  Would wreak his ire. Matrons and virgins haste;
  Throw by their baskets; quit the loom, and leave
  Th' unfinish'd threads: sweet incense they supply
  Invoking Bacchus by his various names.
  Bromius! Lyaeus! power in flames produc'd!--
  Produc'd a second time! god doubly born!
  Born of two mothers! Nyseus! they exclaim;
  Long-hair'd Thyoneus!--and the planter fam'd
  Of genial grapes! Lenaeus! too, they sing;
  Nyctelius! Elelcus! and aloud
  Iaecchus! Evan! with the numerous names,
  O Liber! in the Grecian land thou hold'st.
  Unwaning youth is thine, eternal boy!
  Most beauteous form in heaven! a virgin's face
  Thou seem'st to bear, when seen without thy horns.
  Stoops to thy arms the East, where Ganges bounds
  The dusky India:--Deity rever'd!
  Thou impious Pentheus sacrific'd; and thou,
  The mad Lycurgus punish'd with his axe:
  By thee the Tyrrhene traitors, in the main
  Were flung: Adorn'd with painted reins, thou curb'st
  The lynxes in thy chariot yok'd abreast:
  Thy steps the Satyrs and Bacchantes tread;
  And old Silenus; who with wine o'ercharg'd,
  With a long staff his tottering steps sustains:
  Or on a crooked ass, unsteady sits:
  Where'er thou enterest shout the joyous youth,
  Females and males immingled: loud the drums
  Struck by their hands resound;--and loudly clash
  The brazen cymbals: soft the boxen flutes
  Deep and melodious sound!

                            Now prays all Thebes
  The god's approach in mildness; and perform
  His sacred rites as bidden. Sole remain
  At home secluded, Minyaes' daughters,--they
  With ill-tim'd industry the feast prophane.
  Busy, they form the wool, and twirl the thread;
  Or to the loom stick close, and all their maids
  Urge to strict labor. One with dexterous thumb
  The slender thread extending, cries;--"while all,
  "Idly, those rites imaginary tend,
  "Let us, whom Pallas, deity more great,
  "Detains, our useful labors lighter make
  "By vary'd converse. Each in turn relate
  "Her tale, while others listen; thus the time
  "Less tedious shall appear." All pleas'd applaud
  The proposition; and her sisters beg
  That she the tales commence. Long she demurs,
  What story first, of those she knew, to tell;
  For numerous was her store. In doubt, thy tale,
  Dercetis Babylonian, to relate,
  Whose form, the Syrians think, with scales is cloth'd;
  The stagnant pools frequenting: or describe
  Thy daughter's change, on waving pinions borne;
  Who lengthen'd age obtain'd, on lofty towers
  Safe dwelling: or of Nais, who the youths
  With magic works, and potent witching words
  To silent fishes turn'd; till she the same
  Vile transformation suffer'd: or the tree,
  Which once in clusters white its berries bore,
  Now blood besprinkled, growing black. This tale
  Most novel, pleas'd the most: and as she spun
  Her slender thread, the nymph the tale began.

    "Thisbe, the brightest of the eastern maids;
  "And Pyramus, the pride of all the youths,
  "Contiguous dwellings held, in that fam'd town,
  "Where lofty walls of stone, we learn were rais'd,
  "By bold Semiramis. Their neighbouring scite,
  "Acquaintance first encourag'd,--primal step
  "To further intimacy: love, in time,
  "Grew from this chance connection; and they long'd
  "To join by lawful rites: but harsh forbade,
  "Their rigid sires the union fate had doom'd.
  "With equal ardor both their minds inflam'd,
  "Burnt fierce; and absent every watchful spy
  "By nods and signs they spoke; for close their love
  "Conceal'd they kept;--conceal'd it burn'd more fierce.
  "The severing wall a narrow chink contain'd,
  "Form'd when first rear'd;--what will not love espy?
  "This chink, by all for ages past unseen,
  "The lovers first espy'd.--This opening gave
  "A passage for their voices; safely through,
  "Their tender words were breath'd in whisperings soft.
  "Oft punctual at their posts,--on this side she,
  "And Pyramus on that;--each breathing sighs,--
  "By turns inhaling, have they mutual cry'd;--
  "Invidious wall! why lovers thus divide?
  "Much were it, did thy parts more wide recede,
  "And suffer us to join? were that too much
  "A little opening more, and we might meet
  "With lips at least. Yet grateful still we own
  "Thy kind indulgence, which a passage gives,
  "And amorous words conveys to loving ears.
  "Thus they loquacious, though on sides diverse,
  "Till night their converse stay'd;--then cry'd, adieu!
  "And each imprinted kisses, which the stones
  "Forbade to taste. Soon as Aurora's fires
  "Remov'd the shades of night, and Phoebus' rays
  "From the moist earth the dew exhal'd, they meet
  "As 'custom'd at the wall: lamenting deep,
  "As wont in murmuring whispers: bold they plan,
  "Their guards evading in the silent night,
  "To pass the outer gates. Then, when escap'd
  "From home, to leave the city's dangerous shade;
  "But lest, in wandering o'er the spacious plains
  "They miss to meet, at Ninus' sacred tomb
  "They fix their assignation,--hid conceal'd
  "Beneath th' umbrageous leaves. There grew a tree,
  "Close bordering on a cooling fountain's brink;
  "A stately mulberry;--snow-white fruit hung thick
  "On every branch. The plot pleas'd well the pair.

    "And now slow seems the car of Sol to sink;
  "Slow from the ocean seems the night to rise;
  "Till Thisbe, cautious, by the darkness veil'd,
  "Soft turns the hinges, and her guards beguiles.
  "Her features veil'd, the tomb she reaches,--sits
  "Beneath th' appointed tree: love makes her bold.
  "Lo! comes a lioness,--her jaws besmear'd
  "With gory foam, fresh from the slaughter'd herd,
  "Deep in th' adjoining fount her thirst to slake.
  "Far off the Babylonian maid beheld
  "By Luna's rays the horrid foe,--quick fled
  "With trembling feet, and gain'd a darksome cave:
  "Flying, she dropp'd, and left her robe behind.

    "Now had the savage beast her drought allay'd,
  "And backward to the forest roaming, found
  "The veiling robe;--its tender texture rent,
  "And smear'd the spoil with bloody jaws. The youth
  "(With later fortune his strict watch escap'd)
  "Spy'd the plain footsteps of a monster huge
  "Deep in the sand indented!--O'er his face
  "Pale terror spread: but when the robe he saw,
  "With blood besmear'd, and mangled; loud he cry'd,--
  "One night shall close two lovers' eyes in death!
  "She most deserving of a longer date.
  "Mine is the fault alone. Dear luckless maid!
  "I have destroy'd thee;--I, who bade thee keep
  "Nocturnal meetings in this dangerous place,
  "And came not first to shield thy steps from harm.
  "Ye lions, wheresoe'er within those caves
  "Ye lurk! haste hither,--tear me limb from limb!
  "Fierce ravaging devour, and make my tomb
  "Your horrid entrails. But for death to wish
  "A coward's turn may serve. The robe he takes,
  "Once Thisbe's, and beneath th' appointed tree
  "Bearing it, bath'd in tears; with ardent lips
  "Oft fondly kissing, thus he desperate cries;--
  "Now with my blood be also bath'd!--drink deep!
  "And in his body plung'd the sword, that round
  "His loins hung ready girt: then as he dy'd,
  "Hasty withdrew, hot reeking from the wound,
  "The steel; and backwards falling, press'd the earth.
  "High spouts the sanguine flood! thus forth a pipe,
  "(The lead decay'd, or damag'd) sends a stream
  "Contracted from the breach; upspringing high,
  "And loudly hissing, as the air it breaks
  "With jets repeated. Sprinkled with the blood,
  "The tree's white fruit a purple tinge receiv'd;
  "Deep soak'd with blood the roots convey the stain
  "Inly, and tinge each bough with Tyrian dye.

    "Now Thisbe comes, with terror trembling still,
  "Fearful, she Pyramus expecting waits:
  "Him seek her beating bosom, and her eyes;
  "Anxious the peril she escap'd to tell.
  "Well mark'd her eyes the place,--and well the tree;
  "The berries chang'd in color, long she doubts
  "The same or no. While hesitating thus,
  "The panting members quivering she beholds,
  "Upon the sanguin'd turf; and back recoils!
  "Paler than box her features grow; her limbs
  "More tremble than when ocean fretful sounds,
  "Its surface briskly by the breezes swept.
  "Nor long the pause, her lover soon is known;
  "And now her harmless breast with furious blows
  "She punishes; her tresses wild she rends;
  "Clasps the lov'd body; and the gaping wound
  "Fills with her tears,--their droppings with the blood
  "Immingling. On his clay-cold face she press'd
  "Her kisses, crying;--Pyramus! what chance
  "Has torn thee from me thus? My Pyramus!
  "Answer me,--'tis thy dearest Thisbe speaks!
  "She calls thee,--hear me,--raise that dying face!
  "At Thisbe's name, his lids, with death hard weigh'd,
  "He rais'd--beheld her,--and forever clos'd.

    "Him dying thus,--her lacerated veil;
  "The ivory scabbard empty'd of its sword;
  "She saw,--at once the truth upon her mind
  "Flash'd quick. Alas! thy hand, by love impell'd,
  "Has wrought thy ruin: but to me the hand,
  "In this, at least, shall equal force display,
  "For equal was my love; and love will grant
  "Sufficient strength the deadly wound to give.
  "In death I'll follow thee; with justice call'd
  "Thy ruin's wretched cause,--but comrade too.
  "Thou whom, but death seem'd capable to part
  "From me, shalt find ev'n death too weak will prove.
  "Ye wretched mourning parents, his and mine!
  "The dying prayers respect of him,--of me:
  "Grant that, entomb'd together, both may rest;
  "A pair by faithful love conjoined,--by death
  "United close. And thou fair tree which shad'st
  "Of one the miserable corse; and two
  "Soon with thy boughs wilt cover,--bear the mark
  "Of the sad deed eternal;--ting'd thy fruit
  "With mournful coloring: monumental type
  "Of double slaughter. Speaking thus, she plac'd
  "The steely point, while yet with blood it smok'd,
  "Beneath her swelling breast; and forward fell.
  "Her final prayer reach'd heaven; her parents reach'd:
  "Purple the berries blush, when ripen'd full;
  "And in one urn the lovers' ashes rest."

    She ceas'd: a silent interval, but short,
  Ensu'd; and next Leuconoe thus address'd
  Her listening sisters:--"Ev'n the sun himself,
  "Whose heavenly light so universal shines,
  "To love is subject: his amours I tell.
  "This deity's keen sight the first espy'd--
  "(For all things penetrating first he sees)
  "The crime of Mars and Venus; sore chagrin'd,
  "To Vulcan he th' adulterous theft display'd,
  "And told him where they lay. Appall'd he heard,--
  "And dropp'd the tools his dexterous hand contain'd;
  "But soon recover'd. Slender chains of brass,
  "And nets, and traps he form'd; so wonderous fine,
  "They mock'd the power of sight: for far less fine,
  "The smallest thread the distaff forms; or line,
  "Spun by the spider, pendent from the roof.
  "Curious he form'd it; at the lightest touch
  "It yielded; each momentum, slight howe'er,
  "Caus'd its recession: this he artful hung,
  "The couch enfolding. When the faithless wife,
  "And paramour upon the bed embrac'd,
  "Both in the lewd conjunction were ensnar'd;
  "Caught by the husband's skill, whose art the chains
  "In novel form had fram'd. The Lemnian god
  "Instant wide threw the ivory doors, and gave
  "Admittance free to every curious eye:
  "In shameful guise together bound they laid.
  "But some light gods, not blaming much the sight,
  "Would wish thus sham'd to lie: loud laugh'd the whole,
  "And long in heaven the tale jocose was told.

    "The well-remember'd deed, the Cyprian queen
  "Retorting, made the god remember too:
  "And him who her conceal'd amours disclos'd,
  "In turn betray'd. What now, Hyperion's son,
  "Avails thy beauty!--or thy radiant flames?
  "For thou, whose fires warm all the wide-spread world,
  "Burn'st with a new-felt heat! Thou, whose wide view,
  "Should every object grasp, with partial ken
  "Leucothoe only see'st! that nymph alone,
  "Attracts those eyes, whose lustre all the world
  "Expect to view. Oft in the eastern skies,
  "More early rising, art thou seen; and oft
  "More tardy 'neath the waves thou sinkest: long
  "The wintry days thou stretchest, with delay
  "Thy object lov'd to see. Meantime pale gloom
  "O'ercasts thy orb; the dullness of thy mind
  "Obstructs thy brightness; and thy rays obscure,
  "Terror in mortal breasts inspire. Not pale
  "Thou fadest, as, when nearer whirl'd to earth,
  "Faint Luna's shadow o'er thy surface glooms:
  "But love, and only love the paleness gives.
  "Her only, now thy amorous soul pursues;
  "Rhodos, nor Clymene, nor Perse fair,
  "Of Colchian Circe mother, tempt thee now;
  "Nor Clytie, whom thy cold neglect still spurns;
  "Yet still she burns to clasp thee: deep she mourns,
  "Stung more acutely by this fresh amour.
  "Now in Leucothoe, every former love
  "Is lost. Leucothoe, whom the beauteous nymph,
  "Eurynome, in odoriferous climes
  "Of Araby brought forth. Full-grown, matur'd,
  "Leucothoe's beauteous form no less surpass'd
  "Her mother's, than her mother's all beside.
  "Her sire, the royal Orchamus (who claim'd
  "A seventh descent from ancient Belus) rul'd
  "The Achaemenian towns. The rapid steeds
  "Of Phoebus pasture 'neath the western sky;
  "Not grass, ambrosia, eating; heavenly food,
  "Which nerves their limbs, faint with diurnal toil,
  "Restoring all their ardor. Whilst the steeds,
  "This their celestial nourishment enjoy;
  "And night, as 'custom'd, governs in her turn;
  "The god the close apartments of his nymph
  "Beloved, enters;--form'd to outward view,
  "Eurynome her mother. Her he saw
  "The slender threads from spindle twirling fine,
  "Illumin'd by the lamp; and circled round
  "By twice six female helpers. Warm he gave
  "As a lov'd daughter, his maternal kiss,
  "And said;--our converse secrecy demands.--
  "Th' attendant maids depart,--nor hinderance give,
  "Loitering, a mother's secret words to hear.
  "When he, the chamber free from spy or guard,
  "Exclaims,--no female I! behold the god,
  "The lengthen'd year who spaces! who beholds
  "Each object earth contains! the world's great eye
  "By which it all surveys. My tender words
  "Believe, I dearly love thee. Pale she look'd,
  "While thus he spoke;--started, and trembling dropp'd
  "Her distaff, and her spindle from her hand
  "Nerveless. But ev'n her terror seem'd to add
  "Fresh beauty to her features. Longer he
  "Delay'd not, but his wonted form assum'd;
  "In heavenly splendor shining. Mild the maid,
  "Won by his beauteous brightness, (though at first,
  "His sudden shape surpriz'd her) sunk beneath
  "The force he urg'd, with unresisting power.

    "The jealous Clytie (who with amorous flame
  "Burn'd for Apollo) urg'd by harlot's rage,
  "Straight to the sire, Leucothoe's crime betray'd;
  "Painting the nymph's misdeed with heighten'd glow.
  "Fierce rag'd the father,--merciless inhum'd
  "Her living body deep in earth! Outstretcht
  "High to the sun her arms, and praying warm
  "For mercy;--he by force, she cry'd, prevail'd!
  "O'er her untimely grave a lofty mound
  "Of sand, her sire uprear'd. Hyperion's son
  "Through this an opening with his beams quick form'd,
  "Full wide for her, her head intomb'd to lift,
  "Once to the light again. Thy bury'd corse
  "No more thou now couldst raise; the ponderous load
  "Of earth prevents thee; and a bloodless mass,
  "Exanimate, thou ly'st! Not deeper grief
  "'Tis said, the ruler of the swift-wing'd steeds,
  "Display'd, when o'er the earth the hapless flames
  "By Phaeton were thrown. Arduous he strives,
  "Her gelid limbs, with all his powerful rays
  "To vivid heat recal: stern fate withstands
  "His utmost urg'd endeavours: bathing then
  "Her pallid corse, and all the earth around
  "With odorous nectar, sorrowing sad he cries;--
  "Yet, shalt thou reach the heavens! And soon began
  "Her limbs, soft melting in celestial dew,
  "With moistening drops of strong perfume to flow:
  "Slowly a frankincense's rooted twigs
  "Spread in the earth,--its top the hillock burst.

    "Angry the god (though violent love the pain
  "Of jealousy might well excuse,--the pain
  "Of jealousy the tale) from Clytie now
  "Abstains; no more in amorous mood they meet.
  "Rash now the deed her burning love had caus'd,
  "Too late she found;--she flies her sister-nymphs;
  "And pining, on the cold bare turf she sits;
  "By day,--by night,--sole shelter'd by the sky;
  "Her dripping tresses matted round her brows:
  "Food,--drink, abhorring. Nine long days she bore
  "Sharp famine, bath'd with dew, bath'd with her tears;
  "Still on the ground prone lying. Yet the god
  "In circling motion still she ardent view'd;
  "Turning her face to his. Tradition tells,
  "Her limbs to earth grew fasten'd: ghastly pale
  "Her color; chang'd to bloodless leaves she stood,
  "Streak'd ruddy here and there;--a violet flower
  "Her face o'erspreading. Still that face she turns,
  "To meet the sun;--though binding roots retain
  "Her feet, her love unalter'd still remains."

    She ended; all their listening ears, well pleas'd,
