CHAPTER X.
SPIEITS.
BEINGS ofamore orlessdistinctly spiritual nature, who
atanyratenever weremen,have theirplaceinthebeliefs and
inthe stories oftheBanks' Islands andtheNew Hebrides
verymuch more than intheSolomon Islands. Koevasi,
already mentioned, inFlorida andKahausibware inSanCris-
tovalbelongtothelattergroup, andmaywellbesupposed
tobethesamepersonage under different names. Both were
never human, yetinsomeway originatorsofthehuman
race;bothwere female, bothsubjects ofstories, notobjectsof
worship. Kahausibware wasaHi'ona, abeingofsuper-
human character, dwelling onthemountain ofBauro, the
central mass ofSan Cristoval, inthetime oftheinfancy
ofthehuman race. Shewas asnake inoutward form.
There wasinthesameplaceawoman, ahumanbeing,the
offspringinsomewayofKahausibware. Inthosedaysall
thefruits oftheearthgrew without labour, and allwasofthe
best;itwasKahausibware whomade men, pigs,andother
animals, cocoa-nuts, fruit-trees, and allthefoodwithwhich the
island isnowfurnished, anddeath hadnotyetappeared. The
woman onedaywent toherwork, and leftherinfant inthe
house inchargeofthespirit snake, whowassomuchannoyed

andstrangledit.Themother came inwhile thefolds ofthe

snake atlastcould bear itnolonger, andcried outweeping-,
'Igo,andwho willhelpyounow ?'Shemade herway
down totheseaaccordingly,andhertrack became awater-
course. Leavingtheisland, sheswam across first toUgi,but
from thence shecould seetheBauro mountain;shewent on
further toUlawa, andthenceagaintothesouth-east endof
Malanta, buteven there inclear weather shecould seeher
former home. Shecrossed therefore toMarau, thesouth-east
partofGuadalcanar nearest toSanCristoval. where theview
ofthemountain ofBauro isshut offbythenearer hills;there
sherests tillthepresent day. Since herdepartureallthings
inSanCristoval have deteriorated. Snakes upon theBauro
mountain arevenerated astheprogenyorrepresentativesof
Kahausibware;buttheyaresimple snakes, andshewasa

IntheBanks* Islands andintheNorthern New Hebrides
thepurely spiritual beings who areincorporealareinnumer-
ableandunnamed. These aretheywhoserepresentative form
isgenerallyastone, whohaunt theplacesthat aresacred
because oftheirpresence, andwho connect themselves with
certain snakes, owls, sharks, andother creatures. There isin
thesethingsamedium ofcommunication with them, and
theyarepowerfultoassist thosewhocanapproach them, and
alsotoinjure men,though theyarenotofamalignantnature.
Theyarecertainlybelieved tohave nobody; yetitis
impossibleforthenatives toconceive ofthem asentirely
without form. Men, therefore, have declared thattheyhave
seensomething, indistinct, withnodefiniteoutline, greylike
dust,vanishingassoon asitwaslookedat,near astone, and
thismusthavebeen aspirit, vui,wui. Butthesameword is
used todescribebeings who arecorporeal, andindividually
known andnamed. The natives willdenythat these have
bodies asmen have, and assert that theyareofthesame
nature asthose which areincorporeal;butyetinthestories
that aretoldaboutthemthey figureasmen,though possessed
ofpowers which men cannever have. Consistencycan

Itisremarkableagainthat ofthese superhuman beings
who arecalled vuiorwuiintheBanks' Islands andNew
Hebrides, andwhose actions arelikethose ofmen, there seem
tobetwokinds ororders. QatintheBanks' Islands stories
andTagarointheNew Hebrides stories move likeheroes or
demigodsamidst alesser folk ofdwarfs and trolls asfullof
mysterious magic powerasthey are,butcomparativelyrude
andeasilydeceived. Theselingeredintheislands when Qat
andhisbrothers andTagaro andhisbrothers leftthem;they
havebeen seen oflateinhuman form, smaller than thenative
people, darker, andwithlong straighthair. Marawa, the
friend ofQat,wasoneofthese.AmanlivinginVanua
Lava butafewyears ago,namedManlepei, goingtothe
river side inearly morning, saw alittleman withlong
hanging hair,andfollowed himupthevalleyinwhich the
river runs,tilltheycame toanarrowgorgeclosedbyarock.
Thevuirapped uponthiswith hishandand itopenedtohim;
and asManlepeifollowed close behind, itshutagain upon

HesaidthathewasMarawa, andthathewouldappear again
totheman ifhewould goback tothevillage andbringhim
money. Manlepei prosperedever afterthrough Marawa's
aid,andhemade nosecret ofthesource ofhisprosperity; he
wasalways readytoreceive moneyfrom hisneighbours on
Marawa's behalf, andtoprocureforthem ashare inhisgood
will. Itisnotlongeither since afemale vuiwith achild

years agoinMota whose father wasavui.Popularstories
shewed howthesebeings were believed tobeathand inthe
affairs ofmen.Awoman workinginhergardenheard a

pulled upacaladium ordugayamanother immediately came

onhispanpipe,the first inhisjealousy conveyed awaythe
gardenand all.Inthese stories, andnodoubt incommon
belief, therewasacertain confusion between thesespiritsand
ghostsofthedeparted.
Some vui, spiritual beings, yetinsomeway corporeal,
figure strangelyinthe stories ofMota asNopitu, and of
Motlav, inanother form ofthesame word, asDemlnt. There
isoften adifficultyinunderstanding what istoldabout them,
because thename Nopituisgiven both tothespirit and to
theperson possessed bythespirit, whoperforms wonders by
thepower andinthename oftheNopitu whopossesseshim.
Such aonewould callhimself Nopitu; rather, speakingof
himself, willsaynot'
I,'but'wetwo,'meaningtheNopitu
inhimandhimself, or'we'when heispossessed bymany.

ButaNopituwould alsomanifest itself inadifferent manner.
Apartywould besitting round anevening fire,andoneof
them would hear avoice asifproceedingfrom histhigh,
saying,'Heream I,givemesome food, Iamhungry.' He
would roast alittle redyam,andwhen itwasdone fold itin

theywould call

toher,and situponherknee;shewould hear itcry
'Mother !Mother !'Shewould knowit,andcarryitin
amatuponherback likeaninfant. Sometimes awoman
would hear aNopitu say'Mother, Iamcomingtoyou,'and
shewould feelthespirit enteringinto her,and itwould be
born afterwards asanordinarychild. Such aone,named
Rongoloa, wasnotlong agostilllivingatMotlav. The
Nopitu,likeotherspirits, were thefamiliarsonlyofthose
whoknew them, and these were often women. Ifaman
wished toknow andbecome known toaNopitu, hegave
moneytosomewoman whoknew thosespirits,andthenone
would come tohim.
TheplaceofQatinthepopularbeliefs oftheBanks' Islands
was sohighand soconspicuousthatwhen thepeoplefirst
became known toEuropeansitwassupposedthathewastheir
god,thesupremecreator ofmenandpigsand food. Itis
certain thathewasbelieved tohavemadethingsinanother
sense from that inwhich men could besaidtomake them.

These arenotserioussayings;but itwasbelieved thatQat
hadmade some creatures and fixed thenatural condition of

Lava, andthatfinally hedepartedfrom theworld. There
arenodoubtmanyofhisfeats andadventures which the
natives have kepttothemselves. Thestory which follows
istranslated, with additions from other sources, from the
Mota ofthe latenative Deacon EdwardWogale, himself
oftheSeperestock.
TheStory ofQat. Qatwas notwithout abeginning1
,
buthehadamother whose name wasQatgoro (otherwise
IroUl),andthismother wasastone that burst asunder and
brought him forth. Hehadnofather, andhewasborn on
theroad. Hegrew upandtalked atonce. Heasked his
mother what hisname was,saying that ifhehadafather or
anuncle onhismother's side,oneofthem would namehim;
then hegavehimself thename ofQat.Hehadbrothers
also. The firstwasTangaro Gilagilala, TangarotheWise,
who understood allthings, and could instruct the rest;
thesecond wasTangaro Loloqong, TangarotheFool,who
wasignorantofeverything, andbehaved likeafool;the
others wereTangaro Siria, Tangaro Nolas, Tangaro Nokalato,
Tangaro Noav, Tangaro Nopatau, Tangaro Noau, Tangaro
Nomatig, Tangaro Novunue, Tangaro Novlog ;eleven of
them, allTangaro,twelve inallwith Qat. Thenames ofthe
lastnine aremadeupofthenames oftheleaves oftreesand
plants, Nettle-leaf, Bread-fruit-leaf, Bamboo-leaf, Cocoa-nut-
leaf, Umbrella-palm-leaf,added toTangaro, which isno
doubt thesame with theTagarooftheNew Hebrides and
theTangaroaofthePolynesians. These allgrewupassoon
astheywere born, andtheytookuptheir abode inthevillage
AloSepere, where their mother, turned intoastone,mayyet
beseen. There Qatbegantomakethings, men, pigs, trees,
rocks, asthefancytookhim. Butwhen hehadmade all
sorts ofthings hestillknew nothow tomakenight, andthe
daytime wasalways light. Then said hisbrothers tohim,
'Hallo !Qat, this isnotatallpleasant,here isnothingbut
day; can'tyoudosomethingforus?' Then, seeking what he
could dowith thedaylight,heheard that there wasnightat
Vava, intheTorres Islands';sohetook apigandtiedit,and

putitinto hiscanoe, and sailed over toVava, where he
bought night, qong,from IQong, Night, who lived there.
Otherssaythathepaddledtothefoot ofthesky,tobuy
nightfrom Night, andthatNight blackened hiseyebrows,
andshowed himsleepthatevening, andtaught him inthe
morning how tomake thedawn. Qatreturned tohisbrothers
with theknowledgeofnight, andwith afowlandother
birds, togivenotice ofthetime forthereturn oflight. So
hebadethempreparethemselvesbed-places ;andthey platted
cocoa-nut fronds andspread them inthehouse. Then forthe
firsttimetheysawthesunmoving andsinkingtothewest,
and called outtoQatthat itwascrawling away.'Itwill
soonbegone,'saidhe;'and ifyouseeachange onthefaceof
theearth, that isnight.' Then heletgothenight.'What
isthiscomingoutofthe sea,'they cried,*andcoveringthe
sky?'*That isnight,'saidhe;'sitdown onboth sides of
thehouse, andwhen youfeelsomethinginyour eyes,liedown
andbequiet.' Presentlyitwasdark,andtheireyesbeganto
blink. 'Qat! Qat! what isthis? shallwedie?''Shut
your eyes,'saidhe;*this isit,gotosleep.' When night had
lasted longenoughthecockbegantocrowandthebirds to
twitter;Qattookapieceofredobsidian andcutthenight
with it1
;thelightoverwhich thenight hadspreaditself
shone forthagain, andOat's brothers awoke. After thishe
occupiedhimselfagaininmaking things.
Accordingto'thestorytoldatLakona, inSanta Maria, Qat
andMarawa(anothervuiwhoherecorrespondstotheSupwe
ofMaewo andAraga)dwelt intheirplaceatMatan, near to
themountain Garat, where thevolcanic fires stillsmoulder.
They twomademen inthisway. Qatcutwood ofdracaena-
trees intoshape ;heformedlegs, arms, trunks, heads, and
added earsandeyes;thenhefittedparttopart,andsixdays
heworked about it.After thishefixed thetime ofsixdays
forthem tocome tolife. Three dayshehidthem away, and

three daysheworked togivethem life.Hebrought them
forth and setthem upbefore hisface;then hedanced to
them andsawthattheymoved alittle;hebeatthedrum for
them, andsawthattheymoved more than before. Thus he
beguiled them into life,sothattheycould stand ofthemselves.
Then hedivided them, settingeachmalebyhimself andgiving
himafemale, andhecalled thetwohusband andwife. Three
women hemade, andthree men. ButMarawa made hisof
another tree,thetavisoviso;heworked atthem sixdays also,
andsetthemup,andbeatthedrum forthem, andgavethem
lifeasOathaddone forhis.Butwhen hesawthemmove
hedugapit,covered thebottom ofitwith cocoa-nut fronds,
andburied hismenandwomen initforsixdays. Thenwhen
hescrapedofftheearth with hishands toviewthem, hefound
them allrotten andstinking;andthiswastheoriginofdeath
among men.
AccordingtothestoryastoldinMota, Qatmademenand
pigsatfirstinthesame form, butonhisbrothersremonstrating
withhimonthesameness ofhiscreatures, hebeatdown the
pigstogoonallfours andmademenwalkupright. Man
wasmade ofclay,theredclayfrom themarshyriverside at
Vanua Lava. The firstwoman wasIroVilgale. Qattookrods
andringsofsupple twigs andfashioned herastheymake
thetallhats fortheqatu,bindingontheringstotherods,and
coveringalloverwith thespathesofsago-palms:hence her
name frommltobind,andgale todeceive. When allwas
finished hesawasmile, andthen heknew that shewasa
living woman.
Qathad,however, awife, afemale vui,IroLeibyname, but
hehadnochildren. Hisbrothers, whohadnowives oftheir
own, envied himthepossessionofthebeautiful HoLei,aswell
asofhisexcellent canoe, andwerealways conspiringtoget
both into theirownhands. When hiswork ofcreation was
completed, Qatproposedtohisbrothers thattheyshould cut
canoes forthemselves, andtheybegantowork, eachchoosing
adifferent kind oftree. Qat cutdown alargetree well
suited foracanoe, andworkedsecretly every day,butmade no

progressinhiswork;every daywhen hereturned towork he
found thewood thathehadchopped away replaced, andthe
treemade solidagain.Atlength oneevening when hehad
finished hisday'swork helaydown towatch, makinghimself
small, andcoveringhimself with alarge chipwhich hedrew
awayfrom the restand hid.Presentlyhesawalittle old
manwithlongwhite haircreepoutoftheground andbegin
toreplacethechips,each intheplacefromwhich ithad

there wasone defectiveplacetowhich thechip belonged
which Qathadhidden, andtheoldmanbegantosearch forit,
andQatwatched. After awhile hesaw itandadvanced to
take it;butQatleapt upfrom underit,lifting uphisshell
axetocuthimdown. ButMarawa, thespider, anothervery
powerful vui,forthiswas he,entreated Qat,'Ah,friend, don't
killme,andIwillmake yourcanoe allright again ;'andhe
worked atit,andsoon finished itwith hisnails1
.When
allthecanoes were finished, Qatbade hisbrothers launch
their own,and aseachwaslaunched helifted hishand, and
onebyonetheysank. Then QatandMarawaappearedin
theonethattheyhadmade, paddling swiftly about, tothe
astonishment ofthebrothers, whohadnotknown thatQathad
evenbeguntowork. Having amused himself with their
mortification, herecovered their canoes forthem inthenight.
After thishisbrothers triedwithmanydeceits todestroy Qat,
sothattheymight possessthemselves ofhiswifeand his
canoe. Onedaythey tookhim tothehole ofaland crab
under astone, which theyhadalreadysoprepared bydigging
under itthat itwasreadytotoppleoveruponhim. Qat
crawled into theholeandbegantodigforthecrab;his
brotherstipped overthestone upon him, and,thinking him
crushed todeath, ranofftoseizeEoLeiandthecanoe. But
Qatcalled onMarawa byname,'Marawa !takemeround about

When hefellasthebranch broke, and astheythoughtwas

Qatwashimself always readytoplaytricks onhisbrothers,
butnotinmalice. Onemoonlight nightheinduced them to

Again theyconsulted howtheymight destroy him, and
determined toentrap himwhilesnaringbirds.They prepared
eachone forhimself hisplaceinanutmeg-tree,each insuc-
cession further andfurther from thevillage, andthetree for
Qatmuch further awaythan all.Then they tookQatout
andshewed him hisplace. Qatmounted into histree,andas
soon ashewasbusy with hissnares hisbrother nearest to

nutmeg-tree instantly grewsolargeinthetrunk that Qat's
arms could neverclasp it,and all itsboughs andbranches
equallyswelled out. ButQatdidnotatfirst discoverthis,
because hewasbusy settinghissnares;hisbrother whohad
laidthespellupon thenutmeg-tree ranback, collectingthe
others ashewent into thevillage ;they seized andcarried
offRoLei,dragged down thecanoe intothe sea,andpaddled
offatonce. Theisland hadalreadysunk outoftheirsight
when theyblew their shelltrumpettoletQatknow thatthey
weregone. When heheard itheknew what hadhappened,
andwould have followed them, butthe size oftheswelled
branches ofthenutmeg-tree made itimpossibleforhim to
descend; hetriedand tried invain,andthen lifteduphis
voice andwept. His friend Marawa, theSpider, heard his
cries,andcame toaskhimwhatwasthematter.'Ican'tget
down,' saidhe;'mybrothers haveplayed methis trick.'
'Down withyou,'saidMarawa, whose hairwasexceedingly
long and loose;andhesentuphishair toQat,who de-
scended byitandranintothevillage. There hefound the
rollers ofhiscanoe aloneremaining, andsoughthiswife in
vain, forhisbrothers hadtaken offhiswifeandhiscanoe to
betheir own. Then Qatwent inside hishouse, andtook his
cock's-tailplume, andhisstringofthesmallestshell-money,
hisredearth, andhisshell hatchet, andasked hismother for
hisbanana fruit.'They haveplucked themall,'sheanswered,
1
exceptthese little ones attheendofthebunch.''Pluck
them alloff/saidQat. Then hetook acocoa-nut-shell bottle
andstowed allhisthings andhisfoodwithinit,made him-
selfsmall andtook hisseatwithinit,andbade hismother
count three waves, andatthefourth small wave tothrow it
intothe sea. SoQat floated onandoninthebottle tillhe
cameuptothecanoe inwhich hisbrothers were, fortheyhad
notyetreached land. Then hefloated alongbefore thebow
ofthecanoe, andwhere hedriftedtheywere forced tofollow.
By-and-byhetook oneofhisbananas andateit,andthrew
theskin into theseawhere thecanoe would comealong.
Hisbrothers sawit,andremarked that itwas likethose

bananas ofQat's thattheyhadtaken;they enquired among
themselves whohadbeeneatingabanana, andwhen alldenied,
TangarotheWise spokeout :'You fellows,' saidhe,'itis
Qatwhohaseaten thisbanana, andhasthrown theskin of
ithere forus,togiveusnotice thatheisnotdead,butthathe
hasescapedand isfollowingus.'Buttherestofthem would
notlisten tohim, declaringthatQatwasdead. Thesame
happened againwhen hethrew outforthem another banana
skin. After thistheysawthebottle itself inwhich Qatwas
floating,closeuptothecanoe, andoneofthem took itup,
thinkingthat itwasagood cocoa-nut, butwhen hesmelt it
andfound thesmell bad,hethrew itaway again.Thisthey
didoneafter another, except TangarotheWise,whodidnot
happentoobserve it.Thendat floatedquicklytotheshore
ofMaewo, andemergedfrom hisbottle;hecolours hishair
with theredearth, binds hissmallshell-moneyround his
head, sticks hiscock's-tail plumeinhishair, takes hisseaton
thetopofamalepandanus-treeonthebeach, andthere he
sitsandwaits forhisbrothers tocome tolandwhowere still
inthecanoe. Presently theycame through thereefandup
totheshore, andthen theylooked upandsawhimsitting
inthepandanus, andenquired oneofanother who itwas
sitting1upthere.'ItisQat,'saidTangarotheWise;but
hisbrothersarguedthathecould nothavemade hisway
thither, seeingthathewasalreadydead.'That isQat,and
nomistake,' saidTangarotheWise;forheknew better than
hisbrothers about thisand allotherthings. Sotheybrought
their canoe toland, buthadnoneed tohaul itup,forQat
made therocks toriseandbear ithighanddry. Qatleaped
down uponthem with hisaxe,andhewed thecanoe topieces
forthem with thissong,'Chop, chopthecanoe;whose
canoe isit?Marawa's canoe. Mybrothers tricked meabout
twisting astringswell nutmeg-tree anddraw thesnare.
Ihadone canoe,mycanoe slippedofffrom me.' Sohe
chopped thecanoe topiecesbefore their face. After thishe
made friends with them, andbadethem live inharmony
together.


x.] Adventures ofQat. 163
Another remarkable series ofadventures were Qat's en-
counters with Qasavara. Thiswasavui,very strong-,agreat
fighter, tyrantandcannibal, whodwelt intheisland which
wasthehome ofQatandhisbrothers. Onedaythebrothers
went tobathe, andfoundfloating down thestream afruit of
theTahitian chestnut, amake. The others took itupone
after another andrejected it,thinkingitwasnotgood,but
Qattook itandfound itgood, andgaveittohismother to
cook. Each ofthebrothers ashereturned frombathingwent
totheirmother forfood. Shehadnothing butQat's make,
andtheyeachtook abitofit;TangarotheFool finished it.
Qatsentthem togetsome more, andfollowing upthestream
down which this fruithad floated theycame uponthetree.
Theyclimbed uponittogatherthechestnuts, andTangaro
theFooldropped oneupon thehouse ofQasavara, overwhich
thebrancheshung. Outcame theogreinarage,seized and
killed thebrothers, andputthem inhisfood-chest. Qat
waited fivedays, then took hisbowandarrows and shell
hatchet andwent insearch. Followingthestream hefound
the tree,anddivining what hadhappened, broughtout
Qasavara bydroppingamakeonhishouse. They fought,and
Qatkilled Qasavara;then, searchingforhisbrothers, hefound
their bones inthefood-chest. Herevived thembyblowing
throughareed into their mouths, andbidding them, ifthey
were hisbrothers, laugh. Another adventure notverycon-
sistent with this isthus narrated. Qasavarafallinginwith
Qatandhisbrothers invited them tohisvillage, andmade a
fireinhisoven forthem. When itwasevening hetoldthem
thattheywere tosleepbythemselves inhisgamal ;butthey,

Qatandhisbrothers tookuptheir abode atTatgan.Itwas,
however, fromGaua thatthestorymakes Qat tohavetaken
hisdeparture from theworld. Where nowinthecentre of
that island isthegreat lake, theTas, there wasformerlya
great plaincovered with forest. Qatcuthimself alargecanoe

often ridiculed byhisbrothers, andaskedhowhewould ever

would seeby-and-by. When thecanoe wasfinished hetook
inside ithiswifeandbrothers, collected thelivingcreatures
ofthe island, even those sosmall asants,andshuthimself
withthem inside thecanoe, towhich hehadmade acovering.
Thencame adelugeofrain;thegreathollow oftheisland

apparently standingintothechannel ofthewaterfall stream,
cried outthatQatwascomeagain,andthat hiscanoeknew

storyisolder thananyknowledgeofNoah's arkamongthe

Itisveryprobablethat Lata,who issaidbythepeopleof
Santa Cruz tohavemademenandanimals, isregarded by
them asQatwasregarded bythepeopleoftheBanks'
Islands;andTinota isaduka ofthesame kind with Lata.
Astorywhich istoldofNatei, nowthechiefman atNelua in
Santa Cruz, shews abelief alsoinsuchbeingsastheBanks'

thesimilarstoryofManlepeiinVanua Lava wasdoubtless
toldofsome other man,andbysome otherman ofhimself,
longbefore histime. Thepresent younger generationat

Thenearest oftheBanks' Islands totheNew Hebrides is
Merlav, Star Island, andthere Qatand hisbrothers arethe
subjectsofthestories common intherestofthegroup. The
northernmost oftheNew Hebrides andnearest toMerlav is
Maewo, Aurora, andthere Qat,thoughnotunknown, isnot

wui.Ofanywu'ithebelief inMaewo wasthathehadno

the stories ofTagaro, whowasawui,dealwithhim asthe
stories oftheBanks' Islands dealwith Qat. Ofthebrothers

Suqe-matua would have allthingsbad.WhenTagaro made

Tagaro caughtisgoodforfood,what hemissed isworthless.
Tagarolived atMambarambara, andparticularlyatHombio,
not farfrom Tanoriki. Hewasnotborn there, butthere he
lived, made hiscanoe, built hishouse and hisgamal^ and
created andraised hisfood. His lifewas fullofwonders;his

angry because some onestole hispig,andwent offtoMamalu,
