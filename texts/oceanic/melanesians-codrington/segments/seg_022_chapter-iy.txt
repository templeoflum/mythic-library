CHAPTER IY.
PROPEETY ANDINHERITANCE.
INthecharacter ofproperty andinthelaws ofsuccession
toproperty,there ishardly anydifference tobefound inthe
Melanesian islands with which weareconcerned;inallit
maybesaidthatpropertyisinlandand inpersonal posses-
sions;that there isacertain distinction between landwhich
hasbeen inherited andthatwhich hasbeen reclaimed from
thewaste;that there isnostrictly communalpropertyin
land;andthatwith landed andpersonal property alike, the
original rightofsuccession iswith the sister's children,
except where, besides thevery exceptionalcase ofSaa, there
comes inthesuccession ofchildren totheproperty which
their father hasacquiredforhimself.
Thelandmaybeconsidered everywheretobedivided into
threeparts:(i)theTown lots;(2)theGarden ground ;_(g)
theBush. InFlorida, (i)NaKomu, (2)NaMatanga, (3)Na
Leiao;inSanta Cruz, (i)Natalia, (2)Nabalo, (3)Nabanogabo ;
inMota, (i) Vanua, (2) Utag, (3) Mot; inLepers'
Island, (i)AVanue, (2)ALabute, (3)ALabutevirogi, which
inAragaare(i)Vanua, (2)Lolgae, (3)Utevono;andthese

these three divisions oftheland, thebush, theuncleared

natives fixanylimit uptowhich theyconsider thebush

which they live,although probably theywould resent the
fellingoftrees toonear theirowngrounds. Thegardens
andthe sites ofthevillagesare allheld inproperty,and
passbyinheritance;sothatevery parthas itsowner for
thetime,whopossessesitashisshare ofthefamily property,
butwhocanbynomeans alienate itasifitwere simply
hisown. The chiefs, however powerfulinsomeplaces they
may be,have nomorepropertyintheland ormoreright
over itinanyoftheislands than othermen;theyoften
usetheir power tyrannicallytodrive awaytheowners of
gardens whichthey covet, andtheyarevery willingtomeet
thecommon Europeanbelief that achief istheowner of
thesoil,bytakingapriceforlandwhich isnottheirs tosell;
buttheownershipofevery pieceisremembered andwillbe
asserted when occasion offers. Theremarkable case ofthe
landless chiefs atSaa(page 50)shews how fixed istheright
ofpropertyinland. Before thecomingofEuropeansthe
saleofland was, atleast atSaa,notunknown, butwas at
anyrateuncommon;oflate, especiallyintheNew Hebrides,
much land hasbeen sold toEuropeans, somehonestlyand
effectively, somebytransactions inwhich thetitleofthevendor
hasbeennothing buthiswillingnesstoreceive some calico
andguns. Inatrue saletheconsent ofallwhohavean
interest intheproperty must behad,andtheexactboundary
ofeachparcel ofland defined;then thevalue ofeachpiece
andofeach fruit-tree hastobeascertained, andtheclaim of
orforest. TheveiJcau iscommon toallmembers ofacommunity,buttheyavu
andtheqelearedivided andsubdivided. Each owner, however, holds forthe
household towhich hebelongs, thehousehold holds fortheclan, theclan for
thetribe, thetribe forthecommunity, andthecommunityforposterity. Each
generation hastheusufructonly,andcannot alienate theland. Thechiefs
have overridden this rule, butmostunjustly.' This will stand forthe
islands west ofFiji,with theimportant difference made bytheabsence of
tribes.

every singleindividual discussed and satisfied. Afruit-tree
plantedonanother's land, with hisconsent, remains thepro-
pertyoftheplanter andofhisheirs1
.Itisimportant alsoto
observe that theproperty, whether inthevillagesorinthe
gardens,doesnot lieinlargedivisionscorrespondingtothe
divisions ofthepeopleformarriage purposesintotwoormore
kins orclans, thefcema ofFlorida, theveveofMota, thewai
vungofLepers'Island;but allareintermixed. Itisprobable
enoughthat intheoriginal formation ofeach settlement the
several divisions ofthepeople workedtogethertomake
their gardens;asitis,families have formed themselves
within thedivisions, theland isheldbyfamilies, sonswork
intheir fathers'gardens who arenottheir kin;there cannot
beafamily,ormarriedcouple,inwhich twokindreds atleast
have notashare.
Itisremarkable indeed howpreciselyalike intheSolomon
Islands, theBanks' Islands, and theNew Hebrides, the
character ofpropertyinlandreclaimed from thebush asserts
itself tobe;andhowthesame effect hasbeenproducedof
introducingorstrengthening thetendency towards the
succession ofthesontohisfather'sproperty,inplaceofthe
rightofsuccession throughthemother. This willbeshewn,
togetherwith thevery general agreementinthewhole
character oflandedpropertyand succession toit,asthe
subjectistreated insome detail with examples taken from
theseveralgroups, beginningwith Florida intheSolomon
Islands, andpassingeastwardsthroughSanta Cruzandthe
Banks' Islands totheNew Hebrides.
InFlorida thehouse sites intheJcomu, likethegardensof
thematanga^ arehereditary property; and,thoughthere do
1InFiji,'Fruit-trees areoften heldbypersons whodonotowntheland;
butthere isacurious distinction here. Thepropertyinthiscase israther in
thefruitthan inthetree,and istherefore notconsidered tobeintheland.
Youmaytake thefruit, butyoumust notcutdown thetreewithout the
landowner'spermission. Aremarkable distinction wasmade byoneofmy
Fijianinformants. Hewhohasatreeonanother man's landmaycut itdown
andtake itaway;hisaxedoesnottouch thesoil;buthemaynotdigthetree
upbytheroots, forhisdigging-stickwould turnupthe soil.' Eev. L.Fison.

taken asrepresentingthose ofthesurroundingislands ofthe

man's children succeed himwith theconsent oftheheirs at

Woser gaveapigtohisuncle, andhethereupon relinquished
hisclaim tohalfthepropertyinthegarden ground,which he
didnot use.The heir ofthedeceased, andtheheir alsoin

forbyasumofmoney, tulag,afterreceiving which nofurther

IntheNew Hebrides theancient succession ofthe sister's
sontohisuncle'sproperty appearstobestrongly maintained
inAraga,Pentecost Island, where thenephewsucceeds tothe
house, thegarden, andthepigsofhisuncle, andthesontakes
nothing except what hisfather hasgiven himinhislifetime;
andeven ifamanmakes agardenforhimself outofthebush
itmustgotohissister sson. Itisvery different, however, in
Lepers' Island, where therightofthesister's sonseems tobe
barely recognized, andthepropertyinthevillages andinthe
gardensisheldbyindividuals astheir own, notasbelonging
tothewaivung. Thetown lotsarefenced round, sothat the
houses stand inenclosures. Aman's sonsucceeds tohishouse
property,butwillnotliveinthehouse solongashismother
and sisters arethere, onaccount ofthose restrictions upon
intercourse which have beenalreadymentioned. Houses are
renewed inthesameplace, butnotalways onthesame site,
andvillagesareoften shifted, thepropertyintheground
beingborne inmind.Aman'sgarden-ground, labute, goesto
hissons,whoarrange thedivision ofitamong themselves,
unless their father hasexpressedhiswill'about itbefore his
death. Women donotsucceed toland,buthave arighttoa

andthere cannot beanydifference between thisandhishere-
ditary property.Gardens areallfenced. Fruit-treesplantedon
another man's landremain thepropertyoftheplanter andhis
heirs. Itisinthesuccession toaman'spersonal property
that therightsofkinshipassert themselves. Onaman's
death hissons distribute hispigs,money, andotherpossessions,
amongthose ofhiswaivung, achoice pigandalargershare of
other things being giventothesister's son,because hisspecial
relationshipismuchregarded. Aman, however, willmake
hiswill, expressinghiswishes astothedispositionofhis
propertybefore hisdeath. The succession topropertyisa
fruitful source ofquarrels, and itisnatural thatopportunity
shouldprevailoveracknowledged rightwhen theheirs areout
oftheway.
Thereappears uponthewhole aremarkable tendency
throughoutthese islands ofMelanesia towards thesubstitution
ofaman'sown children forhissister's children, andothers of
hiskin, insuccession tohisproperty;and thisappearsto
begin where thepropertyistheproduceoftheman's own
industry,with theassistance inmost cases ofhissons, asin
gardens newlycleared from theforest, inhismoney,hispigs,
andhiscanoes. Theoriginal rightofaman's own kin,and
especiallyhis sister's sons, tobehisheirs notonlytothe
hereditarylands which havecomedown inthekinbutto
personal property,isyetstrongly maintained, even atLepers'
Island, where thea'dvance towards thepatriarchal system has
been soconsiderable. Itisprobablethateven atSaasome-
thingstillsurvives ofwhatmusthavebeentheoriginal custom
oftheancestors ofthatpeople,aswell asoftherestofthe
Melanesians. Itisevident thatthenewer form ofsuccession
depends upon theassertion ofpaternity ;andasitarises some-
times ontheoccupation ofnewground,itmaybethoughtto
bestrengthened bytheformation ofnewsettlements after the
familyhasestablished itself within thekin.
