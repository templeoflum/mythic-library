SACRED PLACES AND THINGS.
ITisalmost certain that idols findnoplaceintheaccount
which Inowproceedtogiveofsacredplaces andobjectsas
Iamacquainted withthem inMelanesia. Itistruethatthe
word is5commonly enoughused todescribe anykind ofimage
ofnative workmanship, whether there bereally somethingof
asacred character attached toit,ornone whatever. The
peopleofSan Cristoval, Ugi,andUlawa wereconspicuous
fortheir fondness forcarving andthe skillwithwhich they
worked;amanamong themwould amuse himself byshaping
asoftstone orbitofwood intoafigureofaman orbird, or
fish, aswell asincarving bywayofdecoration whathemade
foruse. Ihave seen atFagani (Ha'ani)inSanCristoval
aremarkablyclever group over theapexofagable, which
representedamanclimbing uptoshoot anopossum, andthe
animallooking down uponhimfrom thetopofthepolein
themost natural attitude. Thiswouldhardlybetaken for
anidol,but isasmuch anidol asmany figures which have
found theirwayintomuseums assuch. The canoe-houses,
common halls, public-houses,called inthoseparts oka,were
fullofcarvingsintheconstructive aswell asdecorativeparts.
Some ofthese, thepostsforexamplewhichsupporttheridge-
poleandpurlins, areoftenfiguresofmen,whowould be
looselycalled ancestors bytheprincipal peopleofthevillage,
andthese would betreated withrespect;sometimes foodand
betel-nuts would beseen laidbefore them. Butthese hadno
sacred character, further than thatthey were memorials of

deceased great men,whoseghosts visitingtheir accustomed
abodes would bepleased'atmarks ofmemoryand affection,
and irritated bydisrespect.There wasnonotion ofthe
ghostofthedead taking uphisabode intheimage,norwas
theimage supposedtohaveanysupernatural efficacyinitself.
InanyohainMalanta maybeseenanimageofashark, a
sword-fish, orabonito, before whichportionsoffood are
placed;andthesefigureswillbesaid tobefathers, grand-
fathers, ancestors ofthosewho thusrespect them. These
areindeedreceptaclesofthedead, notoftheirspirits,butof
their mortal remains orrelics;such cannot becalled idols.
Althoughtoothey sometimes make other images andgive
thenames ofthedead tothem bywayofremembrance, they
donotprayorsacrifice atsuchimages, noraretheythought
holy.InFlorida arudely-shaped imageofamanmight
often havebeen seen inasacredplacenear avillageorbythe
sea-shore, with cocoa-nuts tied toitorfood laid atitsfeet;
thiswould beatindalo, animage representing some powerful
mandeceased;thefoodwould beforhimtoeat;theimagewas
sacred. That istosay,theimage wasamemorial ofsome
tindalo, andwasnotthoughttohavepowerinitself, ortobe
inhabited bytheghostofthedeparted. Images representing
atindalo were alsocutonthepostsofthecanoe-houses, mere
memorials notmuchregarded,andapproached withoutrespect.
The stocks setupinSanta Cruz torepresentthedead are
thesimplestofmemorials. IntheBanks' Islands tree-fern
trunks cutintoveryrudefiguresofmenwere often seen
memorials made atfuneralfeasts, having really nosacred
character atall.Inthesame islands theimagescarried
about attheSuqe feasts, andafterwards setupintheeating-
places propertotherankthey represent, maywellbetaken

and soindeed maythefigure, thenule, intowhich thepost

figureoftheparticular deceased, butinconventional form;
sometimes carved outoftree-fern trunks, sometimes fashioned
withwickerwork andsago spathes, andpainted andadorned.
Some shutupfromcommon viewbybamboo screens may
probably belongtosecret societies. Inthesame island drams
are setupforfuneral feasts with fantastic faces cutupon
them, andthese remain asinamannerimagesofthedeceased,
taken byvisitors foridols ordevil-drums. Intheneighbour-
ingislands similar imagesaremade.
Sacredplaces have almost alwaysstones inthem;itis
impossible totreatseparatelysacredplaces andsacred stones.
Butwhereas someplacesaresacred because stones arethere,
thestones seen inotherplaces havebeentaken there aspart
ofthefurniture ofasacredplace. Someplacesalsoand
stones maybesaid tohave theoriginoftheir sacredness in
gravesorrelics ofthedead,and sohavehadtheir character
given them bymen;while others aresacred because the
stones arethere, thestones beingsacred becauseassociated
with aspirit.Itiswellhere torecall thedistinction which
seems soimportant betweenghosts,thedisembodiedspirits
ofmen deceased, andspirits,ofanother order from thesouls
ofmen, which have never been connected with ahuman
body; andtoremember that, speaking generally,thereligion
oftheSolomon Islands isconcerned withghosts,thatofthe
Banks' Islands andNew Hebrides withspirits.
The sacredplaces andobjectsoftheSolomon Islands
shall befirstdescribed;and firstofallthose which belongto
sepulture. InFlorida asacredplaceiscalled vunuka.

without duecause;"butthoseplaces where theremains of
peopleofrank aredeposited,where sacrifices areoffered, and
which maybecalledfamily sanctuaries, areregarded with
very great respect. Some ofthese arevery ancient, thelio'a,
orpowerful ghost, who isworshipped there, beingaremote
ancestor. Itsometimes happensthat themanwho has
offered the sacrifice insuch aplacedieswithout having fully
instructed hissonintheproper chant ofinvocation with
which theHoaoughttobeapproached. Theyoung manwho
succeeds him isthen afraid togothere often, andbeginsa
newplace, taking some ashes from theoldsacrificialfire-place

Malanta tobuild shrines forrelics, but itissometimes done
when theoJia^canoe-house,isfull. Such shrines arecommon
inSan Cristoval inthevillages,and inthesacredplaces
wheregreatmenhave been buried. Totrespass onthese
sacredplaces would bealways likelytorouse theangerofthe
ghosts, some ofwhom besides areknown tobeofamalignant
disposition. Such aone isTapia, whose haunt isatthe
mouth ofariver near Ha'ani, and sacrifice towhom has
beenalreadydescribed.
There aresacredplaces, however, intheSolomon Islands
which arenotplacesofsepulture, though none probablythe
sacredness ofwhich doesnotdependonthepresenceofa
ghost. InFlorida theappearanceofsomethingwonderful
willcause anyplacetobecome avunuha, thewonder being
anevidence oftheghostly presence. Forexample,aman

IntheNew Hebrides snakes areperhaps moreregarded than
intheBanks' Islands. Anative ofPentecost Island, ifhe

himself thejuiceofayoung cocoa-nut, andeverafterwards
expecttofind theworld gowellwithhimthrough the

house, moreparticularlyifitbeagreatman's house, theyare
persuadedthat itisaspirit ;itisgogona, nottobelightly ap-
proached;itbrings goodluck tothehouse, andmakes the
owner riseintheJiuqe society. Thehouse itself istreated
withrespect ;noone \tfillthrow astone atit,ormount upon
it;thesnake would resent suchdisrespect andmake the
offender ill.
There isanamphibioussea-snake marked with bands of
darkandlight colour, which intheBanks' Islands andNew
Hebrides isalways more orlessdreaded whenever itisseen.
Inthese islands itisgenerallycalled mae,and itisthiskind
