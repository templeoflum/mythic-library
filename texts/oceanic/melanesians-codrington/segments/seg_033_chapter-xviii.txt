MISCELLANEOUS.
(i)Cannibalism. Itmaybesafelyasserted that inthe
Banks' Islands andSanta Cruz there hasbeennocannibalism,
thoughthenatives werenotignorantofthepracticeofitby
others. When somefifty years agoapartyofmenfrom
Tonga,asitisremembered, leftthe little island ofQakea, on
which theyhad forashort time settled, theproofsthatthey
hadeaten thosewhomtheyhadkilled inthefightingwhich
precededtheir departurecaused such horror andrage against
them that aparty returningayearafter tothesameplace
wasimmediatelyattacked. IntheSolomon Islands itis
strangethat thepracticehasrecentlyextended itself. Itis
asserted bytheelder natives ofFlorida thatman's fleshwas
never eaten exceptinsacrifice, andthatthesacrificingofmen
isanintroduction oflatetimes from further west. Thecoast
peopleofBugotu saythesame ofthemselves;butthey freely
accuse theinlandpeopleofthesame island, withwhom they
have agooddeal offreeintercourse, andwhose speechisnot
verydifferent from theirown, ofbeing cannibals, andofkilling
men forthesakeofeating them.Afewyears agooneNunu,
aninland chief, wasbelieved tosaythatpig'sfleshwasbad
andman's fleshsweet tohim;amanwhohadmounted tohis
placeandfound himself inasweat would sitdown tocool
before heshowed himself;Nunu took thesweat asasignof
fatness, andwould desire toeathim. InUlawa, again,there


344Miscellaneous.[CH.
isnoeatingofmen;itisthoughtthatthelio'a,theghostsof
power,donotlike it;andatSaa itwasnottheoldcustom of
theplace,theeldermenevennow willhavenothingtodo
with it.Theyounger menhave taken toit,and eatthe
bodies ofmen killed inbattle;they have followed the
custom ofmenfrom theeastern coastwhohave lived with
them, andoftheBauro men ofSan Cristoval whom they
have visited. Thenatives ofSanCristoval notonlyeatthe
bodies ofthosewho areslain inbattle, but sellthe flesh.
Tokill forthepurposeofeating humanflesh, though not
unknown, israre,and isathing which marks themanwho
hasdone it.This isasubject onwhich stories which come
from traders arenotvery trustworthy. IntheNorthern
New Hebrides there isnodoubt cannibalism. Iknow
nothingabout itinAurora, buthave been toldbyan
eye-witnessofwhat isdone inPentecost. After abitter
fight theywould takeaslainenemy andeathim, asasignof
rageandindignation;theywould cookhim inanoven, and
eachwould eatabitofhim,women andchildren too.When
therewasalessbitterfeeling, theflesh ofadeadenemy was
taken awaybytheconquerorstobecooked andgiventotheir
friends. Intheneighbouring islands, and attheback of
hisown island, saidmyinformant, theykill forthesake of
eating.InLepers'Islandtheystill eatmen. Itwasnotthe
common fashion, however, toeatenemies killed infairfight-
ing,itwasamurderer orparticularlydetested enemy whowas
eaten, inanger,and totreathim ill;such aonewascooked
likeapig,andmen, elderwomen andboysatehim. The
boyswere afraid, butweremade todo it.Itisthefeeling
there that toeathuman flesh isadreadfulthing,aman-
eater isoneafraid ofnothing ;onthisground men willbuy
fleshwhen some onehasbeenkilled, thattheymaygetthe
name ofvaliant menbyeatingit.Acertain man inLepers'
Island mourned many daysforhisson,andwould noteat till
heboughtapieceofhuman flesh forhimself and hisre-
maining boy ;itwasahorridthingtodo,appropriatetohis
gloomy grief.


xviii.] Heads.Castaways. 345
(2)Heads.Head-huntingisnotpractised byanyofthe
natives eastwards from Ysabel; that istosay,theydonot
makeexpeditionsforthesolepurposeofobtainingheads. In
Bugotu, thesouth-easternextremityofYsabel, thepeople have
suffered and still suffer mostseriously from theattacks ofthe
head-hunters frombeyond, whoseexpeditions, followingthe
coasts from agreat distance, andsometimes formonths, have
reached Malanta andGuadalcanar, inonemostdisgraceful
instance thehead-hunters being broughttoFlorida inan
Europeanvessel. Thepractice, however, oftakingheads and
preserving them assignsofpower andsuccessbelongstothe
Solomon Islandsgenerally. Theheads ofenemies killed in
fightarepreservedastrophies, and setoutonstagesasin
Florida, orhungupunder theeaves ofthecanoe-house asin
SanCristoval. When achief intheexercise ofhisauthority
hadaman killed foranoffence, orhadhimmurdered outof
revengeorhatred, orforasacrifice, headded thehead tohis
collection;itwasasignofhispowerandgreatness. Hence,
asthemore heads hecould show themore hispower wasin
view, hewasready onevery opportunityandonanypretext
totakealifeandahead. When achiefhadaman killed, he
would keep thehead, butsentthelegsandarms tohisneigh-
bours, toshewwhat hehaddone. If,forexample, anaccused
mangotawayfromMboli inFlorida toSavo, theMboli chief
would send arequest, backedbyapresentofmoney,tothe
Savo chief tohavehim killed;theSavo chief would keep
theheadandsend alegorarm toFlorida, where thechief
wouldhangituptoshew hispower. Theheads thustaken
andpreservedaredistinct from those ofdeceased relatives,
which arekeptasmemorials ofaffection. Skulls may be
seensuspended equallyattheentrance ofaSolomon Island
okaandaNew Hebrides gamal, butthesignification is,in
allcasesprobably,distinct.
(3)Castaways. Astrangerassuchwasgenerally through-
outtheislands anenemytobekilled. Thus atFlorida a
stranger whohadescaped from awreck ontoanisletwas
killedwhen seen,andspokenofasacocoa-nut thathadfloated


346 Miscellaneous.[CH.
ashore. There wasacommon belief that astranger would
bring withhim disease orsome other mischief. But itwas
often aquestion whether acastaway wasastranger.Ifhe
wererecognisedasbelongingtoanhostiledistrict, therewas
nodoubt ofhisfate;but ifhefellintothehands ofthose
towhose division, kerna orveve,hebelonged, hewouldprob-
ablybesaved. Itisanotuncommonthing that canoes
should beblown from Santa Cruz andtheReef Islands to
Malanta andUlawa;themen onboard them were not
wholly strangers, though personally unknown;theyweremen
andfromknown lands, notstrange beingslikewhitemen
from without theworld.Theywere therefore received as
guests, sometimesestablishing themselves after awhile by
marriage, sometimeswaiting anopportunitytoreturn.
Many single canoes from time totimehavebeenblown away
fromPolynesian islands, andhave drifted totheBanks'
Islands;inmanycases thecastaways havebeenkindly treated,
andhave added astrain tothenative race. Within the
lastforty yearsmenfromTikopiahave twice been most
kindly received atMota.
(4)Slaves. There isnosuchthingasslavery properlyso
called. Inhead-hunting expeditions prisonersaremade for
thesake oftheir heads, tobeusedwhen occasionrequires, and
suchpersonslivewith theircaptorsinaconditionvery
different from that offreedom, buttheyarenottaken or
maintained forthepurposesofservice. Inthesame islands
when asuccessful attack andmassacre enriches thevictors
withmany heads, they spareandcarryoffchildren, whomthey
bring upamongtheirownpeople. Such asekawillcertainly
bekilled forahead orforasacrifice before anynative member
ofthecommunity,buthelives asanadopted member, shares
thework, pleasures, anddangersofthose withwhom he
dwells, andoften becomes aleading personage among them.
Arefugeeoracastawayisnotaslave butaguest;his life
isnaturally much lessvalued than that ofaman oftheplace,
and useful services areexpectedfrom him, while hemixes
freely andonequal terms with thecommonpeople.


xviii.] Burying andBurningAlive. 347
(5)Buryingalive.Nothing- seems moreinhuman than the
practiceofburyingsickandaged people alive, yetitis
certain thatwhen thiswasdone therewasgenerallyakind-
nessintended. Itistruethatsometimes therelatives ofthe
sickbecame tired ofwaiting upon them, andburied them
whentheythought theyoughttobereadyforit;buteven
insuch cases thesickandaged acquiesced.Itwascommon
forthem tobegtheir friends toputthem outoftheirmisery.
Someyears agoaman atMota buried hisbrother, whowas
inextreme weakness from influenza;butheheapedtheearth
looselyover hishead, andwent from time totime toask
himwhether hewere still alive. Oflateyears, thoughold
peopleaskforit,their friends willnotconsent. Notlong
agoinPentecost, awoman after alingeringsickness inatime
offamine was buried, andwasheard forthreedays crying
inhergrave. InLepers'Island thepatient wassometimes
strangled, with hisownconsent1
.
(6)Burningalive. This hasonlybeen heard ofatAraga,
Pentecost Island. Infightingtime there, ifagreatman
wereveryangry with thehostileparty, hewould burn a
wounded enemy. Whenpeacehadbeenmade, andthechiefs
hadordered alltobehave wellthat thecountry mightsettle
down inquiet,ifanyonecommitted such acrime aswould
break upthepeace, such asadultery, theywould tiehim toa
tree,heapfirewood round him,andburnhimalive, aproof
totheopposite partyoftheir detestation ofhiswickedness.
Thiswasnotdonecoollyasamatter ofcourse intheexecu-
tion ofalaw,butasahorrible thingtodo,anddone forthe
horror ofit;ahorror renewed inthevoice and face ofthe
native who toldmeoftheroaring*flames and shrieks of
agony.
1Inthesame island, inthebushcountry,therewasagreatmanwhohad
apoor brother. Inatime offamine thepoorman stole food, notaskingfood
from hisbrother, ortakingitfrom him. Thechief buried hisbrother alive,
inspiteofhisown wife'sentreaties, andthepoorman'ssupplications ;he
bound him,dugagrave, putmats init,threw himinandburied him. The
actwasshockingtotheopinion oftheislanders, but itmarked agreatman
whowould dowhat hechose.

(7)HeavenlyBodies. There isnoappearanceofabelief
thatanyheavenlybodies areliving* beings ;intheBanks'
Islands theSunandMoon arethoughttoberocks orislands.
InLepers'Island thestoryistold that theSunandthe
Moonquarrelledwhile theSunwasmakingamash ofwild
yam,andthathethrew themess inarageattheMoon's face,
onwhich thesplashesaretobeseen; butthis istoldwithout
anyserious belief. Itiscommonlybelieved that there isa
humanbeing, male orfemale, intheMoon. The stories of
Vulaninggela andKamakajaku shew thebelief inFlorida and
Ysabel that there isaperson whogoes with theSunand
whose name isSun,rather than thattheSun isaperson. In
Florida thename oftheMan intheMoon isNgava ;when
theMoon rises fullthey cry'There isNgava sitting.' Every
newmoon isthoughttobereally new.Nocause issupposed

thesame sortofportent ;somegreatman will die,there will
beanattack ofenemies. Theappearanceoftwo stars
closetogether,warue inLepers' Island, signifieswar. The
Solomon Islandspeoplearemore concerned about thestars
than their Eastern brethren, perhapsbecause oftheirlonger
voyages ;theSanta Cruzpeople andReef islanders excel all
therestintheirpractical astronomy. TheBanks' islanders
andNorthern New Hebridespeople content themselves with
distinguishingthePleiades, bywhich theapproachofyam
harvest ismarked, andwithcallingtheplanets masoi, from their
roundness, asdistinct fromvitu, stars. InFlorida theearly
morningstar iscalled gamanivotu, thequartz pebblefor

(8)Months and Seasons. Themoon isnaturally the
measure oftime; there isnonative notion ofayearasa
periodoffixed time;theword, tauorniulu, which corresponds
mostnearlytothewordyear, signifiesaseason, and sonow
thespaceoftimebetweenrecurringseasons;thus theyam

isanywhere purelynative. Itisimpossibletofitthenative

(9)Narcotics. The useoftheareca nutmbua, chewed
withthebetelleaf,with theaddition ofcoral lime,isuniversal
intheSolomon Islands andSanta Cruz, andextends to
Tikopia;totheeastward itisunknown. Solomon islanders

natives ofthatgroup sometimes chew toquiet hunger,but
which willnotdoforthosewhoknow thembua, andtheycan

where thatpepper grows naturally,buttheyfeelthatthey

duction thattheuseofithadnotspreadtoSanta Maria a

seems topointtotwodistinct sources ortimes ofintroduction.

aroughcoralpestle andmortar. Themoderate useofthis
narcotic hasnobadeffect;excess, which ismorecommonper-
hapsintheNew Hebrides, makes aman listless andstupid.
Theplantused isnotindigenous ;there isindeed apepperof
thesamespecies verycommon, but itwillnotdoforthe
woana. There isacertain sacred character about theplant,
ashasbeenshewn, andtheuseofitisconfined tomen. The
introduction oftobacco intocommon useintheNorthern New
Hebrides andBanks' Islands isquite recent, butthepeople
arenowgiven uptotheuseofit.Smoking wasuniversal in
theSolomon Islands, atFlorida, Ysabel, andSan Cristoval,
thirty years ago,withmen,women, andinfant children, and
thetobacco wasgrown andprepared bythenatives;yetit
wasnotknown atSaaatthat time,where ithassince been
introduced from Arosi inSanCristoval, andtheeldermen at
Florida remember when itwasanewthingintheir childhood.
There hasbeen formany yearsagooddeal ofintercourse
with whalers atSanCristoval;theyhavenonative name for
tobacco there, andIbelieve never grewit;itsintroduction
then isreadilyaccounted for.InFlorida thenative-grown

(10) Counting. Measures. Thesystemsofnumeration in

explained,butIhave treated thesubjectelsewhere. Itwillbe
however reasonable tosaysomethingastomethods ofcounting.
Thefingersarethenatural counters;intheuseofthem there

(12)Wild Men. InFlorida theybelieve that onthe

IntheNew Hebrides, similar creatures areseenbaskingon

these aremen. However much these storiesvary,thebelief
maybesaidtobegeneralfrom Ysabel toMae, justasstories
ofwildmenhavebeen current inNew Zealand.Descriptions
