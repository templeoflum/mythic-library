CHAPTER VI.
SOCIETIES. CLUBS.
INevery village andgroupofhouses intheTorres Islands,
theBanks' Islands, andtheNorthern New Hebrides, iscon-
spicuousabuilding- which doesnotappeartobeadwelling-
house. Inapopulous villageoftheBanks' Islands itisvery
longand low,with entrances atintervalsalong the sides
below thewall-plate, with stone seats orastoneplatformat
themain entrances ateither end,andlowstone wallsplanted
with dracaenas andcrotons near thesame, with thejawbones
ofpigsandbackbones offishhanging under theeaves;and
veryoften theclatter ofpoundingsticks inwooden vessels and
white clouds ofsteam makeknown thepreparationofameal.
This isagamal. Thesamename, andabuildingofthesame
general character, withsome difference ofform, istobefound
intheNew Hebrides asfarsouth astheShepherdIslands at
least. What arecalled'Chiefs' houses'inNew Caledonia
probably represent thesame. Insome oftheBanks' Islands,
again,avisitor onenteringavillage would seeoneormore
platforms squarelybuilt upofstones, withhigh, pointed
little edifices upon them, openinthefront likeshrines, the
embers ofafirebelow, andabove animage grotesquely shaped

Here againthere isaman, perhapstwoorthree, latelyraised
toanewdegree,forwhom aspecial eating-place hasbeen
prepared;orthemen ofhigh degreehave alldiedoutfrom
thevillage,andnooneoflower rank canenter into their
place. Within, these long buildingsarefound tobedivided
across bylogfences, theiingtingiav, thefire-boundaries;each
division contains itsoven, with theappliancesforcookery
around;logpillows andmatscompletethefurniture. The
gamaVisaclub-house, and the club iscalled theSiiqe
intheislands where Ihaveanyconsiderableacquaintance
with it.
InalltheMelanesian groupsitistherulethat there isin
every villageabuildingofpublic character, where themen
eatandspendtheir time, theyoung mensleep, strangersare
entertained;where asintheSolomon Islands thecanoes are
kept ;where imagesareseen, andfromwhich women are
generallyexcluded;thekiala ofFlorida, theokaofSan
Cristoval, themadai ofSanta Cruz, thetambu house oftraders,
thehire ofFiji ;and allthese nodoubtcorrespondtothe
lalai and otherpublichalls oftheMalay Archipelago.
Butthese arenotclub-houses, asarethegamalhouses ofthe
Suqe,which serve indeed toaconsiderable extent forpublic
purposes,because almosteveryman isamember oftheclub,

ThenameSuqeisthesame asthatoftheWm,thesuper-
naturalpersonage, SupweoftheNew Hebrides, but itis
doubtful whetheranyconnexion between thetworeally
exists;forintheBanks' Islands, where thesocietyisin
great vigour,there isnoVuiSuqeknown, andinWhitsun-
tideoftheNew Hebrides, where theWui,Supweisrecognized,
thesocietyhasanother name.Nothingisknown ofthe

Though women arecompletelyexcluded from theSuqeof

Afeast ofthesame kind isheld tocommemorate adeliver-

InthenorthernpartofMaewo, Aurora, intheNew

Thus, inthecaseofaboywhose richfatherbought himupat
