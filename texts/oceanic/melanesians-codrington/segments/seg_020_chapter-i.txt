CHAPTER I.
INTEODUCTORY.
THERE arefourgroupsofislands, within thatregionofthe
Western Pacific towhich thename ofMelanesia hasbeen
given,thatform acurved beltfollowing roughlytheoutline
oftheAustralian coast, atageneraldistance ofsome fifteen
hundred miles, andturning awayfrom theimportant outlying
ArchipelagoofFiji;these aretheSolomon Islands, the
Santa Cruzgroup,theBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides,
andNew Caledonia with theLoyaltyIslands. There is
anundoubted connexion ofrace, languageand customs
amongthepeople who inhabit these groups;aconnexion
which further extends itselfthroughoutwhat iscalled
Melanesia toNewGuinea westwards, andeastwards toFiji.
Thedistinction between theMelanesianpeopleofthese groups
andthePolynesianseastwards ofFijiisclearly marked and
recognised,forthe linewhichseparatesMelanesian from
PolynesianfallsbetweenFijiandTonga. Nosuch linecan
bedrawn tomark such aboundarytothewest tillthe
Asiatic continent itself isreached. From thePolynesian?
islands oftheEast Pacific ontheone side,andfrom the
Asiatic islands oftheMalay Archipelagoonthe other,
twocurrents ofinfluence have poured andarepouringinto
Melanesia, theformer much more modern and direct, the
^latter ancient andbroken initscourse. Uponthese currents
floatrespectively thekava rootandthebetel-nut.. Theuse
ofthebetel iscommon toIndia, China, andtheMelanesian

theboundaryofthebetel-nut bythePolynesiansettlers
intheReef Islands ofSanta Cruz. Thepresent work is
notconcerned atallwith one ofthefourgroupsabove
mentioned, that ofNew Caledonia andtheLoyalty Islands,
norwith thelargersouthern members oftheNew Hebrides
group;itsview isconfined, exceptforoccasional illustration,
totheSolomon Islands, Ysabel, Florida, Savo, Guadalcanal*,
Malanta, SanCristoval, Ulawa, totheSanta Cruzgroup,the
Banks' andTorres Islands, andthree ofthenorthern New
Hebrides, Aurora, Pentecost andLepers'Islands. Within this
field arecontained certain islands inhabited byPolynesian
colonists from theEastwho still retain their Polynesian
speech. Such areNupani, Pileni, Nukapu, andother reef
islands oftheSwallowgroup, where thephysicalcharacter-
istics ofthePolynesian people may possiblybetraced, but
certainlyarenotconspicuous, having been lostbymixture
withneighbouringMelanesians. InRennell Island andBellona
Island, southern members oftheSolomongroup,thepeople
arephysically Polynesian;aladfrom Bellona, whowas in
New Zealand with Bishop Patteson, was inname(TeKiu),
colour, tattoo, andspeech verymuch aMaori. Menfrom the
Polynesiansettlements onMaeandFate intheNew Hebrides
havefound thelanguageofOntongJava liketheirown.
Thediscoveryofthese islands wasprolonged through
three centuries, and carried onbySpanish, French and
English voyagers.TheSpaniards found theSolomon Islands,
Santa Cruz, theBanks' Islands, and thenorthern New
Hebrides;theFrench added much later tothediscoveries in
these groups;theEnglish found, underCaptain Cook, the
principalislands oftheNew Hebrides andNewCaledonia,
andhave filled inthecharts. TheDutch discoveredFiji.
The earliest, andcertainly mostinteresting,discoveries were
those oftheSpaniards ;ofMendana inhistwovoyages
of1567 and1595, and ofQuiros andTorres in1606l
.
1Dr.Guppy,inhisSolomon Islands andtheir Natives, hasdiscussed these
discoveries atlength withspecial reference totheJournal ofGallego. Bythe
kindness ofMr.Woodford Ihave read thenarrative ofCotoira. Inboth the

Mendana, despatched bytheViceroyofPeru, reached in
1567the firstMelanesian land seenbyEuropeans,thegreat
island which henamed Santa Ysabel delaEstrella, andfrom
thence thevoyagersunder hiscommand discovered further
andnamed thelargeislands Malaita, Guadalcanal, San
Crist-oval, andthe lesser islands, Sesarga, which isSavo,
Florida with itsislets, Ulawa, andthesmall islands near
San Cristoval. Tothese hegavethename oftheSolomon
Islands, tomark hisconjecture,ortosuggestthe belief, that
hehaddiscovered thesource oftheriches ofSolomon. In
hissecond voyageof1595, undertaken forthepurposeof
colonizingtheSolomon Islands, Mendana discovered Santa
Cruz, andattemptedtoform asettlement there;anattempt
abandoned aftertwomonths, inconsequenceofhisdeath and
thesickness oftheremnant ofhiscrews. Quiros hadbeen
with Mendana, andwas allowed in1606 tocarry outa
project hehadbeen continually urgingofrecovering and
colonizingtheSolomon group.Fortune however madehim
thediscoverer oftheNew Hebrides, when hebelieved himself
tohave reached thegreatAustral Continent, intheisland
which still bears thename hegaveitofEspirituSanto.
The firstMelanesian islands however thathesawwere those
nowknown astheBanks' Islands, oneofwhich, Santa Maria,
retains thename hegaveit :Torres, afterpartingfrom Quiros,
sawandnamed theTorres Islands. After aninterval ofmore
than acentury andahalf,theFrench voyager Bougainville,
in1768, added Pentecost, Lepers' Island, andMalikolo tothe
discoveryofQuiros, naming thegrouptheGreat Cyclades,
andfound thegreatislands ofChoiseul andBougainville
beyondthose discovered inthe firstvoyageofMendana.

designation ofthechiefs inYsabel, where itisnow entirelyoutofplace.This
isthelesseasyofexplanation,astheother native words given appeartobe
thosenow inuse. ImayaddthatIhave discussed theaccounts ofMendana's
discoveries, asrelated inBurney's andDalrymple's collections, with natives of
theSolomon andSanta Cruz Islands;butunfortunately mynotes onthis

that thelargeisland which hassomehowgotthename of

Ndeni, fromwhich theNitendi ofthecharts hasprobably

.Manyofthese islands areeasily

,butQuiros
was ledbyhisinformation tolook forthelarge country
ofwhich hewasinsearch towards thesouth, andhethought
hefound itinwhat henamed Tierra Austral delEspiritu
Santo. This island, nowcommonly known asSanto, hasthe
native name ofMarina. Thiswasnotthe firstlandofthe
New Hebrides seenbyQuiros;afterhaving apparentlyseen
thelightofavolcano inthenight, hefound himself inthe

1Ihavemyselfwitnessed thearrival ofeleven canoes fromTikopia among
theBanks' Islands. Themen saidtheyhadcome toseethe islands, and

Shortlybefore thisacanoe fromTikopia hadbeen driven bythewind toMota,
andthemen inhermostkindly treated, andthesamething hadhappened
before andhashappened since. The difference insize,manner, language and
dressbetween theTikopians andBanks' Islanders wasconspicuous. Thetrue
name ispretty certainly Chikopia,since theMotapeoplelearntSikopia from
their visitors;twoFijianislands areCikobia =Thikombia.

found thattheEeef Islanders ofSanta Cruz visited Taumako andTikopia.It
isexcusable atsighttotake thePouro ofQuiros forBauro inSanCristoval,
but inmyopinion theattemptedidentification mustcompletelyfail. In
the firstplace, Pouro andBauro arefarfrombeingthesame insoundwhen the
confusion ofEnglish spellingisgotridof;Quiros would never write ouforau.
Secondly, Bauro isnotandnever wasthenative name ofSanCristoval;itis
aname picked upbyEuropeans,Ibelieve byBishop SelwynofNew Zealand,
andadoptedforEuropean convenience. Gallego calls, andproperly,apart
onlyoftheisland Paubro.Thirdly,arrows withpointsinform ofaknife

withEspiritu Santomake upthenorthern New Hebrides are,
Maewo, Aurora Island
;Araga,Pentecost Island;andOmba,

1Quiros named seven islands before hereached Espiritu Santo: San
Kaymundo, LosPortales deBelen, LaVergel, LasLagrimasdeSanPedro,
ElPilar deZaragoza, Santa Maria, andNuestra Senora delaLuz. Thetwo
latter alone areknown. Blighnamed Ureparaparaafter himself, Saddle Island
andSugarloaf Island(probably thePillar ofQuiros) after naturalfeatures, and
Great Banks' Island, withthewholegroup,after SirJoseph Banks. Besides the
geographical names, these islands havemostlythree setsofnames. Anisland

Pentecost aisreallythepreposition'at'
;Omba withthesame

therefore towriteRagaaswell asOmba, butcustom inthese
matters must beallowed toprevail. The interest ofthe
pointliesintheconnexion shewn bythecommon useof
thisprepositioninplace-namesbetween Melanesia, theMalay
ArchipelagoandMadagascar. Ethnological and historical
questionsareinseparablefrom theconsideration ofplace-
names;forexample,thequestions whether theBauro of
theSolomon Islands isthesame with theBouro, properly
Buru, near theMoluccas, orwhether Futuna oftheNew
Hebrides isnamed after Futuna, Home's Island. About one
thing however there oughttobenodisagreement; however
difficult itmaybetoascertain anative name and itsortho-
graphy, European names should bewritten inthelanguage
towhich they belong;San Cristoval, orCristobal, not
Christoval;Espiritu Santo, notSpirito Santo orSt.Esprit;
andwhere French names areretained, Contrariete Island and
CapeZelee.
Between thetime ofthediscoveryoftheSolomon Islands
byMendana andthetime inwhich the visits ofwhalers,
traders andmissionaries have becomefrequent, within the
lastthirtyorforty years, verylittle ifanythingatallwas

Itisveryinterestingtherefore toenquireinwhatparticulars
theSpaniards' account ofwhatthey discovered differs from
what would berecorded byrecent visitors. Theplace-names
mentioned, with lesserror than iscommon now, arethose still
inuse,Malaita forMala, Uraba forUlawa, Paubro forBauro,
AguareforOwarii. Thenames ofpersons mentioned aresuch
asarenow inuse;oneofthefewwords notnames to

exceptatSanCristoval, where darts arementioned;inrecent
times avoyagerwould nothave found bows and arrows

reports opencannibalism atYsabel and Florida, whereas
nomodern visitor would have seen itexceptatSanCristoval.
Nakedness issaidbyGallegotohave beencomplete,apoint

forlapsesofmemoryononesideandexaggerationoffacton
theother, thepeople, language,customs andcondition ofthe
peopleintheSolomon Islands have notchangedsince
Mendana'sdiscoveryof1567I
.
Theaccount ofthe visit ofMendana toSanta Cruz in
1595and oftheSpanish attempttoform asettlement is
ample anddetailed;and itwasremarked byBishop Patteson,
whowasprobablythefirstEuropeanafterMendana'spartyto
goabout thenativevillages,thatwhat heobserved corre-
sponded closely withtheSpanishrecord. Itisonlywithin the
lasttenyears that,bythecourageandenterpriseofthepresent
Missionary Bishop John Selwyn,theisland ofSanta Cruzhas
again become opentofriendly,andunhappilyalso tomis-
chievous, approach. Thepresentwriter hasgone through
theaccount ofMendana's visitwith natives ofSanta Cruz,
whose comments werecertainly interesting. Onepointmay
bementioned;theSpaniards, failingtogetthepeopleofthe
main island tolearn theirlanguage,sent tokidnap,after
thefashion which from thebeginning seems tohave been
natural toEuropean visitors, some boysfromtheneighbouring
Reef Islands, whomtheyhadobserved tobemoreintelligent
1Mr.Woodford, inFurther Explorations intheSolomon Islands, has
brought forward information from theJournal ofCatoira, chiefpurserof
Mendana's fleet. From this itappears that theuseofthebetel-nut was
already established. Another native word, nambolo, apig,also occurs.
Much maybelearnt astothepresent condition oftheSolomon Islanders

than those ofSanta Cruz. When thiswas related toa
mixed groupofSanta Cruz andReef IslandboysatNorfolk
Island, itwasatonce declared thattheSpaniards werequite
right,thattheSanta Cruzpeople nowthink theKeefIslandboys
sharperthan theirown;because itisthecustom oftheir
fathers totakethem withthem ontheirvoyages, which
Santa Cruzmen donot do.Theveryshortstayofthe
Spaniards,soonassuminghostile relations, cannot bethought
tohave affected native lifeatall;thelooms with which
theyweave their mats, their fowls,common tilllatelytoother
islands with them, andmanyotherthingsinwhich a
difference hasbeen observed, arementioned intheSpanish
narrative. There isnothingintheaccount ofthediscoveries
ofQuiros intheBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides toshew
anydifference between thecondition ofthenativepeople
then and inthelater times, whentheyhavebecome well
known toEuropeans;but itmaybeobserved that the
Spaniards begantokidnap,doubtless withgood intentions,
andtorecognise the'devil'ofthenatives.
Intheinterval between thediscoveries ofMendana and
Quiros andthe visits ofwhalers andmissionaries inthe
present century,there iseveryreason tobelieve that all
memory and tradition ofwhite menhaddiedawayinthe
Solomon Islands andSanta Cruzl
;Europeans appeared again
asperfect strangers. Weareable therefore toconjecture
howthe firstexplorers appearedtothenatives, whenweknow
howwehave ourselvesappeared. Totheoldvoyagers,as
1Bishop SelwynofNew Zealand beganhismissionary voyagesin1849,
andvisited theSolomon Islands in1850 ;helanded onsixtyislands in1857,
inwhichyeartheBanks' Islands became wellknown tohim. In1861Bishop
Patteson,inH.M.S.Cordelia, became acquaintedwith Florida andYsabel,
theyearlyvisits oftheMelanesian Missionhavingbeforestoppedshort at
Guadalcanar. From thatyear forward thework oftheMission hasbeen
regularlycarried onwithin thelimits ofYsabel tothewest, andMae,
later Pentecost, tothesouth. When thepresentwriter made hisfirstvoyage
intheMissionvessel, theSouthern Cross, in1863, Bishop Patteson was
generally conversant with thepeople andthelanguagesoftheislands from
NewZealand toYsabel.

tolater discoverers, itwasamatter ofcourse thathitherto
unknown countries should befound, andthattheyshould be
inhabited bymen unlike themselves;buttothenatives
itwasastrange thing-that there should beanymen unlike
themselves, oranyunknown land forthem tocome from.
There arestillnatives inthese islands whoremember when a
whitemanwas first seen,andwhat hewastaken tobe.In
theBanks' Islands, forexample,thenatives believed theworld
toconsist oftheirowngroup, withtheTorres Islands, thethree
orfournorthern New Hebrides, andperhaps Tikopia, round
which theoceanspreadtillitwasshut inbythefoundations
ofthesky. The first vessels theyremember tohave seen
were whalers, which theydidnotbelieve tocome fromany
countryintheworld;theywere indeedquitesurethatthey
didnot,butmust have beenmade outatsea,because they
knew thatnomen intheworld hadsuch vessels. Inthe
samewaytheywere surethatthevoyagerswerenotmen;if
they were theywould beblack. What were theythen?
Theywere ghosts, andbeing ghosts,ofnecessitythose ofmen
whohadlived intheworld. When Mr.Patteson firstlanded
atMota, theMissionparty havingbeen seen intheprevious
yearatVanua Lava, there wasadivision ofopinion among
thenatives;some saidthatthebrothers ofQathadreturned,
certainsupernatural beingsofwhom stories aretold;others
maintained thattheywereghosts.Mr.Patteson retired from
theheatandcrowd intoanempty house, theowner ofwhich
hadlatelydied;this settled thequestion,hewastheghost
ofthelatehouseholder, andknew hishome.Averyshort
acquaintancewith white visitors shews that theyarenot
ghosts,butcertainlydoes notshew that theyaremen;
theconjecturethen isthattheyarebeingsofanother order,
spiritsordemons, powerful nodoubt, butmischievous. A
ghostwould bereceived inapeacefulandrespectful manner,
asEuropeanvisitors have alwaysinthe first instance been
received;abeingnotaliving man orghosthaswonderful

toshootingatthem, theywerenotmen.andthearrows could

theeldermen have, from theirownpointofview atleast,
beenright;iron, tobacco, calico, awider knowledgeofthe
world, have notcompensatednativepeoplefornew diseases
andtheweakeningofsocial bonds1
.White visitors have not
meant todothenatives wrong,buttheyhave infactharmed
them, andhavenotearned moralrespectatanyrategenerally
from them. Europeans have from thebeginningofinter-
course with Melanesian natives kidnapped them, andhave
persuaded themselves thatthey were doing them aservice
bybringing them intowhat iscalled contact with civilization;
thenatives havefromthefirstresented thekidnappingoftheir
sons,and theirsons,however much theymayhavewished to

somepeople thepowerofspeakingalittle'pigeon English,'for

Toavoyager among these Melanesian islands who has

tillnatives returned from residence withEuropeans. When theNukapu
men, whosekidnapping wastheimmediate cause ofthedeath ofBishop
Patteson, escaped fromFijiandmade theirwaytotheir nativeisland,
dysentery, before unknown, broke outthere. Theabsence ofanative name
forthisandother diseases, istosome extent atleast aproofofrecent in-
troduction. Within myown recollectionsyphilis,orthevenereal disease
which wastaken forit,wasunknown intheislands visited bytheMela-
nesian Mission, except atSanCristoval, where alone intercourse with whalers
and traders hadbeen considerable. Ithaslately becomewidely known,

interesting with allthesuffering they bring;inMota there

THERE willbenoattempt made here todealwith the
EthnologyofMelanesia. TheoriginoftheMelanesian
people,intheir various seats and intheir various divisions,
maybetaken tobeunknown;astheythemselvesapparently
havenotraditions andnoopinionsabout thematter, andin
the stories whichpassamong themrepresentthemselves to
have been created where theyare.Thevarietyoftheir
languages,and toamuch lessextent oftheir artsand

theislands theynow inhabit;anexamination oftheir lan-
guagesdiscovers averyconsiderableunderlying sameness;
andthepresent bookmaybetakenperhapsasanevidence
ofalarge generalresemblance inthereligiousbeliefs and
practices,thecustoms andwaysoflife,whichprevailinthe
islands which arehereembraced inacommon view. As
knowledgeextends and detailed information isbroughtin
from allsides, aconnexion willnodoubt betraced with

theother awoman, theparentsofmankind. Itisofmore
consequencetoobserve themeaningofthewords bywhich
thepeopleofthevarious islands describe themselves asmen.
Itissaidsometimes thatpeoplediscovered inisolation from
others callthemselvesmerely'men,' without aname fortheir
race ornation, asiftheythoughtthemselves theonlymen in
theworld. InMelanesia, when natives were firstaskedwho
they were, theyanswered*men,' meaningthattheywerenot
demons orghosts,butliving men
;andtheydidsobecause
theydidnotbelieve their visitors tobemen,butghoststhem-
selves, ordemons, orspirits belongingtothesea.
Inthenative view ofmankind, almost everywhereinthe
islands which arehere under consideration, nothingseems
more fundamental than thedivision ofthepeopleintotwoor
more classes, which areexogamous, and inwhich descent is
countedthroughthemother. Thisseems tostand foremost
asthenative looks outuponhisfellow men;theknowledge
ofitformsprobablythe first social conception which shapes

itisnottoomuch tosaythat thisdivision isthefoundation

There is,however, onevery remarkable exceptiontothis
generalrule ofdivision intheSolomon Islands;itisnot
tobefound inUlawa, Ugi, andpartsofSan Cristoval,
Malanta, andGuadalcanar, adistrict inwhich thelanguages
alsoform agroup bythemselves, andinwhich adifference in
thedecorative artofthepeople,andintheappearanceofthe
people themselves, thoroughly Melanesian asthey are,can
hardly escapenotice. Inthisregion,theboundaries ofwhich
areatpresent unknown, there isnodivision ofthepeopleinto
kindreds aselsewhere, anddescent follows thefather. This is
sostrangethat tomyselfitseemed foratime incredible, and
nothingbuttherepeateddeclarations ofanative who iswell
acquainted with thedivision whichprevailsinother groups
ofislands, was sufficient tofixitwithmeasanascertained
fact. Theparticularorlocal causes which havebroughtabout
thisexceptionalstate ofthingsareunknown;thefactofthe
exceptionisavaluable onetonote *.
Speaking generally,itmaybesaidthat toaMelanesian
man allwomen, ofhisowngenerationatleast, areeither
sisters orwives, totheMelanesian woman allmen areeither
brothers orhusbands. Anexcellent illustration ofthis is
giveninthestoryofTasofromAurora intheNewHebrides,
inwhich Qatu discovers andbringstohiswifetwinboys,
children ofhisdead sister: hiswifeasks, 'Are thesemy
children ormyhusbands ?'andQatuanswers,'Yourhusbands
tobesure, theyaremysister's children.' Inthat island
there aretwodivisions ofthepeople;Qatuandhiswifecould
notbeofthesame, Qatuandhissister andherchildren must
beofthesame;theboystherefore were possible husbands of

however, haveadvanced toagnatic descent.' Rev. L.Fison.

Qatu's wife,buthadtheybelongedtotheother division their
agewould havemade hercountthem herchildren rather than
herbrothers. Itmust notbeunderstood that aMelanesian
regardsallwomen who arenotofhisown division asinfact
hiswives, orconceives himself tohaverights which hemay
exercise inregardtothosewomen ofthemwho areunmarried;
butthewomen whomaybehiswives bymarriage,andthose
whocannotpossiblybeso,stand inawidelydifferent relation
tohim;and itmaybeadded that allwomen whomaybecome
wives inmarriage andarenotyetappropriated,aretoacertain
extent looked uponbythosewhomaybetheirhusbands asopen
toamore orlesslegitimateintercourse. Infactappropriation
ofparticular women totheirownhusbands, thoughestablished
byeverysanction ofnative custom, hasbynomeans sostrong
ahold innativesociety, norinallprobability anythinglike
sodeepafoundation inthehistoryofthenativepeople,as
theseverance ofeither sexbydivisions which moststrictly
limit theintercourse ofmenandwomen tothose ofthesection
orsections towhich they donotthemselvesbelong. Two
proofsorexemplificationsofthisareconspicuous, (i)There is
probablynoplaceinwhich thecommonopinionofMelanesians
approvestheintercourse ofunmarriedyouths andgirlsasa
thing goodinitself, thoughitallows itasathingtobe
expected andtobeexcused;butintercourse within thelimit
which restrains from marriage, where twomembers ofthe
same division areconcerned, isacrime,isincest. InFlorida
inoldtimes themanwould havebeen killed, andthewoman
made aharlot;nowthat theseverityofancient manners is
relaxed, money andpigscancondone the offence, butmuch
more than isexacted ifaman isfoundsinningwith onewho
might possibly havebecome hiswife. IntheBanks' Islands,
where thedivisions ofthepeoplearetwo,ifitbecame known
thattwomembers ofoneofthemhadbeenguiltyofthis dis-

withwhom hehadoffended, soastoappeasetheiranger,and
'fence against'thefault. Cases ofincest ofthiskind were
alwaysrareinalltheislands, sostrongwasthefeeling against
intercourse within thekin.(2)Thefeeling ontheotherhand
thattheintercourse ofthesexes wasnatural where theman
andwoman belongedtodifferent divisions, wasshewn bythat
feature ofnative hospitalitywhich providedaguestwith a
temporarywife. That this isdonenow orhaslatelybeen
done isreadilydenied intheSolomon andBanks' Islands, but
isnotdenied intheNorthern New Hebrides;there canbe
little doubt that itwascommon everywhere.Butthewoman

Itwillbeconvenient inthemoreparticulartreatment of

aremore than two. Thesametwodivisions runthroughthe

Asconcerns thesecondpointinquestion,itisapparentthat
thestrict ruleofexogamyasregardsthekinleavesmarriage
opentothosewho areverynearinblood;foraman isnotof
kin tohisown children, andaman isnotofkintohis
brother's children. Butalthoughitistheintermarriageof
sogoi, members ofthesame veve, that isstrictly forbidden,
andthedescent isalwayscounted bythemother, yetthe
blood connexion with thefather andthefather's near relations
isnever outofsight. Consequentlythemarriageofthose
who arenear inblood, though theyarenotsogoiandmay
lawfully marry,isdiscountenanced. InMota, forexample,
thechildren ofabrother and sister arethoughttoonear to
marry. Thebrother and sister areboth ofone veve, A,as
children ofonemother;thechildren ofthe sister areofher
veve,A;thebrother's children areoftheveve B,following
their mother, whomust needs beoftheother side ofthe
house. Itappears then thatthetwo cousins, children ofa
brother and sister, arenotsogoi, onebeingAandtheother B,
andthattheycanmarry.Buttheywillnot;thematch

andManukama arenames ofonekema, oroftwo divisions

partsofoneoriginal.Itisnotthecase inFlorida thatan

butthesettlement offoreignershas socomplicated the

Yettheforeigners have undoubtedly broughtwiththem a
distinct sense ofkinship withoneorother ofthelocal kema.
The strict rule ofexogamyisnotasufficient limit tothe

Takua, aconsiderable chief, took tohimself thedaughter

that theoriginofthis restraint was recent andwell re-

would stillgivehisname andsay,'Wecannot eatSo-and-

inMalanta near Ulawa, where, asinFlorida also, aman

Thesystem bywhich theMelanesianpeoplearethusdivided
intoexogamous groupsinwhich descent follows themother,
receives ofcourse thename ofaMatriarchalsystem ;but it
,must beunderstood thatthemother isinnowaythehead of
thefamily. Thehouse ofthefamilyisthe father's, the
gardenishis,theruleandgovernmentarehis;itisintothe
father's house that theyoung bridegroomtakes hiswife, if
hehasnotonereadyofhisown. The closestrelationship,
however, accordingtonative notions, isthatwhich exists
between thesister's sonandthemother'sbrother, because the
mother whotransmits thekinshipisnotable torender the
service which amancangive.Aman's sons arenotofhis
own kin,thoughheactsafather'sparttothem;butthetie
between hissister's children andhimself hasthestrengthof
thetraditional bond ofallnativesociety, that ofkinship
throughthemother. Theyouthashebeginstofeel social
wants, overandabove thefoodand shelter that hisfather
gives him, looks tohismother's brother asthemale re-
presentativeofhiskin. Itiswellknown that inFijithe
vasu, the sister's son, hasextraordinary rights with his
maternal uncle. Thecorresponding rightismuch lessqon-
spicuous andimportant than thisintheMelanesian Islands
west ofFiji ;but itisamatter ofcourse that thenephew
should look tohismother's brother forhelpofevery kind,
andthat theuncle should lookuponhis sister's sonashis
special care; thecloseness ofthis relation isfundamental.
Theconnexion ofkinship through themother with thegreat
exogamous group, andthatofbloodthrough thefather with
hisfamily, thus stand inclearrecognition, andtoacertain
extentnecessarily conflict onewith another. Theconnexion

Theuncle ismaraui tohissister's child, thenepheworniece

theavoidance ismutual;ifthetwochance tomeet inapath,
thewoman willstepoutofitandstand with herback turned

hisfather-in-law, norawoman hers.Aman doesnotavoid
hiswife's brother, butwillnotsleep withhim;hedoesnot
avoid hisson's wife, orhisown wife's sister. Boys andgirls
who areengaged generallyavoid oneanother, butthrough
shyness,notbyrule.Where thepersons above mentioned do
