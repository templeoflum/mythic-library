IThasbeenmyendeavour inthefollowing pagesto
bring togethertheresults ofsuch observations asmany
years' acquaintance with Melanesianpeoplehasenabled
metomake. Ihadoncehopedtohave been able togive
something more likeafullaccount ofthe beliefs and
practicesofthenatives ofthose islands concerning which
Ihavehadtheopportunityofcollectinginformation;but
mystayuponmylastreturn totheMelanesian Mission
wastooshort forthis,andIhavenow toputforthwhat I
know tobevery incomplete.
Myobservations andenquiries were carried on,andmy
notes were made, intheyears from1863, when Ifirst
visited theislands, to1887,when IlefttheMission;partly
intheMelanesian Islands, butmostlyinNorfolk Island,
where natives ofmanyofthese islands have formany
years beenbrought togetherforinstruction. Twiceduring
thisperiodImade with natives ofthevarious islands a
systematic enquiryintothereligiousbeliefs andpracticesof
theMelanesians, andthesocial regulations andconditions
prevailing amongthem. Onthefirstoccasion Ihad, asre-
gards theBanks' Islands, theveryvaluable assistance ofa
native whowasagrown youthbefore hispeople hadbeen
atallaffected byintercourse withEuropeansorhadheard

brieflyintheJournal oftheAnthropologicalInstitute of
February,1881;andthese werecarefully reviewed byme
duringmylaststayinNorfolk Island in1866and1867.
Iwassofortunate then astomeet there several oldfriends
andpupilswhohadcome down, fortheir health's sakeand
forother reasons, after aresidence asteachers amongtheir
ownpeople. Theyhadbeenlivingintheir various islands
inapositionandatanagewhich would make them ac-
quaintedwith theviews andhabits oftheir countrymen,
andtheywere able, and, Ibelieve, entirely willing,tocom-
municatefreely whattheyknew. Ithappenedthus that I
wasable togothroughthesubjects which aretreated ofin
thisbookwith native instructors fromtheSolomon Islands,
theBanks' Islands, andtheNorthern NewHebrides;with
Marsden Manekalea from Ysabel, Benjamin Bele from
Florida, Joseph Wate from Saa,Walter Woser from Motlav,
Arthur Arudulewari from Aurora, Lewis Tariliu from
Pentecost, Martin Tangabe fromLepers'Island;every one
ofthem, inmyopinion,acompetent andtrustworthy witness,
thoughallwere notequally intelligent.
Ithasbeenmypurposetosetforth asmuch aspossible
what nativessayabout themselves, notwhat Europeans
sayabout them. Forthisreason, thoughtheresults ofmy
ownpersonalobservations aregiven,Ihave refrained from
askingorrecording, exceptinafew instances where
acknowledgmentismade, theinformation whichmy
colleaguesintheMission would have abundantly and
willingly imparted. Noonecanbemore sensible than
myselfoftheincompleteness andinsufficiencyofwhat I
venture topublish ;Iknow that Imust havemademany
mistakes andmissed much that Imight have learnt. I
have feltthetruth ofwhat Mr.Fison, latemissionaryin

Fiji,towhom Iamindebted formuch instruction, has
written :*When aEuropeanhasbeenlivingfortwo or

thatheknows allabout them;when hehasbeen tenyears
orsoamongst them,ifhebeanobservant man, hefinds
thatheknows verylittle about them, and sobeginsto
learn.' Myowntime oflearninghasbeen alltooshort.
Ihaveendeavoured asfaraspossibletogivethenatives'
account ofthemselves bygiving what Itookdown from
theirlipsandtranslating whattheywrote themselves. It
islikelythatunder thecircumstances ofsuchenquiries
much oftheworst sideofnative lifemaybeoutofsight,
andtheview given seemgenerally more favourable than
mightbeexpected;ifitbeso,Ishall notregretit.
Ishould havebeengladifspace hadallowed metotreat
atgreater lengththesubjectofthenative Arts ofLife,and
tohavegiven more oftheTales, which throw somuch
lightuponnative lifeandthought. Thecomparisonofthe
Melanesianlanguages, customs, beliefs, and arts,with those
oftheislands ofthePacific andIndian Oceans, will fixthe
ethnological place oftheMelanesianpeople while itaids
thegeneral studyofmankind.
Inconclusion, thisbook, thoughwritten byamissionary,
with his fullshare oftheprejudices andpredilections
belongingtomissionaries,isnotmeant tohavewhat is
generallyunderstood tobeamissionarycharacter;butthe
writer ispersuadedthatoneofthe first duties ofamis-
sionaryistotrytounderstand thepeople amongwhom he
