DEATH. BURIAL. AFTER DEATH.
THAT death isthepartingofsoulandbody, andthatthe
departedsoul continues inanintelligent andmore orless
active existence, iswhat Melanesianseverywhere believe;
butwhat that iswhich inlifeabides with thebody, andin
deathdepartsfromit,andwhich, speakingofitinEnglish,
wecallthe soul,theyfind itverydifficult toexplain. Like
people verymuch more advanced than themselves, theyhave
notinthe firstplaceaperfectlyclearconceptionofwhat itis;
and inthesecondplace,likeotherpeople, they usewords to
representtheseconceptions whichthey acknowledgetobe
more orlessfigurativeandinexact, when theprecise meaning
ofthem issoughtfor.Nor isitanywonder that, believing
thatsuch athingaswhatwecallasoul exists inconnexion
with thebodywhichthey see,theyspeakofandconceive of
thesoulwhen separatefrom thebodyasifitwere insome
formandshapevisible totheeyes. Thinking,toMelanesia-!!
natives atany rate,islikeseeing ;what isthoughtofmust
havesome form tobethoughtofin;andavisible thing that
hasalikeness tothatwhich isthoughtofoffers itsname asa
convenient means ofexpression.'Supposethat there are
people who callthesoulashadow, Idonotinthe least
believe thatthey think theshadow asoul orthe soul a
shadow;butthey usetheword shadowfigurativelyfor
thatbelongingtomanwhich islike hisshadow, definitely
individual andinseparable from him, but unsubstantial.
TheMota wordweuseforsoul isinMaori ashadow, but


248 Death. Burial. AfterDeath.[CH.
noMotamanknows that itevermeant that. Infactmy
belief isthat intheoriginal languagethisword didnot
definitely mean either soulorshadow, buthadameaning one
canconceive butnotexpress, which hascome outinone
language meaning shadow, andintheother meaning some-
thinglike soul,i.e.second self1
.'SoMr.Fison writes.*The
Fijianword forsoul isyalo,that forshadowyaloyalo.Ihave
notbeen able tofindanytrace ofthebelief thatshadow and
soul areindentical. Ibelieve that Williams' remark about
the"twospirits"wastheresult ofaconfusion inhismind
concerning yalo andyaloyalo' The civilized observer is
always readytoassume thatthesavagetakes achildish view
andhasabsurd beliefs, when allthewhile, ifthesavagecould
puthim toaclose examination, hisownconceptions would
befoundveryindistinct and hisexpressions mainly figur-
ative. Manyavoyager,notanobserver, carries awayasa
sortofjokethestorythat thenatives think their shadows
aretheir souls,who could not tellexactly what hemeans
bytheword'soul'which heuses himself. Itmaysuffice
tomake thestatement that, whatever word theMelane-
sianpeopleuse forsoul, theymean something esseutially
belongingtoeach man's nature which carries lifetohis
bodywithit,and istheseatofthought andintelligence,
exercisingtherefore power which isnotofthebody and is
invisible initsaction. Further understandingoftheir con-
ceptionscannot well failtofollow from thestudyofthe
words theyuse.
Ithasbeenshown(page121)thatamongMelanesians there
isauniversal belief intheexistence ofpersonal intelligent
beingsofpower superiortothat ofmen,andwithout bodies
such asarethebodies ofmankind;andthat thesebeings,
whom wecallspirits,aredistinct from thedisembodiedspirits
orsouls ofdead'menwhich wecallghosts.Itisnotsur-
prising, therefore, that thesamewordwhich isused forspirit
should beused also todescribe thesoul ofman while itis
clothed withandanimates hisbody. Thesoul ofaliving

When aman fainted thetalegihadgone out,but liferemained.
Lifedepends onthepresenceofthetalegi inthebody,health
depends uponitssound condition. Aghost candamagethe

then theman falls sick,and hisbodyisweak, ortheghost

ofthetalegi beingtaken ordamaged;itwould notbesaidof
ulcers forexample. Thetalegi hasnoform, but itislikea
reflection orashadow. TheMota atai isnodoubt theMaori
ata,which means ashadow, butatainever means shadow in
Mota, nor isniniai, which means shadow and reflection, ever
used forsoul. Atthesame timedamage wasthoughttobe
done tothebodybymeans oftheshadow orreflection, as
when theshadow felluponacertain stone(pages 182, 4),ora
man's facewasreflected inacertainspringofwater(page 186).
Thepowerofthespirit,vm9belongingtothestone orthe
springcouldlayholdonthemanbyhisshadow and reflection,
asthepowerofaghostcouldgetaholdonamanbya
fragmentofhisfood, theshadow beinginawayanother
personoftheman. Butthat theshadow wasthesoulwas
neverthought. SoinSaatheytalk ofaghost snatching
awaytheshadow ofachild that starts insleep, anda
doctor undertakes tobringitback;but, saysJoseph Wate,
who tells thetale,'they sayshadow andtheymean some-
thing else, fortheshadow ofthechild isseen allthewhile.'
Theuseoftheword ataiinMota seemsproperly andorigin-
allytohave been tosignify something peculiarlyand
intimatelyconnected with aperson andsacred tohim,some-
thingthathehassethisfancy uponwhen hehasseen itin
what hasseemed tohimawonderful manner, orsome onehas
shewn ittohim assuch. Whatever thething mightbethe
man believed ittobethereflection ofhisownpersonality;
heandhisatai flourished, suffered, lived anddiedtogether.
Butthewordmust notbesupposed tohave been borrowed
from thisuseandapplied secondarilytodescribe thesoul;the
word carries asense with itwhich isapplicablealike tothat


xv.]Souls. 251
secondself,thevisibleobjectsomysteriouslyconnected with
theman,andtothis invisible second selfwhich wecallthe
soul. There isanother Mota word, tamaniu, which hasalmost
ifnotquite thesamemeaning1asataihaswhen itdescribes
something animate orinanimate which amanhascome tobe-
lieve tohaveanexistenceintimatelyconnected with hisown.
Theword tamaniu maybetaken tobeproperly'likeness/ and
thenounform oftheadverb tama, as,like. Itwasnotevery
oneinMotawhohad histamaniu;onlysomemen fancied
thattheyhadthisrelation toalizard, asnake, oritmightbe
astone;sometimes thething wassoughtforandfound by
drinkingtheinfusion ofcertain leaves andheaping together
thedregs ;thenwhateverliving thing was firstseen inor
upontheheapwasthetamaniu. Itwaswatched butnotfed
orworshipped;thenatives believed that itcame atcall,and
thatthe lifeofthemanwasbound upwith the lifeofhis
tamaniu, ifaliving thing,orwith itssafety;should itdie,or
ifnotliving getbroken orbelost, themanwould die.
Hence incaseofsickness theywould send toseeifthetamaniu
wassafeand well. Thisword hasnever been usedapparently
forthesoul inMota;butinAurora intheNew Hebrides it
istheaccepted equivalent.Itiswellworth observingthat
both the ataiandthetamaniu, and itmaybeadded the
Motlavtalegi,issomething which hasasubstantial existence
ofitsown, aswhen asnake orstone isaman's ataiortamaniu;
asoulthenwhen called bythese names isconceived ofas
somethinginawaysubstantial. There isanother word used
inMota, neverappliedtothesoulofman,butveryillustrative
ofthenativeconceptions,andcommon alsotoAurora, where it
isusedwith aremarkable application;thisword isnunuai.
InMota itistheabidingorrecurrent impressiononthe
senses that iscalled anunuai;amanwhohasheard some
startlingscream inthecourse ofthedayhas itringinginhis
ears;thescream isoverandthesound isgone,butthenunuai
remains;amanfishingforflying-fish paddlesalldayalone in

werecaught, thoughtheline isnolonger onhisneck;this is
thenunuai oftheline. Tothenative itisnotamerefancy,
itisreal,butithasnoform orsubstance. Apig, therefore,
ornaments orfoodhave anunuai;butapighasnoatai, or
may hesitatingly andcarelesslybesaid tohave one. This
word isnodoubt thesame asniniai, shadow orreflection,
meaningnotshade, which ismalumalu, butthedefinitefigure
castbytheinterceptionofraysoflightupontheground,or
formed byreflection inthewater. There isnoconfusion in
thenative mind between ashadow andareflection, butthey
usetheoneword todescribe that definite individual something
which, itself insubstantial,issocloselyconnected with the
substance thatgivesitform.
Thisword, intheform nunu,isused inAurora todescribe
thefancied relation ofaninfant tosome thingorpersonfrom
which orfromwhom itsoriginissomehow derived. Awoman
before herchild isborn fancies that acocoa-nut, bread-fruit,
orsome suchthinghassomeoriginalconnexion with her
infant. When thechild isborn itisthenunu ofthecocoa-nut,
orwhatever itmay be,andasitgrows upitmustbynomeans
eatthatthing,oritwillbeill;noonethinks that there is
anyrealconnexion inthewayofparentage,butthechild isa
kind ofecho. There isanother wayinwhich achild isthe
nunu ofapersondeceased. ThusArudulewari isthenunu ofa
boywhom hismother brought upandwhowasmuch beloved
byher. Thisboydiednotlongbefore Arudulewari wasborn,
andthen themother believed thatherfoster-child hadwished
tocome back toher,andthattheinfant was bisnunu. But
Arudulewari isnotthatperson, nor, ashesays,ishissoul
supposedtobethesoulofthedeadboy;hehimself isthenunu,
theecho orreflection of-him. SoVilemalas, aname which
means'
Bring-the-day-after,'wasborn afteranadoptedchild
ofhismother's hadbeen killed andnotbroughtback tillthe
day after, andheisthenunu oftheslainperson come inhis

bottom. Ifheseesanything- there, acrab orcuttle-fish
perhaps,hefancies that ishisrealorigin andbeginning* ;he
getsmana, supernatural power, fromit,andpigswillmultiply
tohim. AtMaewo, Aurora, nunu isnever thesoul;that is
tamaniu\ and itisaveryremarkablething that thebody
isthought tobetheintegumentofthesoul. Itisastrange
thingthat intheislands oftheNew Hebrides nearest to
Aurora, inPentecost andLepers' Island, thewordtamtegi
isused forsoul, forthis isnodoubt theMota tamate, dead
man;thenatives, however, havepersistedintheir assertion
thattheyhavenoother word.
We arenowpreparedtofollow thecorpseofthedead
Melanesian tohisburial, andhissoul after itsseparation from
thebodytotheabode ofthedead;and itisprobablybetter
todothisbytakingthefuneral customs andthe beliefs
concerning thestate after death togetherastheyarefound in
thevarious islands. Itwillbeseenthatthere isaconsiderable
agreementboth incustoms and beliefs, andauniversalconsent^
about someparticulars,such asinbelief inthecontinued
existence oftheseparated soul,andinthepracticeofcom-
memoratingthedeadbyfeasts atwhich someportionoffood
isoffered tothem. IntheSolomon Islands theghost, being
theprincipal objectofworship, occupies,ashasbeenshewn, a
much higher placeinthereligiousworld ofthenatives than
itdoes intheislands which lietotheeastward, andonthat
account itisdesirable, beforeentering upon details, todraw
thedistinction between thetwo classes ofghosts which is
generally recognizedintheformer islands. Thedistinction is
j
between ghostsofpowerandghostsofnoaccount, between
those whosehelpissought andtheir wrathdeprecated,and
those fromwhom nothingisexpectedand towhom noob-
servance isdue.Among livingmen there aresomewhostand
outdistinguishedforcapacityinaffairs, success inlife,valour

which they have, andwhich arederived fromcommunication
with thoseghostsofthedeadgonebefore themwho arefull
ofthose samepowers. Onthedeath ofadistinguished man
hisghostretains thepowersthatbelongedtohim inlife,in
greater activity andwithstrongerforce;hisghosttherefore
ispowerfulandworshipful, andsolongasheisremembered

heisthetindalo ofFlorida, the Zio'aofSaa. Inevery society,
again,themultitude iscomposedofinsignificant persons,
*numerus frugesconsumere nati,' ofnoparticularaccount for
valour, skill, orprosperity. Theghostsofsuchpersonscon-
tinue their insignificance, and arenobodies after death as

ofdeadmen areghosts;theyaredreaded because allghostsare
awful, buttheygetnoworship andaresoononlythoughtof

IntheSolomon Islands, inFlorida, when aman dies, his
spirit, tarunga, becomes aghost, tindalo, andthebodyis

shipped and exercise muchspiritual activityintheworld as

InSavo, nearby,common men arethrown intotheseaasa
rule,andonlygreatmen buried. InFlorida thefuneral ofa
chief, orofonewho ismuch esteemed, isdelayedfortwo
daysafter death;and after thefuneral the relatives and
friends assemble tokilodatonatinoni mate, that istosay,to
partakeofafuneral feast,andtohanguponthedead man's
house hiscloth, hisaxes, spears, shield, andotherproperties,
heaping yamsandother foodupon theground. Atthefeast
abitofthefood isthrown intothe fireforthedeceased, with
the call,'This isforyou.' Asthemourners eat,theyare
anxious about swallowingthefood welldown;ifamorsel
sticks inanyone's throat, itisabutuli, aportent, theman
will die.When theyhang upthedeadman's arms onhis-
house, theymakegreatlamentations;allremains afterwards

With thesamefeeling theycutdown adead man's fruit-

that burial isabenefit totheghost;ifaman iskilled any-

ThestoryoftheOriginofDeath noticed intheaccount
ofSaa(page 260),has itsparallelintheBanks' Islands and
againintheNew Hebrides. At firstmennever died, but
when theyadvanced inlifetheycast their skins likesnakes
andcrabs, andcame outwithyouthrenewed. After atimea
woman growingoldwent toastream tochangeherskin;
accordingtosome shewasthemother ofQat,accordingto
others Ul-ta-marama, Change-skinoftheworld. Shethrew,
offheroldskin inthewater, andobserved that asitfloated
down itcaught againstastick. Then shewent home,
where shehad leftherchild. The child, however, refused to
recognize her,cryingthat itsmother wasanoldwoman not
likethisyoung stranger ;andtopacifythechild shewent after
hercastintegument andputiton.From thattimeman-
kind ceased tocasttheir skins and died. Inanother Banks'
Islandstorythiswoman isIroPuget,Bird's-nest Fern, the
wife ofMate, Death \There aremanyothers. Inonethe
cause oftheintroduction ofDeath wastheinconvenience of
thepermanenceofpropertyinthesame hands whilemen
changedtheir skins and lived forever. Qattherefore sent
forMate, whodwelt inPanoi, orbythesideofavolcanic

have togotoVanua Lava andnotbehurt. Death there-
forecame forth;theylaidhimonaboard, killed apig,and

andeatthefuneral feast. Onthe fifthdaywhen theconch

overMate andfound himgone;nothingbutbones remained.
Inthemeanwhile TangarotheFoolhadbeen settowatch
thewaytoPanoi, where thepaths tothelower andupper
worlds divided,lestMate should gobelow;thefool satin
front ofthewaytotheworld above, andletMate godown
toPanoi;allmenhave since followed Deathalongthatpath.
Anotherstorymakes thesame fool under hisname of
Tagilingelingethecause ofdeath, because when IroPuget
sethim toguardthewaytoPanoi inprospectofherown
death, hepointedoutthatwaytoherdescending ghost
instead ofthewayback totheworld, andsoshe,and allmen
after her, diedandnever came back tolife. InLakona,
partofSanta Maria, thestory goesthatMarawa stole a
woman whom Qathadmade(page 157);andinthenight
while heandsheweresleeping Qatcamequietly, pulledout
their teeth, andshaved their heads. Then hetookthehairy
plexusofthetree-fern andputitontheir heads, givingthe
names ofbaldness andofthe'second hair/ asgrayhairhas
since been called. Then hespread spider's web over their
eyes,sothatwhen theywoke inthemorningdimness was
over theirsight. Thewoman refused togoback tohim;so
inasonghecalled forbaldness, blindness, toothlessness, old
age,anddeath, because shehaddisobeyedhisword.
The soul, atai ortalegi, goesoutofthebodyinsome

isfound dead inthemorning ;when aman faints, mate mule,

Shecaughtthefluttering thing between herhands andran

Gauapeople, however, denythatpigshaveghosts1

interestingtoobserve how ajudgment uponadead man's

beingburied atMotlav, amanwhom thedeceased had ill
used followed with astone, andthrew itonthebody, crying
out,'Youhave illusedme,andpersecuted metokillme
youhave died first.' AtGauawhen agreatman died his
friends would notmake itknown,lestthosewhom hehad
oppressedshould come andspitathim after hisdeath, or
govgov him, standbickeringathimwith crookedfingersand
drawinginthelips,bywayofcurse. Relatives inMotlav
watch thegraveofamanwhose lifewasbad, lestsomeman
wronged byhimshould come atnight andbeatwith astone
uponthegrave, cursinghim. Sometimes thefriends will
have asham burial, andhidethegraveinwhich thecorpseis

Theghostwhen itleaves itsformerdwelling-place makes
itswaytoPanoi, towhich there aremany entrances, called
sura, inthevarious islands, some underground andunknown,
some wellknown, liketherock Aliali onthemountain at
Mota, volcanic vents ontheburninghillGarat over the
lake atGaua, andthegreat mountain ofVanua Lava, the
Sur-lav, greatsura. Theghosts congregateonpointsofland
before theirdeparture,aswell asatthemouth ofthesura,
where theyareheard dancing, singing, shouting andwhistling
with land-crabs' claws onmoonlight nights. Tothesepoints
oflandandthesura entrances toPanoi itwaspossiblefor
ghosts whohadalreadydescended toreturn, and itwas
thought bysome that they would come outtoreceive,
sometimes with dancing,thefreshly dead, shewthem their
various haunts, andconduct them totheunderworld. There
isalsothenotion thatthere aresuraappropriatedtoparticular
classes ofghosts;asthesuretupa, wheresimpleharmless

Aprecise andconsistent account ofthecondition ofghosts

perhapsisitreasonable toexpectit.But the stories of
descents toPanoi shew intheir relation what arethecommon
conceptionsinthenative mind. Itdoesmuch toreconcile
thevarying-accounts torecognisethetruth thatPanoi isnot
asingle receptaclethesame for all,andthat there isa
correspondingdistinction between one class ofghosts and
another. This isclearlybelieved atMotlav, wherethey say
thatwhen aghost goesdown thesura itismetbyanother
ghost, andaccordingtothecharacter oftheman inlife is
allowed toenter into Panoi, orsentback toanotherplace,
dreading which itgoestowander ontheearth. The true
Panoi isagood place, andthere isabadplacebesides which
issometimes meant when theword Panoi isused. Thus, ifa
manhaskilled another bytreacheryorwitchcraft, when after
death hedescends thesurahefinds himself withstood atthe
entrance toPanoi bytheghostofthemanhehaswronged;
heseesanother path leadingtothebadplace hedreads, andso
heturns back toearth. Ifonehaskilled agoodmanwithout
cause, thegoodman'sghostwithstands hismurderer;ifone
manhaskilled another infairfighthewillnotbewithstood
bytheman heslew;ifabadman slew abadmanboth
would betogether,butnotinthetruePanoi. This division
isvery importantthat there aresomeghosts who enter
Panoi, andsomewho arenotallowed toenter, these last
beingofbadcharacter. Very importantindeed also isit,as

these aretheywho eatexcrement andopentheirmouths for

thiskind ofjudgmentafter death. Theghost's pathleads
him tothevolcanic vents oftheburninghillGarat, andashe

him,ghostashealready is,todeath, then cuthim topieces,
and eachghostwill take apiece. They then puthim

ghostwhohasthegrievancewillhide thepieceofhimthat

andwhen hegoesdown toPanoi andtheghostsaskhim
what hasbecome ofthat bitofhim,hewill tellthem that
some onehaskeptitfromhimbecause hehaddonehim

Theghostofavasisgona,awoman whohasdied inchildbed,
cannot gotoPanoi ifherchild lives, forshecannot leave her
child. Theytherefore deceive herghostbymaking uploosely
apieceofabanana trunk inleaves, andlayingitonherbosom
when she isburied. Then, asshedeparts,shethinks shehas
thechildwith her;asshegoesthebanana stalkslipsabout
intheleaves andshethinks thechild ismoving;andthis in
herbewildered new condition contents her,tillshegetsto
Panoi andfinds that shehasbeen deceived. Inthemean-
while thechild hasbeentaken toanother house, because they
know thatthemother willcome back totake itssoul. She
seeks everywhereforthechild ingriefandragewithout
ceasing ;andtheghostofavasisgona therefore isparticularly
dreaded.

somesay,there aretwoPanois, onebelow theother, andthe
dead diefrom theuppertothelower, asliving men diefrom
earth; from thelower they never die,butturn intowhite
ants' nests,tewogqatetenia.
Descents toPanoi have beenbynomeans uncommon.
There wasawoman, whodiednotmany years ago,whoonce
much desired toseeherlatelydead brother; sheperfumed
herself withwater inwhich adead rathadbeensteeped,to
giveherself adeath-like smell, pulled upabird's-nest fern,a
puget, anddescended bythehole shehadopened. Shehad
nodifficultyinfinding Panoi, andshesawfriends therewho
weresurprisedtoseeher,andnever discovered that shewas
alive. Shefound herbrotherlyinginahouse, because asa
recent ghosthewasnotstrong enough yettomove about.
Hecautioned hertoeatnothing there, andshereturned.
This descent wasinthebody,aswasthat ofoneMolborbor
ofValuwa, whowentdown andsawhiswife;butaman in
Motlav, more lately dead, used togodown insleep,hissoul
descending, andhisbodyremainingasinatrance. Hecould
dothisatwill,andreceived moneyfordoing it,professingto
visit therecently dead, aboutwhom their friends were un-
happy, andeven tobeabletobring them back. Henever
didinfactbring anyback;hesaidhehadseen thepersons
andtalked withthem, butwaspreventedfrom bringing them
back. He, too,preparedforhissoul's descent bywashinghis
bodywithwater inwhich aputrid rat,snake orlizard had
been steeped.There wasaman informer daysatMotlav,
Vanvanvegirgir byname,whogoingdown toPanoi inhis
falegi, soul, took once another manwithhim inhisbody.

Panoi;theghostsdetected theliving man,and cried out,
'Thesmell ofthatworld !'Thetwodeclared thattheywere
really dead, and totrythem theghosts broughtoutdead
men's bones, toseeiftheywould rattle them asghosts do,

allowed togoon.Vanvanvegirgir went forward tofindthe
man's wife,andbroughthertohim;theytalkedtogether,
andthemanbeggedhertogoback totheworld with him.
That she saidwasimpossible,and shegavehim ashell
armlet bywhich toremember her.Hetook herbythe
hand andbegantodragher;herhandcame off,andher
bodycame topieces. For, asthestoryisexplained, ghosts
inPanoi have something more ofbodyandsubstance than
theyhavewhentheycome back intotheworld;elsethe
man could nothave taken hold ofhisdead wife's hand.
When aghost comes intotheworld,itisbutataqangm that

died,andsheherself wasveryillandappearedtodie. She
recovered, however, andtoldthepeoplethat shehadfollowed
herhusband tothe hillGarat, andhadseenhimtherebound

wasdone because hehadnotpaidhisdebts;'Goback,' they
bade her, 'totheGauapeople, andsaytothem, Payyour

TheOriginofDeath wasascribed atLepers' Island, both to
thedisuse ofthepowerofchangingtheskin,andtothedefect
ofnature which hadnotgiven menthatpower. Onceupon
atime awoman andacrabdisputedthepoint,thewoman
maintainingthatthecrabwasbetter than men,changingits
shell, becoming young again, andliving long. Shewanted
thecrab tochangebodies with her;andsheblamed Tagar
because hedidnotmakemenrightly. But inaccordance
with thestorywhich istoldinvaryingforms intheSolomon
Islands, theBanks'group, andtheNew Hebrides, menhad
informer times thepowerofchangingtheir skin. There was
anoldwoman whohadtwograndchildren. These twoboys
were onedayplayingatblocking back thewater ofalittle
brook, when thestream brought down aTahitian chestnut. One
oftheboystook it,andgaveittohisgrandmothertoroast.
Afterwards theotherboy,whohadatfirstdespisedthechestnut,
ranhome unobserved andate it,sothatwhen thefirstboywent
foritthechestnut wasgone. Theboyscolded hisgrandmother
forneglect, and she,angryinherturn, saidtotheboys,'You
twodon't wish toliveforever,butwould rather thatweshould
not live.' Shehadjustcome backfromchangingherskin in
thewater higher upinthestream which theboyswereblocking


284 Death. Burial. After Death.[CH.
back;andtheyhadseenthecast-off skin, pickeditupwith a
stick, andthrown itoutofthewater. Theoldwoman inher
angerfollowed thestream down totheplace where herskin
waslying onthebank, andputitonagain. Since that
timemankind haslostthepowerofchanging skins, and all
have died.
Atdeath the soul, tamtegi, departs from thebody. When
itiscertain that itisgonethewailingfordeathbegins.
At first thetamtegi doesnotgofaraway, andthere are
sounds which shew itspresence;they never drive itaway,
itisonlythesoul ofonewhohasbeen eaten that isdriven
offwith theblowingofconchs;when thetimecomes itgoes,
andthetime isahundreddays. Thecorpseisburied
