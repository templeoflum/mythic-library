STORIES.
THEnative Stories orFolk-tales which follow areallofthem,
with theexceptionofthefirst, translated fromthemanuscripts
written formebynatives ofthevarious islands inwhich the
stories aretold. The firstexample waswritten downbythe
Rev.A.PennyatFlorida, inthenativelanguageasheheard
thestorytold. The translation isasaccurate and literal in
each caseasIcouldmake it;thedetailedprolixityofanative
narrative isverycharacteristic;and itispossible that,with
thevarying qualityofthestory- tellingoftheindividual
writers, theremay appear somethingalso ofthe different
narrativestyleoftheeastern andwesterngroupsofthese
islands ofMelanesia. The value oftrulynative stories is
beyondallquestion ;theyexhibit native lifeintheparticular
details which come inthecourse ofthenarrative, theyarefull
oftheconceptions which thenativepeopleentertain about the
world around them, theyshow thenative mind active infancy
andimagination,andtheyform arich store ofsubjectsfor
comparison with thefolk-tales ofotherpartsoftheworld.
Tothequestion how farthosewho tellandthosewhohear
these stories believe them tobetrue itishard togivean
answer. Tosome extenttheyarebelieved, andtoagreat
extenttheyaretreated asflightsoffancy.Astory-teller

andwould have little effect ifnotbroughtforth astrue;
astory,because ithasalways been toldandheard, isnotopen
tomuch doubt orcriticism. But itmaybesafelysaidthat to
thenatives astoryisnotapieceofhistory;themarvels are
notvery seriously taken, however much theyareenjoyed;
anything4seemspossibleofcourse when magicisatworkand
whenspiritsaretheagents;that there aresuchspiritsas
Qat, forexample,isnotdoubted, andthestory goesthathe
performedcertain feats. Icannot, however, think that the
nativesseriouslybelieve that birds and fish talk;Ihave
never discovered fromthem thattheydonotdistinguish
between animate andinanimatethings, between birds and
beasts andmen.When anowlinastorytalksandcooks food,
both actions areonalevel, notofsupposedfactbutoffancy.
Thenative mind isfulloflively intelligence, and isbyno

itmoves inaccordance withgenerally acceptedbeliefs. There
isinFlorida andinMota atitle forastorytotell,tugu ni

These stories areheredivided intothree classes :I.Animal

Samuku lived inhisvillage, andbuilt hishouse, andworked,
andgoodandmanywere hisaffairs;sohetook awifeand
married, andtheytwo lived well,andagreed perfectlywell
together, and worked, andmuch was their food. And
Samuku camehome andasked forfood, because hewas

muku wasangry with hiswife, and scolded hergreatly.
And hiswife saidtohim, Iamtired ofmakingfood foryou,

3.THEMIM. TORRES ISLANDS.
They say*that theMinipeople draggedtheyamsfrom
placetoplace, having brought them ashore atHiw, and
then dragged them toTugua,forwhich reason theyams
atHiwand atTuguaarevery large andlong. Butwhen
they dragged themalonghere toLo, allthepeople were
down onthe reefsfishingandheardnothingofit;nor


368 Siones.[CH.
didtheyknowanything-tilltheyfound therind ofthe
yams sticking-tothe roots ofthe treesalong1thepath.
These they picked upandplanted; andonthat account
theLoyamsarenotvery large,butplentiful enough.
Because theMinipeoplesliced theiryamsinhalf forthe
men ofHiwandofTugua,andthenpassed ontoToga,
and slicedagainforthem there, onwhich account theyams
there arevery large andlong.Afterwardstheycrossed to
Ureparapara, where thepeoplesliced theyams inhalfand
planted them. Theydidthesame inalltheislands that
way;itwasonlyatLothatthepeopledidnotseeandhear
whatwasgoingon.Thecrowns oftheyams remained and
wereplanted somewhere. TheMinipeople went dragging
theyams throughalltheislands, shouting andcallingtothe
men ofevery placetocomeand slicetheyams, andtake their
burden fromthem.
4.THEORIGIN OFPOISONED ARROWS. AURORA ISLAND.
Ihave often heardthemtellingthestoryabout itinthisway.
They saythat inoldtimes therewasnofighting. Butthere
wasanoldmanwhose name wasMuesarava, whowasblind
andused tostaydoing nothinginthehouse;andheheard a
pigeon calling, andtook abowandbroad-headed arrow and
went under thetree;andthepigeonletdropabitofthe
fruit itwaseating, andthatblindman shot ataventure into
thetree,andhitthepigeonwithoutseeingit.Andhetook it
up,andwent andputitintotheoventogether with the
yams, andsatdown andsangasong. Buttwoyoungfellows
came along andquietly openedthat oldman Muesarava's
oven, and ateuphispigeonwith some ofhisyams. Then
theywent toanotherplace, andsangback asongtohim;
andheheardit,andwent back toeathispigeon,butfound
when heuncovered theoven that itwaseatenup,andthat
somethingnotgood hadbeen putinitsplace. Then he
wasexceeding angry,andplottedafight againstthepeople
oftheplacewhence thetwoyoung menhadcomewhohad


xix.] Origin ofPoisoned Arrows. 369
stolen and eaten Muesarava's food. AndnowMuesarava
begantomakefighting-arrows ofmen's bones. Muesarava
wentandgrabbed upwith hishands aboywhohaddied,and
took hisbones, andbeatthem tosplinters andrubbed them
sharp. But hisenemies ontheir sideknewnothingofthat,
they onlycutwood intoshape,orbones offishorbirds, and
fixedthem intheir arrows, while Muesarava onhisside
prepared men's bones. Andwhen theyfought theyshot at
himand hit,buthedidnotdie;andheshotthem andthey
could notlive, but diedoutrightallofthem. Andthey
fought again andshot athim,and hithimandhedidnot
die;butMuesarava shot atthem and hit,andtheyalldied.
Soitoftenhappened, andtheysawthattheydied invery
great numbers;andtheyasked Muesarava whyitwasthat
theyshothimandhedidnot die,while heshotthem and
theyallofthem died. Therefore hetoldthem and said,
'Goandgrubuponeofthedeadmen Ihave shot,andscrape
hisbones, andpoint your arrows with that.' Uponthisthey
listened tohiscounsel anddidashehad said tothem;and
whentheyfought again theyshothim,andhestraightway
died.
And thatthing,thedead man's bone thatMuesarava
groundtoapointforhimself with hisown hand,still
remains, andhasnotyetbeenspoilt ;thereed-shaft hasbeen
spoilt andreplacedoverandoveragain, butthatdead man's
bone stillremains;Ihave seen itmyselfinmybrother's
possession ;itstillremains. Thepeoplethink agreatdealof
it,thinkingthat there issupernatural power, mana, inthat
totoarrow. Ifthere isheard arumour offighting, andthat
ispointedinthedirection whence itcomes, thefighting
comes tonothing.
