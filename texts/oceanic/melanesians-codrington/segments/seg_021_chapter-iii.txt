SOCIAL REGULATIONS. CHIEFS.
IThasbeenshewn that thesocial structure inthese Mela-
nesian islands isnot tribal, and itwillhave been observed
therefore thatthere canbenopoliticalstructure heldtogether
bythepoweroftribal chiefs;butchiefs exist, and stillhave
inmost islands important place andpower, thoughnever
perhapssomuchimportanceinthenative view as
.theyhave
intheeyesofEuropean visitors, whocarrywiththem the
persuasionthatsavage peoplearealwaysruledbychiefs.A
trader orother visitor looks forachief, andfinds such aone
asheexpects;avery insignificant personinthiswaycomes
tobecalled, andtocallhimself, thekingofhisisland, and
hisconsideration amonghisown peopleisofcourse enor-
mously enhanced bywhat whitepeople make ofhim. The
practice moreover ofthecommanders ofshipsofwarbywhich
local chiefs areheldresponsiblefortheconduct oftheirpeople,
andaretreated asiftheyhadconsiderablepower, undoubtedly
increases theirimportance, norcanthat result beregretted.
Asamatter offactthepowerofchiefs hashitherto rested
uponthebelief intheirsupernatural power derived fromthe
spiritsorghosts withwhich theyhad intercourse. Asthis
belief hasfailed, intheBanks' Islands forexample some time
ago,thepositionofachief hastended tobecome obscure;and
asthisbelief isnowbeing generally undermined anewkind

with Pauulo Oou;andlower down asecondseparation was
made, sothat intheendthree settlements were formed of
people whocounted themselves ofkin. Theinhabitants of
what isnowSaaanimenu received triefugitives with Pauulo

been thehereditarychiefs1

inthebelief that theyhave communication withpowerful

Aman'sposition beinginthiswayobtained, hisowncharacter

opinion supported him inhisclaim forageneral obedience,
besides thedreaduniversallyfeltofthetindalo powerbehind

authoritytoimposeitwasrecognized, andbecause itwas
firmly believed thathecouldbring calamityandsickness upon

offender had tohireanadvocate tostate hiscasediscreetly,

that achief ofsense, energy andgood feeling,will usehis
power onthewhole tothegreat advantageofthepeople;but
abaduseofachiefs powerisnaturally common, inoppression,
seizinglandandproperty, increasinghisstock ofheads, and
gainingaterriblereputation.Forexample,amanwhohad
aprivate enemy wouldgivemoneytoachief tohavehim
killed, asonedidnotlongagotoDikea;Dikea would send
oneofhisyoung men tokillhim. Butsometimes theman
would know hisdanger andsendmoremoneytothechief to
save his life. Dikea would take both sums anddoashe

Thepowerofachiefnaturally diminished inoldage,from
inactivity, parsimony,andlossofreputation ;and,tothecredit
ofthepeople,alsoif,likeTakua when hetookthedaughterof

Thevery great partplayedinthenative lifeoftheBanks'

IntheNorthern New Hebrides thepositionofachief is

thesonperhaps beingtooyoung,achiefs brother will
succeed him;sometimes aman will sethimself upwhen no
successor isacknowledged,orthepeoplewillchoose some one
tolead them. Someyears ago Mairuru, the chief of
Walurigi,wasavery greatman;hesent hisson,ayoung
boy,tobeeducated atNorfolk Island, and itwas atonce
understood that aChristian education which shut outbelief

Ifthissonhadsettled inhisfather'svillagebefore theold
man's death, hewould nodoubt have succeeded tosome ofhis

When Mairuru diedwithout anapparent successor, acertain
man attemptedtotake hisplace ;hewent into the late
chief's sacred haunt, histauten, inwhich heused tohave his
intercourse with thewui, spirits, andhedeclared thathe
heard some onewhistle tohim there. Hetoldthepeople
alsothat afterwards inthenight hefeltsomething come
