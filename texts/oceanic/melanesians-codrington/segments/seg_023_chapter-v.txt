CHAPTER V.
SECKET SOCIETIES ANDMYSTERIES.
THERE iscertainly nothing- more characteristic ofMelane-
sian lifethan thepresenceofSocieties which celebrate
Mysteries strictlyconcealed from theuninitiated andfrom all
females. Adress, with. amask orhat,disguisesthemembers
ifthey appearinopen day; theyhave strangecriesand
soundsbywhich theymake theirpresence known when
theyareunseen.'Insome cases, asinFlorida andAurora,
theymake apublic show ofapieceofthehandiwork ofthe
ghosts withwhom itispretendedthattheyhave been as-
sociating. Such societies aretheDukduk ofNew Britain
describedbyMr.Brown andMr.Komilly,theMatambala of
Florida, theTamate oftheBanks' Islands, theQatu ofthe
Northern New Hebrides. Aphotograph fromNew Caledonia
shews afigure which canhardlybedistinguished'from that
ofatamate from theBanks' Islands, andMr.Romillymentions
aninstitution liketheDukduk inNew Guinea. Itisplain,
therefore, that this institution extends very widely through
Melanesia, andtheNangaofFiji,thoughinsomerespects
different, cannot bethoughttobeentirelydistinct from it;
yetitisremarkable thatnothingofthesorthasasyetbeen
found inSanta Cruz, orintheSolomon Islands east of
Florida1

closely connected with theSolomon islanders. When itisremembered thatthe


Secret Societies andMysteries. [CH.
TheFlorida mysterieswere believed tohavebeen brought
from Ysabel, where nothingofthekind has asyetbeen
observed. This belief, how-
ever, serves topointtoa
connexion with theDukduk
ofNew Britain, inthename
ofwhich afurther connexion
mayprobablybefound. In
allthese societies theghosts
ofthedead were supposed
tobepresent;intheBanks'
Islands theirname is'The
Ghosts;'inSanta Cruz a
ghostisduka\ inFlorida
onemethod ofconsulting
theghostsofthedead is
paluduka.Itisvery likely
therefore that inNew
Britain theDukduk arealso
'The Ghosts.'
P~Oneveryimportant point
ofdifference separatesthese
from thebora ofAustralia,
inwhich thegrown youth
ofthetribe are'made young men,' andhave impartedto
them some knowledgeofthereligiousbeliefs andpractices
ofthe elders. Grown menand infants, married andun-
married, areequally admitted tothe societies ofFlorida
and theNew Hebrides;and ifintheBanks' Islands it
isnotcustomarytoadmitboys very young,there iscer-
tainly nolimit ofageasregardsadmission. Itisno
doubt thecasethatwhere these societies flourish, ayouth

probablynowife. Such ayoung man hasnotbeen able to
meet theexpenseofinitiation orofmatrimony ;hisfriends,
from carelessness orpoverty,have lethimgrow upwithout
making proper provisionforhim;heremains uninitiated and
unmarried from thesame cause;butinitiation isbynomeans
apreliminary steptomatrimony.Itisdifficult, inview of
the strictsecrecy andsolemnityofthemysteries, tobelieve
thatthere isnoknowledge impartedininitiation ofareligious
character. Theouter world ofwomen andchildren, andthe
uninitiated, matawonowono, whoseeyeswere closed, undoubt-
edlybelieved that theinitiated entered into association with
theghostsofthedead;thestranglecriesand awi'ul sounds
thatproceeded from thesacred andunapproachable lodgeof
theassociation, orfrom theforest when themembers ofit
were abroad, weremorethanhuman intheir ears;thefigures
thatappeared werenotthose ofmen.Anaccident would no
doubt sometimes make itplainthat itwasaman,some one
wellknown andrecognized, whowasfiguringasaghost ;
butthen hisdisguise wasnotthework ofmortal hands;and
theshrewdconjecturethat alltherestwere asmuchmenand
neighboursastheonewhose fallrevealed himmight be
entertained, butwould bedangeroustoexpress.Itwasonly
when theneophyte wasadmitted intothemysterious pre-
cincts thathefound onlyhisdaily companions there, and
learnt that there wasnothingtobeimpartedtohimexcept
theknowledge how thesounds wereproduced, how the
dresses anddecorations weremade, andinsome cases asong
anddance. There wasnosecret article ofbeliefmadeknown,
andnosecret form ofworship practised. Theordinaryforms
ofprayerand sacrifice were performedaselsewhere, though
here inconnexion with thesemysteries.There werenoforms
ofworship peculiartothesociety, andnoobjectsofworship
ofakindunknown tothose without.
Itisremarkable also that, asfarasIhave been able to
ascertain, there isnothingorverylittle that isobscene, or
moreobjectionable from amoralpointofviewthan imposture

Insome placestheneophyteshadtoendurehardshipsoreven

Florida theinterval isconsiderable;butscholars from Florida,
ontheirwaytoNorfolk Island many years ago,recognized
theirown matabala inthesalagoro ofMota, towhich as
strangers they werefreelyadmitted. The result oftheir
admission was fatal tothemysteryineither institution. A
Floridaboywhohadseenwhat theMota salagoro wasand
contained, knewverywellwhat sortofmysteriesthose were at
home intowhich hehadnotyetbeen initiated, andheceased

tobelieve intheirsupernaturalcharacter. The uninitiated
boysfrom theBanks' Islands heard inNorfolk Island from
their Florida schoolfellows what theyhad seen, andthe
sacredness ofthesalagoro was lost forthem. The secret was
outmany years ago,thoughinFlorida thepowerofthe
mysterieswasmaintained tillChristianity prevailedinthe
only partoftheisland inwhich theinstitution hadaseat.
IntheBanks' Islands thetamate hassurvived theintroduction
ofChristianity.Allbelief inthesupernaturalcharacter of
theassociations haslong disappeared,allwomen andchildren
know thatthetamate aremen dressed indisguises made by
themselves, andthat thesounds and cries arenaturally

.Intruth, the social powerofthese

inanarbitrary manner with the institutions ofthepeople, buttoleave
ittotheirown sense ofright andwrong, and theirownknowledge of
thecharacter ofwhat they did,tocondemn ortotolerate what their growing
enlightenment would callintoquestion. Sothere aroseamonghisearly pupils
thedoubt whether itwould berightforthem asChristians tocontinue members
ofthetamate societies, toseek foradmission intothem, andfrequent their
lodges. Thebishop putittothem thattheyshouldenquire andconsult among
themselves about therealcharacter ofthesocieties;didtheyofferworship and

thattheycould notdiscover anything wronginitself, except thepretence of
association withghosts, which hadalready ceased tobeserious, andthebeating
androbbingoftheuninitiated, which itwasquite possibleforthem torefuse
totakepartinand tooppose. Thebishoptherefore would notcondemn the

with theteachingofBishop Patteson, andwith theauthority
ofthegreatman oftheisland, thesocietyoftheGreat Tamate
hadforbidden theuseofthebowandarrow inprivate quarrels

I.The Sanies' Islands. TheBanks' Islands, with the

thosewhohadpartakenofthesecret became numerous enough
theytook itoutofthewoman's hands, made alodgefor

the first tamateassociation, with the strictest exclusion of
allwomen ever afterwards. From thisstorynothingcanbe

II.TheNew Hebrides. IntheNorthern New Hebrides the
Qatu, with other institutions ofthesame kind, has itsplace
inMaewo, Omba, andAraga. InOmba, Lepers' Island, Iknow
nomorethan that there isaQatu, thehats forwhich aremade
intheshape ofashark;from theothertwoislands information
isabundant. InMaewo, Aurora, there ismorethanoneQatu,
butone,theQatu lata, isthe chief. Inallthese there is
initiation with trial ofendurance bytorments andhardships,
butthere isnosecret imparted beyond theknowledgeofthe
songanddance andthemakingofthedecorations. Forthe

theyremain unwashed andwithverylittle foodandwater
tilltheappointed time hasexpired, which maybethirty
days. During-thistime theylearn adance, andsongs, but
theydonot, asintheBanks' Islands, follow asongasthey
dance. Little boysarenot initiated, becausetheycould not
endure thehardships andtortures tobegonethrough ;but
theycanenter byproxy;amanalreadyinitiated willgo
throughaformal initiation forthem. There isnolimit of
age,noperiodoflifetowhich initiation ismoreappropriate

Anaccount ofhisinitiation intothechief Qatu, that called
QatutaGobio, waswritten formebyanative youthwhile his
memory was fresh onthesubject. Hewasprobablysixteen
yearsoldwhen withtwoothers hepassed through what he
thus relates.
'Father, letme tellyouhow Iwent intotheQatu.Idid

himandsaid,Allright!IfIshould die, allright!After
that Iwentwhere therewasabuilding,agamal, putupfor

Not satisfied with thisexperience,thesame youth was

Headds that thebark ofthevaru,anhibiscus,isbeaten
outwhite forthedecoration ofthis Qatu, and that the

Inthe island ofAraga,Pentecost orWhitsuntide, im-

III.Solomon Islands. From theNew Hebrides toFlorida
intheSolomon Islands isalong step,butintheMatambala
appears very plainlyanother form oftheQatu. The seat of
itisadistrict ofFlorida calledBelaga, where alone therites
were celebrated, menfrom theother districts coming tobe
initiated there. Theoriginoftheinstitution isascribed to
oneSiko,whocame fromBugotuinYsabel. Tohim sacrifices
weremade intheir assemblies byasuccession ofmenwhohad
received the office tilltheyear 1883,when thelastembraced
Christianity, andtheMatambala came toanend. Themys-
teries were celebrated atirregularintervals ofsixortenyears,
buttheinitiated formed apermanent body,andacertainpart
ofthebeach atBelaga with theforest behind itwasalways
tambu, sothatnouninitiatedperson mightenter theprecincts,
andnowomanmight passalongthebeach. Within this
sacredregionthere were twelve vunut/iasanctuaries, and in
eachoneasacred vovoko house wasbuilt;butthetwovunutha
atMaterago andatVolotha were farmore important than the
rest,andthehouses built there sosacred thatnomanentered
them norevenapproached them;there wereimagesinthem
ofbirdsand fish, crocodiles andsharks, thesunandmoon, and
men. Thebuildingofthese twohouses wasthebeginning
ofthechiefpart oftheproceedings. Inallthattheydid
theysupposed themselves tobefollowingthecourse ofSiko's
actions.

initiated from eachvillagetakewiththem their friends who
aretobeadmitted, butdonotyetletthem enter thewnutta,
thesanctuaryinthebush,where theythemselves areoccupied
inmakingthestructures ofbamboo which arecalled the
tindalo, theghosts.These were ofseveral forms. One called
theVoiwasdescribed totheBishopasascreen some tenfeet
longbyninehigh,made ofbarkpainted andornamented, and
carried outbyseveral menbehind itintotheopen, where it
could beseenbythewomen, children, and uninitiated, who
firmlybelieved ittobenotsomuch thehandiwork ofghosts
asanappearanceoftheghoststhemselves. Another, the
Koitaba-vunutha, was solargethateightyorahundred men
inside itcarried itdown tothebeach, where theoutside
population gazedatit.There wasanother instrument, the
Kuku, awooden clubwith abird's head. Oneofthefirstpro-
ceedingsoftheMatambala men after thepaths wereswept,
andthecountry wasmade close,wastocutdown tallbamboos
forthese structures, tiethem inbundles, andlaythem inthe
suntodry.'After awhile theybroughtthesedown tothe
vunutha, andaddedlengthtolengthtilltheywereextremely
long ;andthentheytook vines andsago spathes andfastened
them tothebamboos which theyhadprepared; andthen
theytook coleus andturmeric;thecoleus theychewed forthe

theypainted with thesethingsthesago spathesthattheyhad
fastened ontothebamboos, variegated anddazzling, very
fearful forustobehold.' The tindalofigures,ofwhichthirty
orforty weremade inoneplace, must have resembled the
Qatumasks orhats oftheBanks' Islands, though theywere
verymuchhigher ;forlikethemtheywere conical inshape,
andweremoved bymen inside them. 'Andwhen allwas
finishedthey appointedtheirdayforthespectacle ;and all
thewomen andboyscame outintheevening andviewed the

down thetindaloimagestothebeach;and allthewomen and
theboysthoughtthattheywere nothingbutghosts, because
theydidnotknowhowtheywere made. After thatthey
appointed again thedayafter themorrow fortheshow, and
when thatdaycame thewomenagain came outintotheopen
forthespectacle. Andwhen theshowmade inthatway
was over, themen took thetindaloimages back into the
vunutka, andburnt upwith fire allthoseimages. When that
was done, allthemencame back totheirvillages from
thevunutha. And itwasnotpossibletomake known -to
women andboysthingsofthiskind;butatlength, when this
Gospelreached us,then itcame out,sothat allthewomen
andtheboysandtheuninitiated understood allaboutthings
ofthis kind.'
Theuninitiated were calledtelegai, theneophytesthenew

therewasnoknowledge communicated,exceptofthefactthat
whatever wasdonewasthework ofmenandnotofghosts,
which wasnodoubt asurprisingrevelation. Still, however, we
maybesurethattheMatambala, newand old,firmlybelieved
thattheartofmakingtheimagesandthecourse ofalltheir
proceedingshadbeentaught bySiko,nowatindalo, andthat
theywereguidedandenabled bythesupernaturalassistance of
Sikoandhiscompanions, now tindalo, andbytheghostsalsoof
their eminentpredecessorsintheMatambala,allofwhom as
well asSikowereinvoked with sacrifices. Buttherewasno
esoteric doctrinetaught,noranysecret imparted beyondthatof
themakingoftheimages. Onthispointthewitness ofthe
initiated isasclear inFlorida asintheBanks' Islands andthe
New Hebrides. Acertain rite, ormark, ofinitiation there
was;thecandidateclaspedatree,andwastouched insix
places with afire-stick onshoulders, loins, and buttocks.
When thusbranded theywere toldthattheywerenow Siko's
men,orSiko's messengers.Inadmission tothese mysteries,
also, there wasnolimit ofage,andnotime oflifemore ap-
propriate than another. Grown-up menwere admitted, who
generally came from other partsoftheisland;atBelag^

infants could notcome outofthesacred precints andthe

from theirhomes three months.
Duringthewhole ofthistimetheMatambala, under cover of
the terror oftheirpretendedassociation withghosts, and
taking advantageoftheclosingofthepaths,wereplaying
