DANCES. MUSIC, GAMES.
(i)Dances. Itmaybeconfidentlyasserted that inthe
Melanesian islands here inview dances haveabsolutely no
religiousorsuperstitious character, althoughvisitors find
'devil dances'and*devil grounds'
enough. Menandwomen
always danceapart ;thesongswhich accompanythedances
areundoubtedly some ofthem indecent, and Iwould byno
means denythat there areindecent dances, thoughInever
heard ofthem. There mightbethoughttobeasuperstitious
character inthose dances inwhich theperformersaresup-
posedfcobe'
ghosts,'ifitwerenotthatghosts were believed
toamuse themselves withdancingaswell asmen;itmight
bethoug*htthatwhen themembers oftamateghostclubs

least reason tobelieve thattheemblems oftheclubshadany
character ofthe sort.AnAmbrym drum setupwhen a

maybesaidthat dances areperformedbefore theimagesof
ancestors, andthedeceased maybecalled either'god'or

women, twoandtwo,with thearms ofeachovertheother's

Ihave seen isoneinwhich inSan Cristoval andSaaper-
formers wavedancingclubs asthey represent fighting scenes,
with theaccompanimentofaverysoftandtunefulsong. The
general term formen'sdancinginFlorida isgavai\ inthe
iilarutheysitasifpaddling;inthehauhamumu there isa
concert ofmany bamboopipes blown incertain tunes,
without asong;this isaperformancelearnt bymenfrom
ghosts, andbrought over from Laudari inGuadalcanar.
Parties ofmenpractisethese dances tilltheyareperfect,
andthen start onavoyageabout theneighbouring islands,
going a-dancing, gavai tona, exhibitingtheirperformance
everywhere,andreceiving hospitality andhandsomepresents
whereverthey go.After thereturn ofsuchaparty theywill

(2)Songs. Words fitted tomusic arethesongs andpoetry
ofthepeople;thecharacter ofthetunesdiffering more in
thevarious groups andislands than thegeneralcharacter of
thewords. There isnoconceptionofpoetry without a
tune, thoughtunes without words arenotunknown. In
songscertain words orforms ofexpression,which arenot
used incommonspeech,areeverywhere thought poetical and
appropriate, andwords arelengthenedorshortened tofit
whatmust becalled themetre. IntheBanks' Islands the
useofadistinctsong-dialectisvery remarkable, inwhich not
onlyarewords used which arenever used inspeech, some
probablyarchaic andsome borrowed from aneighbouring
island, andnotonlyarewords contracted orprolongedtosuit
thetune, butineach island thesong-languageissodifferent
from that ofordinary speechthat thetwohave theappear-
ance oftwodialects, ascompletelyasintheDialogue and
Chorus ofaGreekplay. Thedifference isleastconspicuous
inGaua, Santa Maria, mostconspicuous probablyinMota.
OnonesideofMotasongsarecomposedinsomethinglike
thelanguageofGaua, ontheother insomethinglikethatof
Motlav; yetthelanguageofnoMotasongisthespoken
languageofGaua orMotlav, nor isaMotasong quiteinthe
song-dialectofGaua orMotlav. EveryoneoftheBanks'
Islands hasatleast oneform ofspeechforsongs andanother
forcommon use,while some, likeMota, arenotcontent with
two. InSanta Maria, however, while thespoken language
ofLakona isverydifferent from that ofGaua, thesongsare
almost ifnotquitethesame.Apoetorpoetess more orless

(3)Musical Instruments. Thedrum, inmany forms,maybe
said tobethe characteristic instrument ofMelanesia, yet
there seems tobenouseofsuch athinginFlorida, and
perhaps noknowledgeofanative drum inSanta Cruz. The
common form ofdrum isrepresented byajointofbamboo
withanopen longitudinalslit;thismaybeseen invarious
sizes from thelargesttosmall bamboos, and isfollowed in
theform ofthedrums which aremade oflogsoftrees. In
these thetrunk ofatreeofasuitable kindand size ishollowed
from alongandnarrow openingattheside,thelipofwhich,
cutthin, receives thebeat ofthedrum -sticks. These drums
arevery resonant andwell toned, andcanbeheard ata
greatdistance. The skill ofthedrummers andthepieces
theyperformarenotcontemptible, when two oreven three
performerssitdown toonedrum andplaysomepieceof
native drum-music intheBanks' Islands, orwhen three
drums ofdifferent sizeandtone, asIhave heard atSaa,are
played togetherwithsurprising precision andvariety. At

bamboo, pipesoftheBanks' Islands, wecjore, produceaplaintive
little music. Thecorresponding nggore ofLepers'Island is
longer, some three feet,andhasfour holes, sothat native
songscanbeplayed. Thewarn, double flute, ofthesame
island consists oftwolengthsofslender bamboo with the
knotbetween them;oneither sideoftheknotontheupper
side isahole,andatboth endstwoholes above andbelow.
When theinstrument isplayedtheknot with itstwo holes
goesinto theperformer's mouth, hisoutstretched hands
supportthebamboo, andhemodulates thesound with his
fingers andthumbs ontheholes attheends. Thebamboo
used isnotmore than two-thirds ofaninch indiameter, for
astrong sound isnotliked;themusic ofthewaru is'excellent
tohear'innative ears. IntheSolomon Islands thebamboo
jew's-harp,theneneofFlorida, iscommon, which isunknown
intheEastern Islands. Astringed instrument isknown in
theSolomon Islands, thekalove ofFlorida. Itismade ofa
pieceofbent reed orbamboo afootlongandofhalfaninch
diameter. From endtoendofthistwostringsarestretched,
passingover littlebridges which arepushed uptowards the
end totighten them;thestringsaretuned toone note.
Theperformerholds thecurved back oftheinstrument inhis
mouth, and strikes thestrings with alittle plectrumofreed
held inhisright hand;with thefingersofhislefthand he
holds thekalove sothat hekeeps oneofthestrings per-
manently stopped, andtoproduce highernotes canstopthe

isnotveryaudible toanyonebuttheperformer,towhom it
gives great delight. Amongmusical instruments must be
included thecastanets, ofshells ofnutsandseeds, wornupon
