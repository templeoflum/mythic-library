Poisoned arrows, astheyarecalled1
,areused intheSolomon
Islands, Santa Cruz, theBanks' Islands, andNew Hebrides.
IntheTorres Islands andLepers'Island arrows areused for
fighting which arenotpoisoned, yetbelong entirelytothe
same class with those that are,beingasmuch valued,
trusted andfeared astheothers;averyinstructive fact :in
Lepers'Island both kinds areused. There isagreatdiffer-

thejoiningsarefirmly bound with finestringor fibre.
Santa Cruz arrows areuniformly nearlyfour feetlong,
andweighabout twoounces;Banks' Island arrows are
about three feetnine incheslong, andweigh about an
ounce;Torres Island arrows areonlytwo feetteninches
long,weighing three-quartersofanounce. Thebonepoint
ofaSanta Cruz arrow isseven incheslong, andthefore-
shaft ofhardwood, curiouslycarved and coloured,issixteen
incheslong. Thebone head ofaTorres Island arrow is

largeandpowerful bow;theother isslightandweak, little
morethan ahuman hone fitted forthebow; one ispoisoned,
theother isnot;both areinnative estimationequally deadly.
Some oftheNew Hebrides andSolomon Island arrows have a
verysmallpointofbone. Itisthehuman bone first ofall
thatinnativeopinion givesthearrow itsefficacy; thebone
ofanydeadman willdo,because anyghost hasmana towork

These charms areknown buttoafewwhose business itis

natives answered'deadman'toearlytraders'enquiries.
The native meant that thedeadly qualitiesoftheweapon

InMota theword siqpa wasappliedatonce toEuropean

foodand other necessaries, andthegeneral apparatusof
native life. Besides these there areproductsofindustry
which aremade forthesingle purposeofexchange, and
whichmaybecalled Mat-money, Feather-money,andShell-
money. TheMat-moneyisinuseintheNorthern New
Hebrides, Aurora, Pentecost andLepers'Island. Themats
arelong andnarrow, made fornootherpurpose than to
represent value, andareinAurora andLepers'Island valued
themore, themore ancient andblack theyare.Women
plaitthem;either those ofthefamily,orwomen hired for
thepurpose. InAurora thename ismalo^ thename of
thedress which isworn bysomemen there, asbyallat
Lepers'Island. Themats arekeptinlittle housesspecially
built forthem, inwhich afire iskept always burningto
blacken them;when theyhangwith soottheyareparticularly
valued. Their value, however,isestimated bythenumber of
folds, which arecounted intens;amat oftwentyfolds is
called double, oneofthirtyfolds treble. Thoughthese mats

aremostlyused forbuyingthestepsintheSuqeClub.
