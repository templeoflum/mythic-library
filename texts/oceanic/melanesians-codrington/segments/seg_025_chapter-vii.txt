EELIGION.
THEreligionoftheMelanesians istheexpressionoftheir
conceptionofthesupernatural,andembraces averywiderange
ofbeliefs andpractices,thelimits ofwhich itwould bevery
difficult todefine. Itisequallydifficult toascertain with
precision what these beliefs are.Theideas ofthenatives are
notclearuponmany points, theyarenotaccustomed topresent
them inanysystematicformamongthemselves. Anobserver
whoshould sethimself thetaskofmaking systematic enquiries,
must findhimself baffled attheoutset bythemultiplicityof
thelanguageswithwhich hehastodeal. Suppose him to
have asamedium ofcommunication alanguage which heand
those fromwhom heseeks information canusefreelyforthe
ordinary purposesoflife,hefinds that tofailwhen heseeks
toknow what istherealmeaningofthose expressions which
hisinformant must needs useinhisowntongue,because he

valent,itwilloften happen thatheandtheenquirer donot
understand thatword inthesame sense.Amissionaryhas
hisowndifficultyinthe factthatverymuch ofhiscom-
munication iswith theyoung, whodonotthemselves know
andunderstandverymuch ofwhat their elders believe and
practice. Converts aredisposedtoblackengenerally and
indiscriminatelytheirownformer state, andwithgreaterzeal

songs and dances, who,whenquestions begintoclear his
mind, acknowledgesthatsome dances arequite innocent,
explainsthatnone thatheknows haveanyreligious significance
whatever, saysthatmany songsalsohavenothing whatever bad

are stillheathen willspeak with reserve ofwhat stillretains
withthem asacred character, andaconsideratemissionarywill

enquiries;ifthey do,theyarelikelytomakethem toosoon,
and forthewhole oftheir after-career make whateverthey
observe fitinto theirearlyscheme ofthenativereligion.
Often missionaries, itistobefeared, somanageitthatneither

alwayswith missionaries thedifficultyoflanguage ;aman

questionsoftheEuropeanathread onwhich these willpreci-
pitate themselves, and,without anyintention todeceive,
avails himself oftheopportunitytoclear hisownmind while

oftheMelanesians;and itisdesirable thatthewriter should
disclaimpretension toaccuracyorcompleteness. Thegeneral
viewwhich ispresented must betaken with theparticular
examplesofMelanesian belief andcustoms inmatters of
religion which follow.
(i)TheMelanesian mind isentirely possessed bythebelief
inasupernatural powerorinfluence, called almostuniversally
mana1
.This iswhat works toeffect everything which is
1Professor Max Miiller, inhisHibbert Lectures of1878, didmethehonour
ofquoting thefollowing words fromaletter.'ThereligionoftheMelanesians
consists, asfarasbeliefgoes,inthepersuasionthat there isasupernatural
power aboutbelongingtotheregionoftheunseen;and, asfaraspractice goes,
intheuseofmeans ofgettingthispowerturned totheirown benefit. The
notion ofaSupreme Beingisaltogether foreign tothem, orindeed ofanybeing
occupying avery elevatedplaceintheir world. ..There isabelief inaforce
altogether distinct fromphysical power, which acts inallkinds ofwaysfor

supernatural beings, have itandcanimpartit;and itessentially belongsto

farasreligious practices go,prayersand sacrifices.'

oftheverb,manag, manalii, manangi, means toimpart mana, ortoinfluence

mana inhimself also,andcansodirect itastoeffectwhat he

which theghostorspiritexercises throughit.Thus all
conspicuoussuccess isaproofthat aman hasmana;his
influence dependsontheimpression made onthepeople's
mind thathehas it;hebecomes achiefbyvirtue ofit.
Hence aman'spower, though politicalorsocial initscha-
racter, ishismana;theword isnaturallyused inaccordance
with thenative conceptionofthecharacter ofallpower and
influence assupernatural.Ifaman hasbeen successful in
fighting,ithasnotbeen hisnaturalstrengthofarm,quickness
ofeye,orreadiness ofresource that haswon success;hehas
certainly gotthemana ofaspiritorofsome deceased warrior
toempower him,conveyedinanamulet ofastone round his
neck, oratuftofleaves inhisbelt, inatoothhung upona
fingerofhisbowhand, orintheform ofwords withwhich he
brings supernaturalassistance tohis side. Ifaman'spigs
multiply, andhisgardensareproductive,itisnotbecause he
isindustrious andlooks after hisproperty,butbecause ofthe
stones fullofmana forpigsandyamsthathepossesses. Of
course ayam naturally grows whenplanted,that iswell
known, but itwillnotbevery largeunless mana comes into
play;acanoe willnotbeswift unless mana bebroughtto
bearupon it,anetwillnotcatchmany fish,noranarrow
inflict amortal wound.
(2)TheMelanesians believe inthe'existence ofbeings
personal, intelligent,fullofmana^ with acertainbodilyform
which isvisible butnotfleshlylikethebodies ofmen. These
they think tobemore orlessactively concerned inthe
affairs ofmen,andtheyinvoke andotherwiseapproach them.
These may becalledspirits ;but itismostimportantto
distinguish betweenspirits who arebeingsofanorder
higher thanmankind, andthedisembodiedspiritsofmen,
which havebecome inthevulgarsense ofthewordghosts.

From theneglectofthis distinctiongreatconfusion and
misunderstanding--arises;and itismuch tobedesired that
missionaries atanyratewouldcarefullyobserve the dis-
tinction. Any personal objectofworship among1natives in
allpartsoftheworld istakenbytheEuropeanobserver
tobeaspiritoragod,oradevil;butamong1Melanesians
atanyrate itisverycommon toinvoke departedrelatives
andfriends, andtousereligiousrites addressed tothem.A
man therefore who isapproaching-withsome rite hisdead
father, whosespirit hebelieves tobeexisting- andpleased
with hispious action,isthoughttobeworshippingafalse
godordeceiving spirit, andvery probablyistold that the
being heworshipsdoes not exist. Theperplexednative
hears with one earthat there isnosuch thingasthat
departed spiritofamanwhich hevenerates asaghostbut
hisinstructor takes tobeagod,andwith theother thatthe
soulnever dies,andthat hisownspiritualinterests arepara-
mount andeternal. They themselves make aclear distinction
between theexisting, conscious, powerful,disembodiedspirits
ofthedead, andotherspiritual beingsthatnever have been
men atall. Itistrue that thetwo orders ofbeings get
confused innativelanguage andthought, buttheir confu-
sionbeginsatoneendandtheconfusion oftheir visitors
atanother; theythink somuch andconstantlyofghosts
thatthey speakofbeings whowere nevermen asghosts;
Europeans take thespiritsofthelatelydead forgods;less
educated Europeanscallthemroundlydevils. AllMela-
nesians, asfarasmyacquaintance withthem extends, believe
intheexistence both ofspiritsthatnever weremen,andof
ghosts which arethedisembodied souls ofmen deceased :to
preserve asfaraspossiblethis distinction, thesupernatural
beingsthatwere never inahuman bodyarehere called
\
spirits, men'sspiritsthathave leftthebodyarecalled ghosts1

Thereis,however, averyremarkable difference between the
natives oftheNew Hebrides andBanks' Islands totheeast,
andthenatives oftheSolomon Islands tothewest;the
direction ofthereligiousideasandpracticesoftheformer is
jtowardsspiritsrather thanghosts, thelatterpayverylittle
attention tospirits andaddress themselves almostwhollyto
e^.ghosts.Thisgoes with amuchgreater developmentofa
sacrificial system inthewest than intheeast;andgoes
alongalsowithacertain advance intheartsoflife.Enoughis
hardly known oftheSanta Cruzpeople, who liebetween, to
speakwithcertainty, buttheyappeartorange themselves, as
theyrather dogeographically, ontheside oftheSolomon
Islands. InFijiitistheestablished custom tocalltheobjects
oftheoldworship gods ;butMr. Fison was'inclined to
think allthespiritual beingsofFiji,includingthegods, simply
theMota tamate?i.e.ghosts ;andthewords ofMr.Hazel-
wood, quoted byMr.Brenchley (CruiseoftheCuracoa, p.181),
confirm thisview. Tuikilakila toldoneofthe firstmission-
arieshowheproposedtotreat him.'Ifyoudie first,' saidhe,
'1shallmake youmygod.'Andthesame Tuikilakila would
sometimessayofhimself,'Iamagod.'Itisadded thathe
believed ittoo;and hisbelief wassurelycorrect. For it
should beobserved thatthechief never saidhewasorshould
beagod,inEnglish, butthathewasorshould beakalou,
inFijian, andakalou henodoubt became;that istosay,on
hisdecease hisdeparted spirit wasinvoked andworshipped
asheknew itwould be.Heusednoverb*am'or'shallbe'
;
saidonly'Iakalou? InFijialso thisworshipofthedead,
rather than ofbeingsthatnever were intheflesh, accom-
panies amore considerable advance inthearts oflifethan is
foundin,forexample, theBanks' Islands. Itisplain that
thenatives ofthesouthern islands oftheNew Hebrides,
though theyare said toworship'
gods,' believe inthe
existence andpower ofspiritsother than thedisembodied
could befound must beused, since thelanguagesareatleast asmanyasthe
islands. Itisdifficult toconvey bydescription theideaswhichoughttoattach
tothenewword, butatleastnothing erroneous isconnotedbyit.

spiritsofthedead, aswell asoftheghostsofmen.When a
missionaryvisitor toAnaiteumreportedthatthepeople*lived
under themostabject bondagetotheir NatmasesJ and called
these'gods,' hewasevidently speakingoftheghosts,the
Natmat oftheBanks' Islands, fortheword isnodoubt the

appears equallyclear intheaccountgivenofthesacred stones
andplaces, whichcorrespondtothose ofthenorthern islands

inMelanesia abelief inaspirit which animates anynatural

representisthatghosts haunt theseaandthe forest, having
powertoraise storms andtostrike atraveller with disease,
orthatsupernatural beings nevermen dothesame. It
maybesaid, then, thatMelanesianreligiondivides thepeople
intotwogroups;one,where, withanaccompanyingbelief in

dead, asintheSolomon Islands;theother, where bothghosts
andspirits haveanimportant place,butthespirits havemore

ThewuloftheNorthern New Hebrides arethesame. In
theSolomon Islands itisdifficult togetanydefinition ofa
spirit exceptthat there arebeings which were never men,
andhavenotthebodilynature ofaman. InSanCristoval
such abeingiscalled Figona orHiona. SuchwasKahausi-
bware, afemale, andasnake. Thename hi'ona isknown in
Malanta also,butusedwithnoveryclearapplication;they
believe there also inurehi, notliving men, northeghostsof

lesssome socalled weremennotlong ago. Onebeing only
isasserted there tobesuperhuman,never alivewith amere
humanlife,and therefore notnow aghost;onethatnow
receives noworship, but isthesubjectofstories only, without
anyreligious consideration. This isKoevasi, afemale. How
shecame intoexistence nooneknows;shemade thingsofall

thepeopleoftheisland descend. Shewastheauthor ofdeath

Returning successful, theythrew aspearinto theroof of

CHAPTEE VIII.
SACRIFICES.
THEsimplestandmostcommon sacrificial act isthat of
throwingasmallportionoffood tothedead;this isprobably
auniversalpracticeinMelanesia. Afragmentoffoodready
tobeeaten, ofyam,aleafofmallow, abitofbetel-nut,is
thrown aside, and,wheretheydrink kava, alibation ismade
ofafewdrops,astheshare ofdeparted friends, orasa
memorial ofthem withwhich theywillbegratified.This is
done perhapswith thecallingofthename ofsome one
recentlydeceased orparticularlyinremembrance atthetime,
orelsewith ageneral regardtotheghostsofformer members
ofthecommunity.Itishardly thoughtthat thisbecomes in
factthefood ofthedeparted,butsomehow itistotheir
advantage,atanyrate itpleases them. Atthesame time

opportunityofgetting helpfromghostly power,forwhich
prayerismade. IntheNew Hebrides andBanks' Islands
thisdomestic ritehas not, sofarasmyknowledge goes,

thelatter islands have hadtheirorigininsuchofferingsto

'inthemore restricted sense, oftheSolomon Islands are
widelydifferent from those oftheNew Hebrides andBanks'
Islands;inthewestern islands theofferingsaremade to

little bitswere eatenbythosewho desired togetfighting

Such sacrifices werethought more effectual thanothers, and
advantage wastaken ofacrime, orimputed crime, totake a
lifeand offertheman tosome tindalo. Sowithin thememory
ofmen stillyoung, Dikea, thechief ofRavu, condemned one
Gisukokovilo todeath forstealing tobacco, andthegrownlads
ofHandika atebitsofhimcooked inthesacrificial fire.The
same Dikea offered ahuman sacrifice intheyear 1886. Two
calamities had fallen uponDikea. One ofhiswivesproved
false,andhesentheraway, vowingthat sheshould notreturn
tillhehad sacrificed toHauri. Also hissonhaddied,andhe
made avowthathewould killaman forhim. Some thought
thathewould killaman toburywith theboy,buthedidnot.
Heduguphisburied sonthathemightseehimoncemore;
andagain, accordingtothecommonpractice, hetookuphis'

thatDikea hadmade hisvow,andthathewould paywell for

inGuadalcanar, lameandnearly blind, andhim,theybrought

rantofthelanguage,didnotknow hisfate. Dikea, layinghis
hand onthevictim's breast, cried'Hauri !here isaman for
you,'and hisfollowers killed himwith clubs andaxes. His
headwastaken tosetupwith Dikea's collection ofskulls, his
legswere sentawaytomakeknown what hadbeen done, but
none ofhimwaseaten :'SoDikea sacrificed toHauri with
thatboy.'InBugotuofYsabel the sacrifices, havugagi,are

lesser sacrifices, there isnotcommonly presentthenotion
ofpropitiation, norperhapsofsubstitution. When, asin
thecaseofDikea, misfortune issupposedtohave followed on
some offence, the offended tindalo ispropitiated bythe

notion ofasacrifice asthesemore easternpeopleunderstand it.
Intheuseoftheword intheBanks' Islands which hasbeen
taken asequivalentto'sacrifice,' viz.oloolo,itisimportantto
observe that theword isnotemployedinreference tothe

whopresentstheofferingtothespirit1

ofpropitiatingaspiritafteranoffence, aswell asameans of
obtaining what isdesired. Food also isbynomeans commonly
thethingoffered;intheBanks' Islandsperhaps nothingbut
native moneyistheoffering.
Thespirits who areapproachedwith theseofferingsare
almostalwaysconnected with stones onwhich theofferings
aremade. Such stones have some ofthem been sacred to
somespirit from ancient times, andtheknowledgeofthe
waytoapproachthespiritwho isconnected withthem has
beenhanded down tothemanwhonowpossessesit.But
anymanmayfindastone forhimself, theshapeofwhich

andtherefore connected with aspirit. Hegetsmoney and

andthrows them down, saying,'LetSo-and-So recover.'
When thesickman recovers hepaysafee. Ifaman desires
togetthebenefit ofthestone, orwhatever itis,known to
another, with aview toincrease ofmoney, pigsorfood, or
success infighting,thepossessor ofthestone willtakehimto
hissacredplace, whereprobablythere aremany stones, each

worshipper putsmoney down. Ofanother hesaysitisaboar,
ofanother that itisapigwith tusks, andmoneyisputdown.
Thenotion isthat thespirit,vuiyattached tothestone likes
