regularcourse ofnature, andtoreside inspiritual beings,
whether inthespiritual partofliving men orintheghosts
ofthedead, being imparted bythem totheirnames and to
variousthingsthatbelongtothem, such asstones, snakes,
andindeedobjectsofallsorts, isthatgenerally known as
mana. Without some understandingofthis itisimpossible

malete, isused, which bears however thesame meaning.

peopleofMala Masiki, the lesserpartoftheisland, which

Bywhatever name itiscalled, itisthebelief inthissuper-

whichspiritsandghosts canbeinduced toexercise itforthe
benefit ofmen, that isthefoundation oftheritesandpractices
which canbecalledreligious;and itisfrom thesame belief
thateverythingwhich maybecalled MagicandWitchcraft
draws itsorigin. Wizards-, doctors, weather-mongers, prophets,
diviners, dreamers, allalike, everywhereintheislands, work
bythispower.There aremanyofthesewhomaybesaidto
exercise their artasaprofession;theygettheirproperty and
influence inthisway. Everyconsiderablevillageorsettle-
ment issuretohavesome onewhocancontrol theweather and
thewaves, some onewhoknows how totreat sickness, some
onewhocanwork mischief with various charms. Theremay
beonewhose skillextends toallthese branches;butgenerally
onemanknows how todoonething andoneanother. This
various knowledgeishanded down from father toson,from
uncle tosister's son,inthesamewayasistheknowledgeof
theritesandmethods ofsacrifice andprayer;andveryoften
thesamemanwhoknows thesacrifice knows alsothemaking
oftheweather, andofcharms formany purposesbesides.
But asthere isnoorder ofpriests,there isalsonoorder of
magiciansormedicine-men. Almost everymanofconsidera-
tionknows how toapproach someghostorspirit, andhas
some secret ofoccultpractices. Knowledgeofeither kind can
bebought,ifthepossessorchooses toimpartittoanyother
than theheirs ofwhatever hehasbesides.
There isnodoubt thatthosewho exercise these artsreally

believe inthepowerofthem asmuch asthepeopleonwhose
behalftheyexercise them. Insome cases there isconscious
deceit, such ashasbeenmany times confessed bythosewho
havebecome Christians. Ayoung-woman ofmyacquaintance
intheBanks' Islands hadareputationforpowerofhealing-
toothache byacharm which hadbeen taughtherbyan
agedrelative deceased. Shewouldlayacertain leaf rolled
upwith certain muttered words upon thepartinflamed;and
when incourse oftime thepain subsided, shewould takeout
andunfold theleaf,andshewwithin itthelittlewhitemaggot
thatwasthecause ofthetrouble. When Christian teaching
beganintheisland shemade nodifficultyabout disclosing
the secret, and alllaughedover ittogether.Itislikely
enoughalsothat aweather- doctor observed forhimself, and
wastaught byhispredecessortoobserve, thesignsofchange
andsteadiness inweather, andbroughthischarms towork or
keptthem backaccordingtohisobservations. Butthemeans
heusedseemed tohim tobesonaturally effective, andhad
been sooften followed bythe results atwhich theywere
aimed, thatheseriouslybelieved inthem;and ifsometimes
theyfailedconspicuously,aswhen atYsabel theweather-
doctor's ownhouse wasblown down byastorm onthevery
dayonwhich hehadwarranted acalm, there wasalsotheex-
planationthatanother counter-charm hadbeen atwork and
hadbeenstronger. Such asuppositiontended toconfirm
much more than toweaken thebelief inthepowerofweather-
doctors. ItisnotonlyinMelanesian islands thatwhatever
confirms abelief isaccepted andwhatever makesagainstitis
notweighed. Thosewhopractised thevarious kinds ofmagic
didbelieveverymuch intheirown art.
Thoughthosewhopractisethese various artscannot be
separatedintovarious classes ororders, oreven regardedas
anorder bythemselves, inasmuch astheyaremixed among
thepopulation, andpractiseastheyknow some more some
fewer arts, itwill bealmost necessarytoclassifytheir
practices. Thesemaybearrangedunder theheads ofSick-
ness,Weather, Witchcraft, Dreams, ProphecyandDivination,

notonly because some offence, such asatrespass, hasbeen
committedagainst them, orbecause onefamiliar withthem
hassoughttheir aidwith sacrifice andspells,butbecause there
isacertainmalignityinthefeelingofallghosts towards the
living, who offend them bybeingalive.'Allhumanpowers

InWangoinSanCristoval thenatives notlongagobelieved

another over thesickwithspears.Amanwould have a
grudge against another, andpayawizard tobring an'adaro to

hehadgivenapig,asitmight be,tothat wizard, andthe
manwhose lifewasaimed at,orhisfriends, would goto

(2)Weather. Inallthese islands itisbelieved thatspirits
andghostshavepowerovertheweather;itfollows, therefore,
that themenwhohave familiar intercourse withspirits and
ghostsarebelieved tobeable tomovethem tointerfere for
wind orcalm, sunshine orrain, asmaybedesired. The
spiritsandghostsalsohaveimparted powertoforms ofwords,
stones, leaves, andotherthings, which therefore ofthemselves
affect theweather;andthere isalsoacertain natural con-
gruity between some ofthesethings andthe effect they
produce, which seems tomakethem suitable vehicles ofpower.
Themen, therefore, whohaveandknow thesethings have
withthem manawhich theycanusetobenefit ortoafflict
friends andenemies, and toturn either wayasitismade
worth their while toturn it.There areeverywhere, therefore,
inthese islands weather-doctors orweather-mongers whocan
control the aerialpowers, and arewillingtosupply wind,
calm, rain, sunshine, famine, andabundance ataprice. These
weregenerallyalsomasters ofother charms than those which
affect theweather, someknew oneweather charm andsome
another;butthere weregenerallyinacommunity enough
forallrequirements.Their artsonce secret arenowpretty
wellknown. InFlorida themanenggehe vigona, when acalm
waswanted, tiedtogethertheleavesappropriatetohisvigoua
andhidthem inthehollow ofatreewhere water was, calling
uponthevigona spiritwith theproper charm. Thisprocess
wouldbring down rain tomake thecalm. Ifsunshine was

IntheseafaringlifeoftheSolomon Islands themaker of
calms isavaluable citizen. TheSanta Cruzpeoplealsoare
great voyagers,andtheir mendtka wizards control theweather
ontheirexpeditions, taking withthem thestock which
representstheir duka^ andsettingitupinthecabin onthe
stageofthecanoe. Thepresenceofhisfamiliar chikabeing
thus secured, theweather-doctor willundertake toprovidefair

charms have theirpowerbecause ofTagaro's name inthem.
Together with weather-charms maybeclassed those used
intheBanks' Islands toassist asowinher first litter of
pigs:such asbeatingherback with branches ofapepper
closely resemblingthatused forkava, strewingtheblossoms of
thewotaga, Barringtonia, upon herback, layingcocoa-nut
fronds onher,breakingabamboo water-vessel overherback so
thatthesalt-water mayrunover her,hangingabagfullof
native almonds above herhead;allbeing donewith theap-
propriate form ofwords. Nets alsoused forthe firsttime are

Lepers'Island when alargenewcanoe isfinished, and isforthe

charms which, substantially thesame incharacter with these,
assist thosewhoknowthem orpayforthem, orelseinjur>or
obstruct their enemies. Inprospect ofafight,forexample,
besides hisamulets and stones, aman intheBanks' Islands
wouldstrengthenhishand toshoot and killbydrinkingan
infusion ofverybitter herbs andbark;andbychewingother
leaves andpuffingforth their magicinfluence would dis-
hearten anapproaching enemy.

often thesamemenwho cause them, themana derived from
spiritsandghosts beinginboth cases theagent employed;
but itoftenhappensthatthedarker secrets ofthemagicart
arepossessed andpractised onlybythose whose powerliesin
doing harm, andwho areresorted towhen itisdesired to
bringeviluponanenemy.Their secrets, like others con-
nected with mana, arepassed down from onegenerationto
another, andmaybebought. Themostcommon workingof
thismalignantwitchcraft isthat, socommon among savages,
inwhich afragmentoffood, bitofhair ornail, oranything
closely connected with thepersontobeinjured,isthemedium
through which thepoweroftheghostorspiritisbroughtto
bear. Some relic such asabone ofthedeadperson whose
ghostissettoworkis,ifnotnecessary, verydesirable for
bringinghispowerinto thecharm;andastonemayhave
itsmana fordoingmischief. What isneeded isthebringing
togetherofthemanwho istobeinjured andthespiritor
ghost who istoinjure him;thiscanbedonewhen some-
thing whichpertainstotheman'spersoncanbeused, such as
ahair, anail,aleafwithwhich hehaswipedtheperspiration
from hisface,andwithequaleffectwhen afragmentofthe
foodwhich haspassedintothemanforms thelinkofunion.
Hence inFlorida when ascrap from aman's meal could be
secreted andthrown into thevunuJia haunted bythetindalo
ghost,themanwouldcertainlybe ill;and intheNew
Hebrides when themaesnake carried awayafragmentof
food intotheplacesacred toaspirit,themanwhohadeaten
ofthefoodwould sicken asthefragment decayed.Itwas
forthis reason aconstant care toprevent anythingthat
might beused inwitchcraft fromfallinginto thehands of
ill-wishers;itwastheregular practicetohide hairandnail-
parings, andtogivetheremains offoodmostcarefullytothe
pigs1
.IntheBanks' Islands thefragmentoffood, orwhat-

ever itmay be,bywhich aman ischarmed iscalled garata ;
thiswasmade upbythewizard with abitofhuman bone,
andsmeared with amagicdecoction inwhich itwould rot
away. Orthegarata would beburnt, andwhile itwas
burning-thewizardsanghischarm;asthegarata was
consumed, thewizard burningitbydegrees dayafterday,
themanfromwhom itcame sickened, andwould die,the
ghostofthemanwhose bonewasburning would takeaway
his life. Ifthenanymanwhoknows hehasanenemyhas
reason himself tothink thatsomethinghasbeentaken from
him, orhisfriends hear that agarata fromhim isinsome
wizard's hands, heortheywillgivemoneytogetthe
fragmentback;andtheenemy again and hisfriends will
givemore tosecure thecontinuance ofthecharm. InAurora
thefragmentoffood ismadeupwith certain leaves;asthese
rotandstink theman dies. InLepers'Island thegaratais
boiled, togetherwith certain magical substances, inaclam
shell withcharms which callonTagaro.Itisevident that
noonewhointends tobringmischief toamanbyafragment
ofhisfood willpartakeofthatfood himself, because bydoing
sohewouldbringthemischief alsoonhimself. Hence a
nativeoffering even asingle banana toavisitor will bitethe
endofitbefore hegives it,andaEuropean giving medicine

.
Another charm iscommon toboth eastern andwestern
islands, which iscalled intheBanks' Islands talamatai. A
bitofhuman bone, afragmentofcoral, asplinterofwood, or
ofanarrow bywhich aman hasdied,isbound upwith the
leaves which havemana forthepurpose,with themanasong ;
bythismeans thepoweroftheghostisbound into the

Another remarkableengineofmischief iscalled inthe
Banks' Islandstamatetiqa, ghost-shooter. Since this isused
also inFlorida itmaybesupposedtobecommon toallthese
islands. Abitofbamboo isstuffed withleaves, adeadman's
bone, andothermagical ingredients,theproper manasong
being chanted over it.FastingintheBanks' Islands, butnot
apparentlyintheSolomon Islands, addspowertothisand
other charms. Themanwhohasmade orbought oneofthese
holds itinhishand, with theopen end ofthebamboo
covered with histhumb, tillhesees hisenemy;then helets
outthemagicinfluence andshoots hisman. Someyears ago

Toaddforce totheghostly dischargehefasted somany days
before thefeastbeganthatwhen thedayarrived hewastoo
weak towalk. When thepeoplehadassembled, hehad
himself carried outand setdown attheedgeoftheopen
space where thedancing would goon. Allthemen there
knew thattherewasoneofthem hemeant toshoot;noone
knew whether itwas himself. There hesatasthedancers
rapidly passed himcircling round, afearfulobject,black with
dirtandwasted toaskeleton withfasting,histamatetiqa
within hisclosedfingers stoppedwith histhumb, histrembling
armstretched out,andhisblearedeyeswatchingforhisenemy.
Every man trembled inwardlyashedanced byhim,andthe
attention ofthewhole crowd wasfixedonhim. After awhile,
bewildered anddazed with hisownweakness, therapidmove-
ments ofthedancers, andthenoise, hemistook hisman;he
raised hisarmand lifted histhumb. Themanheaimed at
fellatonceupontheground, andthedancersstopped. Then
hesawthathehad failed, andthat thewrong manwas hit,
and hisdistress wasgreat ;butthemanwhohadfallen and
wasreadytoexpire, when hewasmade tounderstand thatno
harm wasmeant him,tookcourage againtolive,andpresently
revived. Nodoubt hewould have died ifthemistake had
notbeenknown.
There isastrange method ofmagicalattack used atSavo,
andknown atFlorida, called vele,aword which means to
pinch. Themanwhohasthesecret ofthistakes inabag
uponhisback theleaves andotherthingsinwhich mana for
thispurpose resides, andseeks tofindtheman alone hegoes
toinjure. When hefindshim,heseizes him, bites hisneck,
stuffs themagicleaves down histhroat, andknocks himon
thehead withanaxe,butnotsoastokillhim.Hethen
leaves theman,whogoeshome, relates what hashappened, and
diesaftertwodays,Iftheattack ismade inthenight,theman
cannot tellwho hisassailant was;butthevele isused alsoin
broaddaylight, andtheassailant doesnotconceal himself, but
tellshisname andbids hisvictim make itknown. Ashegoes
home thecharm makes himforgetit.Astrong man willnot

beattacked inthisway. Thesamethingisdone inGuadal-
canar, andthepeopleofSaaattheextremityofMalanta hear
ofitatMarau Sound bythename ofhele.AtLepers' Island,
intheNew Hebrides, thevequa verymuch resembles this.
Thewizard overcomes hisvictim with hischarms, sothatthe
man cannotdistinctlyseehim ordefend himself; then he
shoots himwith alittlebowandarrowmade ofsomecharmed
material, andstrikes himwith thearrow. Theman doesnot
know what isdone tohim,buthegoeshome, fallsill,and
dies;hecanremember nothingtotellhisfriends, butthey
seethewound inhisheadwhere hewasstruck, andinhis
sidewhere hewas shot, andknow what hashappened
tohim.
Thepracticeofmagicarts formischief isintheBanks'
Islands andinLepers'Island calledgaqaleva, and isalways
dreaded incase ofsickness. InLepers'Island thewizards
whopractiseitarebelieved tohave thepower ofchanging
theirshape. The friends ofanyonesuffering from sickness
arealwaysafraid lestthewizard who hascaused thedisease
should come insome form, asofablow-fly, and strike the
patient;theysitwithhim therefore andusecounter-charms
toguard him,anddrivecarefully awayallflies, lesthisenemy
should come inthat form. Somemenbygaqalevacanturn
intoashark and eatanenemy,ormorecommonly some one
whom hisenemyhashired thewizard todestroy. Thestoryof
Tarkeke shews thisbelief inAurora also,where, asinLepers'
Island andinPentecost, magiciansturn intoeagles andowls
aswell assh'arks. Thispowerisnotalwaysused formalicious
ends, aswasshewn byMolitavile atLepers'Island. Avessel
'
recruiting labour/ called bythenatives a'
thief-ship/ had
carried awaysomepeoplefrom theisland, and their friends
wereveryanxious toknow whathadbecome ofthem. Moli-
tavile, whohadthepowerofchanginghisform, undertook
toturn himself intoaneagleandflyafter the vessel. He
told allthepeopleofthevillageinthe firstplacetokeep
away from that side oftheopen space between thehouses
from whence hewould take hisflight. Then heentered


2o8 Magic. [CH.
into ahouse decorated with cocoa-nut fronds, andthey
sawnomore;buttheyknew that hedrank thekava he
hadprepared,andthenlaydown tillhissoulwent out
ofhim intheform ofabirdandfollowed theship.After
awhile heemergedfrom thehouse, and told thepeople
that allwho hadbeen carried away were well but one,
whowasdead. Long1afterwards, when some ofthosewho
were thenonboard returned, theysaidthathehadbrought
back thetruth, oneofthembythattimehaddied.
(4)Dreams. Thenative belief astothenature ofdreams,
and astothepart played bythesoul ofmen indreams,
isasubjectofenquirywhichbelongsrather tothegeneral
questionastotheconceptionsthepeople have ofthenature of
thesoul itself andofhuman life;buttheuseofdreamingas
abranch ofthepracticeofmagic comesappropriatelyinto
view inthisplace.InMaewo, Aurora, intheNew Hebrides,
thedreaming-man,tatuaqoreqore, whomaybealsoinother
waysagismanainhisuseofsupernatural power,isinrequest
incases ofsickness. Inanordinary case,when itissupposed
that aghostisthecause ofthecomplaint, thefriends ofthe
sickmansend fortheprofessionaldreamer andgivehimnow
tobacco, asformerly theygave mats, tofindoutwhatghost
hasbeen offended, andtomake itupwith him. Hesleeps,
andinhisdreamgoestotheplace where thesickman has

likely,ofsmall size,whoreallyisaghost, andhelearns from
himwhat ishisname. Theghosttellshimthatthesickman
ashewasworkinghasencroached uponhisground,theplace

Thedreamer begsforthereturn ofthesoul,andaskspardon
onbehalf ofthesickman,whomeant nodisrespect ;theghost
pullsupthefence inwhich thesoul isenclosed, andlets itout;
theman ofcourse recovers. These dreamers areable alsoto
visitMalanga, anabode ofthedead. Sometimes ifachild is
sick itissupposedthatthere issome oneinMalanga drawing
awayitssoul. Theconjectureisthatthesouloftheinfant is

infactthat ofsome onewhohasdiedandgonetoMalanga,
buthasafterwards desired tocome back toearth, andhasbeen
born astheinfant thatnow issick;and,moreover, thatthe
mother inMalanga,notwishing-tolosethesocietyofher
child there,isdrawingback there-born infant's soul. The
dreamerhavingreceived hisfeegoesinadream toMalanga,
andintercedes with themother there;hegetsback thesoul,
andthechild recovers. InSaa alsointheSolomon Islands,
ifachild starts initssleepitisbelieved thatsomeghostis

Awizard doctor undertakes togoinsleep andbringitback;
hedreams andgoes ;ifthosewhohavetaken the'shadow'let
himtake itback thechild recovers, but ifthechild diesthe
dreamerreportsthattheywould not lethimcome nearthem.
Inthesameplacewhen athingislostawizard isengagedto

hidden crime somewizard whounderstands howtodoitdrinks
kava, and sothrows himself into amagic sleep. When he
wakes hedeclares thathehasseentheculpritandgiveshis
name.
(5)Prophecy. Theknowledgeoffuture events isbelieved
tobeconveyedtothepeople byaspiritoraghost speaking
with thevoice ofaman, oneofthewizards, who ishimself
unconscious while hespeaks.InFlorida themen ofavillage
would besittingintheir kiala^ canoe-house, anddiscussing
some undertaking, anexpedition probablytoattack some
unsuspecting village. Oneamong them,known tohave his
own tindaloghostofprophecy,would sneeze andbeginto
shake, asignthatthetindalo hadentered intohim;hiseyes
wouldglare,hislimbs twist, hiswhole bodybeconvulsed,
foam would burst from hislips ;then'avoice, nothisown,
would beheard inhisthroat, allowingordisapprovingofwhat
wasproposed. Such amanusednomeans ofbringing onthe
ghost ;itcameuponhim, ashebelieved himself, atitsown will,
itsmanaoverpowered him,andwhen itdeparteditlefthim
quiteexhausted. Still aman towhom thishappened, when
hehadareputationasaprophet, would beemployedtoassist
p

inthecouncil andmake thatabranch ofhisprofessionasa
wizard. Thedescriptionofprophecy giveninSanCristoval
isidentical withtheforegoing1
.InSaa,menwhoarepossessed
with alioaprophesyofthingstocome. InLepers'Island
itisbelieved thatthespirit Tagaro putshispowerasaspirit
intoaman, manag, sothathespeaks what otherwise hecould
not, inthewayofforetelling thingstocome, aswell asof
making known what isconcealed. Theseprophetsarecon-
sulted when anew gamali, thehouse oftheSuqe Society,
istobebuilt, toknow ifthere willbepeaceorwar;because
anumber ofpeople assemble forsuch apurpose, and ifthere is
dangeroffighting theywillnotleave their homes.
(6)Divination. There aremany methods bywhichghosts
andspiritsarebelieved tomakeknown tomenwhousethem
the secretthings which theunassisted humanintelligence
could notfindout;andsome ofthesehardlyneedperhapsthe
intervention ofawizard. These methods ofdivination differ
verylittle inthevarious islands. IntheSolomon Islands,
inFlorida forinstance, when anexpeditionhasstarted ina
fleet ofcanoes, there issometimes ahesitation whetherthey
shallproceed,oraquestioninwhat directiontheyshallgo.Amanekim divines;hedeclares thathehas feltatindalo
comeonboard, foronesideofthecanoe hasbeenpressed down;
heasks therefore thequestion,'Shallwego?shallwego

bringing some onewithhim toassist, andthetwo sitdown,

with onehand theendofthebamboo heholds, calling one
after another thenames ofmennotverylongdeceased;when
henames theonewho isafflictingthesickman thestick of

tion iscalled gogondo. Theoperator whoknows thisarttakes

knows, andwiththem other leaves, vines ofcreepers, andbark
belonging-toeach tindalo, inwhich themana ofeach resides.
With these hegoestotheplace sacred tohisgogondo, andthe
peopleinterested assemble. Then hetiestheleaves tohis
ownbody, andbeginstosplit each draca3na leafdown the
middle. Each leafanswers toatindalo, and ifaleafsplits

sickman. Thesame gogondoisused toseewhether asick
man will live ordie;iftheleafrepresenting thepatient

andtheother Banks' Islandstheydivinedbymeans ofabam-
boointowhich aghosthad entered, andwhichpointed of
itself tothethief orotherculprittobediscovered. Acommon
method ofdivination intheBanks' Islands iscalled soilo,and
isused toenquire where alostpersonorthingistobefound,
who isthe thief, whether anabsent friend isalive ordead.
Thehands arelifted over theheadandrubbedtogetherwith
amagic song calling onaghost. Thesignisgiven bythe
crackingofthejoints ;when thequestionisoflifeordeath,,
ifthethumbs orshoulders crack theman still lives, ifthe

occasionallyinuseatMotlav inthesamegroup.After a

andscraped banana into it.Then anewbamboo some tenfeet
longwas fitted tothebagandtiedwithoneendinthemouth

boothey saywould runabout with amanwhohad itlying

native informant, thoughitmoved inmen's hands itnever
moved when noonetouched it.
(7)Ordeals. Toclear ortoconvict amanaccused ofguilt
there areordeals managed bymenwithwhom themagicin-
struments, andtheknowledgeofthecharms bywhich they
canbeused, remain. There areseveral ordeals used atSaa
whichmaystand asexamples from theSolomon Islands. One
iscalled thedaufieu, stoneworking,theknowledgeofthe
useofwhich ispassed down fromman tomanwith themagic
stone which isemployed. Anaccusedperson goestotheman
who hasthestone andengages him toundergotheordeal.
Thepeopleassemble andtheaccused denies thecharge, and
hesubmits tothe ordealthroughhiscompurgator. The
latter heats thestone andthrows itfromhand tohand;if
hishands arenotburnt theaccused ispronounced innocent,
andpaysaporpoise-toothfee. There ismuchpreparation
with averyyoung cocoa-nut, theflower ofsugar-cane and
chanted charms tomake theproceeding saka, hot,withsuper-
naturalpower.Itisprobablethatsometimes theaccusers
make theirpreparationsalsowith abribe. Another consists
intheapplicationofalightedbundle ofcocoa-nut fronds to
thelegsoftheaccused, whostands upforitoristiedbetween
twoposts.This isdonewithcharms bythemanwhomanages
it,andalsogetshis fee. Inanother theaccused swallows a
charmed stone heated bythewizardemployed,and isinnocent
ifhetakes noharm. Inafourth theaccused eatsabitofa
cocoa-nut which hasbeenmadeverysaka forthepurpose,
andbroken inpieces ;ifheisguilty hefallsafterwards from
atree orsome other accident befalls him, orhepines away.

Another method istotakealmonds from asacredplaceand
mashthem with acharm
;theaccused eatsand isjudged
guiltyifheistheworse for it.There isagainaveryancient
spearatSaa,very saka,fullofmagic power,called usu,dog,
because ithasdogs'teeth uponit.This isplaced onthe
head oftheaccused andhesays,'IfIdidthething, mayI
diewith thisspear ;'ifheisguilty hesickens and dieswith
thepowerofthespear. There isalsoaverysacredsong,
verysaka. Thewizard whoknows itsings it,andtheac-
cusedmansays,'Well, thatsongisforme;ifIdidthat let
meandmychildren suffer.'Finally,there isthealligator
ordeal, used inthepassage between Mala Paina andMala
Masiki, where thereptilesarevery numerous. Aman ac-
cused ofserious crime istaken there;thewizard whomanages
theordeal callsthealligators with hischarms, andtheaccused
who isconfident inhisinnocence andinthewizard's power
dares toswim across. Noone willholdhimguiltyifhe
escapes.Inthis ordeal also itissometimes nottheaccused,
butthemanwhoknows thecharm whosubmits himself to
the test. InLepers'Island aman toprovehisinnocence
willsubmit tobeshot atwith arrows;ifhebehitheisof
courseguilty ;ifhebeinnocent, Tagarowillprotect him, just
asheprotectsinfighting anyyoung manwhom hepreserves
thathemaybeprosperous andgreat. Thefavour ofTagaro
ineither case issoughtforwith theappropriatecharm.
(8)Poison. Tothebest ofmyknowledgetheMelanesian
peoplewere notacquainted with theuseofanysubstance
which, when taken with food ordrink, would beinjurious by
itsnaturalproperties,untiltheylearnt theuseofarsenic from
Queensland. Returned'labourers'
broughtthatback with
them, andused itwith fatal effect inthesamewayinwhich
nativepoisonersused theirown magical preparations, by
mixingitinfood;and itismore thanprobablethat the
certain and fatal effect wasbelieved then tobeduetothe
powerful magicalandnotnaturalpowerswithwhich itwas
endued. Atany rate, ifwhat nativemagicians employedin
poisoningfoodhadanynaturallynoxiousqualities (whichis


214 Magic. [CH.
notdenied),itwasnotanynaturallynoxiousproperty which
wasexpectedtoproducetheinjuriousresult;norwhen
mischief followed was itascribed tothenaturalqualityof
what hadbeen administered;themagic charms hadinnative
belief thepowerofpoisoning,andcommunicated ittothe
preparationwhich wasmixed with thefood.Nodoubt the
materials overwhich thepoison charm wassungwere such as
seemed tohave acertain congruity with the effect tobe
produced. The secrets ofpoison-making have notbecome
known;butinFlorida itisbelievedbythepeoplethatthe
liver ofablack snake dried inthesunoroverafirewasthe
chiefingredientinthepoisons which were used there. There
were certainpersons whoknew the art,andwere hired to
poison withmaomao, made with themanapowerofthetindalo
ghost belongingtothesorcereremployed, andmixed inthe
food ofthemanwhose lifewasaimed at.TheSavopeople
weregreat poisoners;Florida menwho visited them were
careful what theyate.The effect ofthepoison wasthatone
whohadtaken itfell sick, vomited, andafterwards died.
Thepracticeofthis artwasdangeroustothepoisoner;a
knownpoisoner wasputtodeath inFlorida, and sowere
manyinnocentpersons suspectedoraccused. IntheBanks'
Islands topoison wastovangan pal,tofeedbystealth. The
Ureparapara peopleinthatgroup hadthereputeofbeing
poisoners,others wouldgetpoison from thence;inMota no
oneknew the art. InLepers'Islandpoisoniscalled, bya
parallel expression,aruwana;allthat Ihave learnt ofitis
thatthepreparationofitisvery secret, andthat itismade
withcharms inthesamewaywiththegarata above described.
Infactthecorrespondence between thenativepoison andthe
charm thatworks destruction throughafragmentoffood is
complete:intheonecaseaportionofthefoodalready eaten
bythepersontobeinjuredismixed with certainmagically
powerful substances; intheother themagically powerful
substances aremixed inthefood tobeeaten. Ineither case,
accordingtothenative belief, themischief wascausedby
magic. Aman eating away from hisclosest friends was in


xii.] Taboo.215
equalfear lest lieshould becharmed throughafragmentofhis
food orpoisoned bywhat mightbeputinto hisfood. The
poisoned arrows, ofwhich more hereafter, have never been
found tohavebeenprepared withanything which could bepro-
perlysaidtobepoison ;andundoubtedlythedreaded powerof
sucharrows togivefatalwounds wasbythenatives believed
tobeduetothemagic charms with which theyweremade,
andtothedeadman's bonewithwhich theywerepointed.
(9)Tapu and Curses. Theword taboo isoneofthevery
fewthatthelanguagesofthePacific Ocean havegiventothe
English language;andsomethingofitsmeaningtherefore
maybesupposedtobeunderstood. Butthetapuortambu of
Melanesia isnotsoconspicuousinnative lifeasthetapuof
Polynesia ;and itdiffers alsoperhapsinthis,that itnever
signifies anyinherent holiness orawfulness, butalwaysa
sacred andunapproachablecharacter which isimposed.This
isnotstrictlyaccurate asregardstheword intheSolomon
Islands, where everythingconnected with aghostofworship,
tindalo, lio'a, or'adaro,istambu ofitself;itisaccurate ascon-
cerns theBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides, where what is
inherentlysacred isrongo orsapuga. But stillincaseswhere
theEnglish word taboo canbeemployedthere isalwaysin
Melanesia human sanction andprohibition. Something,
action, orplaceismade tambu ortapubyonewhohasthe

powerattheback ofthetapuortambu isthat oftheghostor

nounced;forthetapuisaprohibition with acurseexpressed

peanaproofofthepowerofthechief;buttothenative the
powerofthechief, inthisandineverything else, restsonthe
persuasionthatthechief hashistindalo athisback. The
sense ofthisintheparticularcase isremote, theapprehension


216 Magic. [CH.
ofangeringthechief ispresent and effective, buttheultimate
sanction isthepowerofthe tindalo. Ifacommon man

people would think thathewould notdoitunless heknew
thathehadthepowertodoit;theywould watch, and ifany
onewho violated histambu were tofallsick,hewould be
recognizedatonce asonewhohadapowerful tindalo, andhe
would rise. Each tindalo hashisspecial leaf,andaman will
sethistambu with theleafofhis tinclalo asamark;mendo
notalways know whose leaf itis,buttheyknow thatthey
have todealwith atindalo, notonlywith aman,iftheydis-
regardthemark. Thetambu istooconvenient aninstitution
todropwhen theoriginalsanction ofithasceased tooperate ;
anative Christian teacher therefore doesnothesitate,asa
man ofpositioninsociety,tosetatambu;thieves hesaysare
afraid ofaman ifnotofatindalo. IntheBanks' Islands
there isaminorprohibition, soloi, aswell asthemore solemn

natural sanction. Butamanbyvirtue ofthesupernatural

Stronger thananyindividual sanction wasthat ofthesecret

ofapigormoney would appease theindividual orsociety

Itisevident thatatambuapproachesto,acurse,when itis

Thus atSaa, afewyears ago,thechief forbade theyoung

andwouldgivenothingtothechief,whothereupon professed
himselfquite unable toremove thecurse.
Acursebywayofasseveration isverycommon inFlorida,
andnodoubt intheother Solomon Islands. Aman willdeny
anaccusation byhisforbidden food, butonggu!bysome tindalo,
Daula, theghostly frigate-bird,orBagea, theghostlyshark.
The Floridapeople, and theirneighbours probably, were
sufficientlyadvanced togarnishtheir conversation withprofane
andfilthy swearing, even before 'contact with civilization'
put
into their mouths those words which aretoooften the first
theylearn ofEnglish.Iamnotaware oftheexistence ofthis
habit intheBanks' Islands. Themore serious curse there is
tovagona,tomake into atangle,toprohibit easyaccess

CHAPTEE XIIT.
POSSESSION. INTERCOURSE WITH GHOSTS.
ITisdifficult toseparatethepracticeofmagicartsfrom the
manifestation ofaghost'sorspirit's powerinpossession;because
amanmayusesomemagic means tobringthepossession upon
himself,as"inthe case ofprophecy, and alsobecause the
connexion between theunseen powerful beingandtheman,
inwhatever waytheconnexion ismade andworks,isthat
which makes thewizard. Yetthere isadistinction between
thewitchcraft andsorceryinwhich bymagiccharms thewizard
bringstheunseen powerinto action, andthespontaneous mani-
festation ofsuchpower bytheunseen being; eventhough
theremaybeonlyafewwhocaninterpret,ortowhom the
manifestations aremade. Inacase ofmadness thenative
belief isthatthemadman ispossessed.There isatthesame
time aclear distinction drawn bythenatives between the
actsandwords ofthedelirium ofsickness inwhich astheysay
theywander, andthose which areowingtopossession. They
aresorryforlunatics and arekind tothem, thoughtheir
remedies arerough. AtFlorida, forexample, oneKandagaru
ofBoliwent outofhismind, chasedpeople,stolethingsand
hidthem. Nooneblamed him,because theyknew thathewas
possessed byatindaloghost.Hisfriends hired awizard who
removed thetindalo, andherecovered. Inthesamewaynot
longagoinLepers'Island therewasamanwho losthissenses.
Thepeople conjecturedthathehadunwittinglytrodden ona

doctors were called in;theyfound outwhoseghostitwasby
calling onthenames ofdeadmenlikelytohavebeen offended,
theywashed himwithwatermade powerful withcharms, and
theyburned thevessel inwhich themagic water hadbeen
under hisnose;hegotwell. Inasimilar casetheywillput

drew hisbow atpeople, and carriedthingsoff.Thepeople
pitied him,and tried tocurehim. When aman insuch
condition inthat islandspoke,itwasnotwith hisown voice,

Heremaybementioned alsocertain tricks whichghosts or

play. AtMota intheBanks' Islands alittle boynamed
Peitavunana, heavenly water, wasfrightened andchased bya
ghost upthemountain. Hewassoughtforinvain,anda

announced thathewould befound inacertainveryinaccessible

excrement, thefoodofghosts,andstreaming with blood from
thethorns through which hehadbeen forced, and inhis
handanunripefruit ofthemammy-apple. Hesaidthat his
dead mother hadcome tohimandgiven himthe food.
Another littleboy,Nungwia, sleeping onthebeach atnight,
wasconveyed byaghostinto averysmallcavitybeneath a
rock, intowhich itwasimpossibleforhim tohave climbed.
InLepers'Islandtheyhave awayofplaying with aghost.
Theybuild alittle house intheforest near theirvillage and

they singthattheywishnottoreturn intothepath,andthey

Inthesamewayaclub isputatnightinto acycas-tree,
which hasasacred character, andwhen thename ofsome

about, andputupintoatreewould liftthem from theground.
This resembles agooddeal amethod ofdivination used at
Motlav, anddescribed above, butthere isnodivination in
these tricks.
There was,andperhapsstillis,intheTorres Islands some-
thingsimilar tothis,whenghosts influenced and took
possessionofpeoplewith theuseofsticks. This hasbeen
described byanative under thename ofNatametlingalinga^
bywhich name thosewhoaresubjectedtotheghostlyinfluence
arecalled. Itisdone, hewrites, onthefifthdayafter adeath.
There wasacertain man atLowhotook thelead,andwithout
whom nothingcould bedone;hegaveoutthathewould
descend into Panoi, theabode ofthedead,andhehadwith
himcertain others, assistants. Heand hispartywere called
simply'ghosts'when engagedinthe affair. The firstthing
was toassemble thosewhowerewillingtobetreated ina

makethem liedown onthetwo sides,andtoshake overthem

with charms. Then theleader andhisassistants went into all
thesacredplaces whichghosts haunt, such aswhere men
wash offtheblack ofmourning, collectingastheywent the
ghosts andbecomingthemselves somuchpossessedthatthey
appearedtohave losttheir senses, though they acted ina
certain method. Inthemeanwhile thesubjects lyinginthe
gamal begintobemoved;thosewhobringasthey saythe
ghoststothem goquietly alongboth sides ofthehouse with-
out,and allatonce strike thehousealongitswholelength
with thesticksthey carryintheir hands. This startles those
inside, andtheyrollabout onthegrounddistracted. Then
the'ghosts'enter inwith their sticks, andinthisperformance
each isbelieved tobesome onedeceased, oneTagilrow,another
Qatawala;they leapfrom side toside,turningtheir sticks
over tobebeatenbythesubjects onone sideandtheother.
Thesubjectsaregivensticks forthispurpose,and asthey
strike thestick theghost'

open placeofthevillage, where theyareseen. They appear
nottorecognizeorhearanyonebutthe'

Itwillhardlybeinappropriatehere tointroduce the

angrywith him,perhaps cursing himbycalling onhisown
tindalo toeathim;themanwho sneezes callsuponhis

samewayatSaa ifaman sneezes when hewakes, hecries,
'Who callsme 1Ifforgood,well;ifforevil,maySo-and-So

one issupposedtobecallingthename ofamanwhen he

themother willcry,'Lethimcome back intotheworld !let

Thenotion isthat aghostisdrawingthechild's soulaway.
Ithasbeen said that atMota amanenquires when he

CHAPTEE XIV.
BIRTH. CHILDHOOD. MARRIAGE.
INattemptingtotrace thecourse ofaMelanesian life
from birth toburial wesoonmeet withpracticesconnected
with theCouvade. Aproper Couvade hasperhaps been
observed inSanCristoval alone, when theyoung1father was
foundlyinginafter thebirth ofhischild;and itshould be
observed that thiswaswhere thechild follows thefather's
kindred. There ismuch however whichapproachesthis. At
Saa itisnotonlytheexpectant mother who iscareful what
she eats, thefather alsoboth before and after the child's
birth refrains fromsome kinds offoodwhich would hurt the
child. Hewill noteatpig's flesh, andheabstains from
movements which arebelieved todoharm, upon theprinciple
that the father's movements affect those ofthe child.A
man willnotdohard work,liftheavy weights, orgooutto
sea;hekeeps quietlestthechild shouldstart, should over-
strain itself, orshould throw itself about ashepaddles.In
theBanks' Islands also, bothparents are careful what
theyeatwhen thechild isbom, theytakeonlywhat iftaken
bytheinfant would notmake itill;before thebirth ofher
first child themother must noteatfishcaught bythehook,
net, ortrap.After thebirth ofthe firstchild, thefather
doesnoheavywork foramonth;after thebirth ofanyof
hischildren, hetakes carenottogointo those sacredplaces,
tanorongo,intowhich thechild could notgowithout risk.
Itisthesame intheNew Hebrides; theexpectant Araga

child's birth, anddoesnotenter hishouse;after thebirth, he
doeswork inlookingafter hiswifeand child, buthemust
noteat shell-fish andotherproduceofthebeach,forthe
infant would suffer from ulcers ifhedid. InLepers' Island,
thefather isverycareful fortendays;hedoesnowork, will
notclimb atree, orgofarintotheseatobathe,forifhe
exerts himself the child will suffer. Ifduringthistime
hegoestoanydistance, astothebeach, hebrings backwith
him alittle stonerepresentingtheinfant's soul,which may
have followed him;arrived athome, hecries,'Come hither,'
andputsdown thestone inthehouse;then hewaits tillthe
child sneezes,, andhecries,'Here itis,'knowing then that
thesoulhasnotbeen lost.
Abortion andInfanticide wereverycommon. Ifawoman
didnotwant thetrouble ofbringing upachild, desired to
appear young,wasafraid herhusband might think thebirth
before itstime, orwished tospiteherhusband, shewould find
someonetoprocureabortion either bythejuiceofcertainplants
taken indrink orbytwistingandsqueezingthefoetus. Infan-
ticide wasmoreprevalentinsome islands than others;since
Christianteachinghasbeenintroduced agreatchangeisvisible
inMaewo, Aurora Island, and atWangoinSan Cristoval,
where thebirth ofaninfant wasoflateyears indeed anun-
usualthing, and allthechildren inthevillages hadbeen
boughtfrom inland. Inthosepartstheoldwomen ofthevil-
lagegenerallydetermined whether anewborn child should live;
ifnotpromisinginappearance,orlikelytobetroublesome,it
wasmadeaway with,itsmouth perhapsstuffed with leaves and
thebodycastintoaholeandcovered with astone. Inthe
Banks' Islands,ifofthewrongsexorotherwise unwelcome, the
infant waschoked assoon asborn. Male children were killed
rather thanfemale inthatgroup ;ifthere werefemale children
already,another would notbedesired;butthefemales were
ratherpreserved,asitisimportanttoobserve, because ofthe
family passing throughthefemale side, aswell aswith the
prospectofgainwhen thegirlshould bebetrothed andmarried.
There isnowhere inthegroups generallythepracticeof

killingoneoftwins, nor isthere anywhere anydislike tothe
birth oftwins further thanfrom thetroubletheyentail. In
someplaces,asatSaa,twins areliked;atMotlav thepeople
ofavillageareproudoftheir twins, andtheparents and
relations makemuch ofthem;noonewouldadopt oneof
them, because itwouldspoilthepleasureofseeing them
together,anddeprive them oftheir naturalrighttobe
together;theonlysadthingabout them isthatthey give
much trouble, andthattheparentswillbesosorryiftheydie.
InFlorida alone there seems tobesomethingofasuspicion
thattwofathers maybeconcerned;buttheytake itthatthe
woman hastrespassedonthesacredplace, vwnuka, ofsome
ghost, tindalo, whose powerliesthatway.InLepers'Island
also itisthoughtthat twins maybeagiftofTagaro.
Women whowant achild willgotoasacredplaceinhope
that thespiritwillgivethem one,andsometimes hegives
them two. There isnow intheisland oneMalavaiboe, Pig-
twin, thesurvivor oftwin sonsofArusese;thepeople believe
hewillturn outagreat man, notsomuch because heisa

theirmother when shewent toaskachild.
AtSaa,when anewborn infant iseightortendaysolda

clearlyinthisamovement towards thepatriarchal system,a
recognitionofthetieofblood throughthefather andofduties
that follow from it.Anothersignofthesame advance ofthe

prevailsintheBanks' Islands onthebirth ofafirst-born son;
there israised uponthat event, anoisy andplayful fight, vagalo,
afterwhich thefather buysofftheassailants withpaymentof

andthefather's paymenttobethequietingoftheir claim and
thesecuringofhisownpositionashead ofhisownfamily.
Aschildren grow theyremain intheir tenderyearsinthe
women's carewithin thehouse. Theyarecommonlyweaned
when theycancrawl. Their firstadvance inlifewhen they

concerning clothing.IntheBanks' Islands, where males of
anyagewore nothing, boysastheygrew bigger were sent to

Theboyputsonhismalo dresswhen hisparentsthink him

pathsherunsawayorhides. Ifaboyonthesands knows
that certainfootstepsarehis sister's, hewillnotfollow them,
norwill she his. Thismutual avoidancebegins when the
boyisclothed orthegirltattooed. Thepartition between
boysandgirlswithout which aschool cannot becarried onis
notthere todivide thesexesgenerally,buttoseparatebrothers
and sisters. This avoidance continuesthroughlife.The

friends take thepigs, mats, anduncooked food,and setthem

friends have already preparedcooked food, andthetwo
partieseattogether;themarriageisthuscomplete. The
bride iscarried onsomeone's back tohernewhome, wrapped
inmany mats, andwith palm-fans heldabout herface,because
she issupposedtobemodest andshy. Formerlythere was

ifsatisfaction were refused aquarrel would ensue.Anewly-
married husband, withoutwaiting-forobservations, would
often beat hisbride tomake herconfess who herparamour
hadbeen.
The oldhabits ofthepeopleinalltheislands werevery
strict inregardtoadultery. Thepunishment oftheman
wasdeath;butthepunishment wasverygenerally mitigated
onpaymentofafine. Thus inFlorida aninjured husband
would givemoneytothechief tohave theadulterer killed,
andhe,ifhecould, would make satisfaction inmoneytoboth
chiefandhusband, andsosave his life.Thewoman, however,
would probablybemade arembi, harlot, fortheprofitofthe
chief. AtSaaanadulterous wife isdismissed, and the
adulterer ispunishedwith death, exile, orfines. Incase of
adulteryinachief'sfamilyhewillhave theadulterer killed,
orreceivingalargefinewill lethimgotoUlawa andlive;
aman's friends willsometimes hidehim foratime, hoping
thatthechief willconsent totake afine,and iftheyfindhim
implacable,will killtheman themselves orgivehimup.
When thewronghasbeendoneamonglesser men, thefriends
ofthehusband andoftheadulterer willoftenfightabout the
damagestobeexacted;andfrom thiscause indeed most of
thefighting throughoutallthegroups proceeds. Achief of
Saa,Ulawa, Ugi,orSanCristoval, whohashadtheadulterer
killed, makes abea,astagefrom whichspeechesaremade,
andrewards thosewhohave killed him;and forhimself at
Saahemakes the sacrifice toto 'akalo(page 137),toclear
away anydangerthatmayhappentohim asthecause of
death. IntheBanks' Islands andNorthern New Hebrides
thetreatment ofadulteryisvery simple ;theman isshot or
clubbed bythehusband orhisfriends intheir firstindig-
nation, andthewoman isbeaten, scolded, andthreatened with
death, butthematter iscompromised very generally by
