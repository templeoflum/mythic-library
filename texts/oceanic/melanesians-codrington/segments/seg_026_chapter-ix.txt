PRAYERS.
AMELANESIAN native indanger, difficulty and distress, will
naturallycalluponthebeingsinwhose powertohelphimhe
believes. Hewilluponoccasion dothiswith exclamations
whichexpresshisfeelings.This from hispointofview
would notbeprayer,because ithasnoformal character.
There are alsosongs, incantations, charms, which have
powerinthembyvirtue ofthenames orwords contained in
them. These arenotaddresseddirectlytothebeings whose
power they bringtobear,andwould notbecalledprayers.
There arebesides invocations which maybecalledprayers,
that isformal addresses tobegforsuccour orforaid.But it
iscertainly very difficult, ifnotimpossible,tofind inany
Melanesian languageaword whichdirectlytranslates the
wordprayer,socloselydoesthenotion ofefficacy clingto"

intheSolomon Islands areofcourse made tothebeingsto
whomtheylookthere forother thanhuman aid,tothetindalo,
ghosts nowpowerfulofmen deceased. The invocations used
atsacrifices areprayers ;andthosemayproperlybesocalled
which areused atsea.Thus atFlorida toDaula, atindalo
generally known andconnected with thefrigate-bird:'Do
thoudraw thecanoe, that itmay reach theland;speedmy
canoe, grandfather, that Imayquicklyreach theshore whither
Iambound. Dothou, Daula, lightenthecanoe, that itmay

orisrepresented byone,beingcalled Bagea. Theycallalso
upontheir immediate forefathers when indanger onthe
sea;oneonhisgrandfather,another onhisfather, another
onsome dead friend;calling them with reverence, and
saying,'Save usonthedeep,save usfrom thetempest,
bringustothe shore.' Daula isinvoked toaidinfishing:
'Ifthou artpowerful, mana,ODaula, putafish ortwo
into thisnetand letthem diethere.' After agoodcatch
heispraised:'Powerful, mana,isthe tindalo ofthe net.'
Theyrubfishing-lineswith theleavesappropriatedtosuch a
tindalo. InSanCristoval the'ataroghostsareappliedtofor
helpinbattle, insickness, and forgood crops ;butlihungai,
theword they use,conveysrather thenotion ofcharm than of
prayer;theformula ishanded down from father toson,oris
taughtforaconsideration. SoatSaaamanwhohasno
specialconnexion with alidaghost will, indangeratsea,

inwhich power over theelements resides, andwhen hehas
done that, callsonthemannowdeadwho introduced himto
thelioaandtaught himtheincantation, andafter thatagain
uponhisfather andhisgrandfather.
The tataro oftheBanks' Islands, which maybecalled a
prayer,isstrictlyaninvocation ofthedead,and isnodoubt
socalled because theform begins with thewordtataro, which
certainlyisthe 'ataro ofSan Cristoval, that isaghost of
power. TheBanks' islanders areclear that tataro isproperly
madeonlytothedead;yetthespirits,vui,QatandMarawa
areaddressed inthesame way.Aman indanger onthesea

that these latter which follow, notbeingaddressed tothe
