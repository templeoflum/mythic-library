IThasbeenmyendeavour inthefollowing pagesto
bring togethertheresults ofsuch observations asmany
years' acquaintance with Melanesianpeoplehasenabled
metomake. Ihadoncehopedtohave been able togive
something more likeafullaccount ofthe beliefs and
practicesofthenatives ofthose islands concerning which
Ihavehadtheopportunityofcollectinginformation;but
mystayuponmylastreturn totheMelanesian Mission
wastooshort forthis,andIhavenow toputforthwhat I
know tobevery incomplete.
Myobservations andenquiries were carried on,andmy
notes were made, intheyears from1863, when Ifirst
visited theislands, to1887,when IlefttheMission;partly
intheMelanesian Islands, butmostlyinNorfolk Island,
where natives ofmanyofthese islands have formany
years beenbrought togetherforinstruction. Twiceduring
thisperiodImade with natives ofthevarious islands a
systematic enquiryintothereligiousbeliefs andpracticesof
theMelanesians, andthesocial regulations andconditions
prevailing amongthem. Onthefirstoccasion Ihad, asre-
gards theBanks' Islands, theveryvaluable assistance ofa
native whowasagrown youthbefore hispeople hadbeen
atallaffected byintercourse withEuropeansorhadheard
anyChristianteachingtheRev.George Sarawia, thefirst,


vi Preface.
andnow formany yearstheleader, ofthenativeclergyof
thatgroup.The results ofthese firstenquiries appeared
brieflyintheJournal oftheAnthropologicalInstitute of
February,1881;andthese werecarefully reviewed byme
duringmylaststayinNorfolk Island in1866and1867.
Iwassofortunate then astomeet there several oldfriends
andpupilswhohadcome down, fortheir health's sakeand
forother reasons, after aresidence asteachers amongtheir
ownpeople. Theyhadbeenlivingintheir various islands
inapositionandatanagewhich would make them ac-
quaintedwith theviews andhabits oftheir countrymen,
andtheywere able, and, Ibelieve, entirely willing,tocom-
municatefreely whattheyknew. Ithappenedthus that I
wasable togothroughthesubjects which aretreated ofin
thisbookwith native instructors fromtheSolomon Islands,
theBanks' Islands, andtheNorthern NewHebrides;with
Marsden Manekalea from Ysabel, Benjamin Bele from
Florida, Joseph Wate from Saa,Walter Woser from Motlav,
Arthur Arudulewari from Aurora, Lewis Tariliu from
Pentecost, Martin Tangabe fromLepers'Island;every one
ofthem, inmyopinion,acompetent andtrustworthy witness,
thoughallwere notequally intelligent.
Ithasbeenmypurposetosetforth asmuch aspossible
what nativessayabout themselves, notwhat Europeans
sayabout them. Forthisreason, thoughtheresults ofmy
ownpersonalobservations aregiven,Ihave refrained from
askingorrecording, exceptinafew instances where
acknowledgmentismade, theinformation whichmy
colleaguesintheMission would have abundantly and
willingly imparted. Noonecanbemore sensible than
myselfoftheincompleteness andinsufficiencyofwhat I
venture topublish ;Iknow that Imust havemademany
mistakes andmissed much that Imight have learnt. I
have feltthetruth ofwhat Mr.Fison, latemissionaryin


Preface.vii
Fiji,towhom Iamindebted formuch instruction, has
written :*When aEuropeanhasbeenlivingfortwo or
threeyearsamong savagesheissure tobefully convinced
thatheknows allabout them;when hehasbeen tenyears
orsoamongst them,ifhebeanobservant man, hefinds
thatheknows verylittle about them, and sobeginsto
learn.' Myowntime oflearninghasbeen alltooshort.
Ihaveendeavoured asfaraspossibletogivethenatives'
account ofthemselves bygiving what Itookdown from
theirlipsandtranslating whattheywrote themselves. It
islikelythatunder thecircumstances ofsuchenquiries
much oftheworst sideofnative lifemaybeoutofsight,
andtheview given seemgenerally more favourable than
mightbeexpected;ifitbeso,Ishall notregretit.
Ishould havebeengladifspace hadallowed metotreat
atgreater lengththesubjectofthenative Arts ofLife,and
tohavegiven more oftheTales, which throw somuch
lightuponnative lifeandthought. Thecomparisonofthe
Melanesianlanguages, customs, beliefs, and arts,with those
oftheislands ofthePacific andIndian Oceans, will fixthe
ethnological place oftheMelanesianpeople while itaids
thegeneral studyofmankind.
Inconclusion, thisbook, thoughwritten byamissionary,
with his fullshare oftheprejudices andpredilections
belongingtomissionaries,isnotmeant tohavewhat is
generallyunderstood tobeamissionarycharacter;butthe
writer ispersuadedthatoneofthe first duties ofamis-

CHAPTER I.
INTEODUCTORY.
THERE arefourgroupsofislands, within thatregionofthe
Western Pacific towhich thename ofMelanesia hasbeen
given,thatform acurved beltfollowing roughlytheoutline
oftheAustralian coast, atageneraldistance ofsome fifteen
hundred miles, andturning awayfrom theimportant outlying
ArchipelagoofFiji;these aretheSolomon Islands, the
Santa Cruzgroup,theBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides,
andNew Caledonia with theLoyaltyIslands. There is
anundoubted connexion ofrace, languageand customs
amongthepeople who inhabit these groups;aconnexion
which further extends itselfthroughoutwhat iscalled
Melanesia toNewGuinea westwards, andeastwards toFiji.
Thedistinction between theMelanesianpeopleofthese groups
andthePolynesianseastwards ofFijiisclearly marked and
recognised,forthe linewhichseparatesMelanesian from
PolynesianfallsbetweenFijiandTonga. Nosuch linecan
bedrawn tomark such aboundarytothewest tillthe
Asiatic continent itself isreached. From thePolynesian?
islands oftheEast Pacific ontheone side,andfrom the
Asiatic islands oftheMalay Archipelagoonthe other,
twocurrents ofinfluence have poured andarepouringinto
Melanesia, theformer much more modern and direct, the
^latter ancient andbroken initscourse. Uponthese currents
floatrespectively thekava rootandthebetel-nut.. Theuse
ofthebetel iscommon toIndia, China, andtheMelanesian
islands asfartotheeast asTikopia;thePolynesian kavai
hasestablished itself intheNew Hebrides, and isanovelty
insome oftheBanks' Islands;ithasnotbeen carried across
B


2Introductory. [CH.
theboundaryofthebetel-nut bythePolynesiansettlers
intheReef Islands ofSanta Cruz. Thepresent work is
notconcerned atallwith one ofthefourgroupsabove
mentioned, that ofNew Caledonia andtheLoyalty Islands,
norwith thelargersouthern members oftheNew Hebrides
group;itsview isconfined, exceptforoccasional illustration,
totheSolomon Islands, Ysabel, Florida, Savo, Guadalcanal*,
Malanta, SanCristoval, Ulawa, totheSanta Cruzgroup,the
Banks' andTorres Islands, andthree ofthenorthern New
Hebrides, Aurora, Pentecost andLepers'Islands. Within this
field arecontained certain islands inhabited byPolynesian
colonists from theEastwho still retain their Polynesian
speech. Such areNupani, Pileni, Nukapu, andother reef
islands oftheSwallowgroup, where thephysicalcharacter-
istics ofthePolynesian people may possiblybetraced, but
certainlyarenotconspicuous, having been lostbymixture
withneighbouringMelanesians. InRennell Island andBellona
Island, southern members oftheSolomongroup,thepeople
arephysically Polynesian;aladfrom Bellona, whowas in
New Zealand with Bishop Patteson, was inname(TeKiu),
colour, tattoo, andspeech verymuch aMaori. Menfrom the
Polynesiansettlements onMaeandFate intheNew Hebrides
havefound thelanguageofOntongJava liketheirown.
Thediscoveryofthese islands wasprolonged through
three centuries, and carried onbySpanish, French and
English voyagers.TheSpaniards found theSolomon Islands,
Santa Cruz, theBanks' Islands, and thenorthern New
Hebrides;theFrench added much later tothediscoveries in
these groups;theEnglish found, underCaptain Cook, the
principalislands oftheNew Hebrides andNewCaledonia,
andhave filled inthecharts. TheDutch discoveredFiji.
The earliest, andcertainly mostinteresting,discoveries were
those oftheSpaniards ;ofMendana inhistwovoyages
of1567 and1595, and ofQuiros andTorres in1606l
.
1Dr.Guppy,inhisSolomon Islands andtheir Natives, hasdiscussed these
discoveries atlength withspecial reference totheJournal ofGallego. Bythe
kindness ofMr.Woodford Ihave read thenarrative ofCotoira. Inboth the


i.]Discoveries. 3
Mendana, despatched bytheViceroyofPeru, reached in
1567the firstMelanesian land seenbyEuropeans,thegreat
island which henamed Santa Ysabel delaEstrella, andfrom
thence thevoyagersunder hiscommand discovered further
andnamed thelargeislands Malaita, Guadalcanal, San
Crist-oval, andthe lesser islands, Sesarga, which isSavo,
Florida with itsislets, Ulawa, andthesmall islands near
San Cristoval. Tothese hegavethename oftheSolomon
Islands, tomark hisconjecture,ortosuggestthe belief, that
hehaddiscovered thesource oftheriches ofSolomon. In
hissecond voyageof1595, undertaken forthepurposeof
colonizingtheSolomon Islands, Mendana discovered Santa
Cruz, andattemptedtoform asettlement there;anattempt
abandoned aftertwomonths, inconsequenceofhisdeath and
thesickness oftheremnant ofhiscrews. Quiros hadbeen
with Mendana, andwas allowed in1606 tocarry outa
project hehadbeen continually urgingofrecovering and
colonizingtheSolomon group.Fortune however madehim
thediscoverer oftheNew Hebrides, when hebelieved himself
tohave reached thegreatAustral Continent, intheisland
which still bears thename hegaveitofEspirituSanto.
The firstMelanesian islands however thathesawwere those
nowknown astheBanks' Islands, oneofwhich, Santa Maria,
retains thename hegaveit :Torres, afterpartingfrom Quiros,
sawandnamed theTorres Islands. After aninterval ofmore
than acentury andahalf,theFrench voyager Bougainville,
in1768, added Pentecost, Lepers' Island, andMalikolo tothe
discoveryofQuiros, naming thegrouptheGreat Cyclades,
andfound thegreatislands ofChoiseul andBougainville
beyondthose discovered inthe firstvoyageofMendana.
Polynesian wordTeAriki, theChief, intheform Taurique,isgivenasthe
designation ofthechiefs inYsabel, where itisnow entirelyoutofplace.This
isthelesseasyofexplanation,astheother native words given appeartobe
thosenow inuse. ImayaddthatIhave discussed theaccounts ofMendana's
discoveries, asrelated inBurney's andDalrymple's collections, with natives of
theSolomon andSanta Cruz Islands;butunfortunately mynotes onthis
subject havebeen lost.

InthenextyearSurvillepassed throughthesame group;
thedisastrous voyageofLaPerouse ended atVanikoro in
1785. Thesouthern islands ofthegroup, which have since
preservedthename hegaveoftheNew Hebrides, were
discovered byCook inhissecond great voyagein1774, and
after theseNew Caledonia andtheLoyaltyIslands.Bligh,in
hiswonderful boatvoyageafter themutinyoftheBounty,
passed throughandnamed theislands oftheBanks'group.
Thenames given bytheSpaniardstotheSolomon andSanta
Cruzgroups,andtotheislands ofYsabel, Florida, Guadal-
canar, San Cristoval, Santa Anna andSanta Catalina, to
EspirituSanto intheNew Hebrides andSanta Maria inthe
Banks' Islands, have maintained themselves; some ofthe
French names have disappeared ;some, Aurora, Pentecost or
Whitsuntide, Star Island, Gulf Island(forUgi),have taken
anEnglishform. Tosome islands nonewnames havebeen
given,native names, orwhatweresupposedtobesuch,having
beensupplied bythenatives, such asAmbry m,Api,Mallicollo;
insome cases thenative name, orwhatwastaken forit,as
Malaita, hasprevailedoverthenamegiven bythediscoverer.
Toascertain thenative name, andtheproper orthographyof

notbynatives, from thename ofapartofit.Avillageonthat island
ismarked ontheAdmiraltychart with thename ofitschief. The island
ofFlorida and itslanguagehasgotthename ofAnutha. andAnudha,

1862, wasgiven byanative boyonboard thename, intheformAnudha,

whocould notpronouncethcalled itAnuta;Banks' Islanders, taking the

areoften taken todesignatethewhole;thesecond ofthese,
sofarasisknown tothem, iscalled Gerabynatives ofsouth-
eastMalanta andSanCristoval;andthelatter hasbecome
known asBauro, from itsmost conspicuous part.Itisstrange
that thelargeisland which hassomehowgotthename of
Malanta hasanative name, atanyrate allalongthewest side,
Mala orMara. Thenative name ofFlorida isNggela,the
sameword asGera;andtheisland isknown inMala Masiki
as*beyondGela.' Savo isnodoubt theisland calledSesarga
bytheSpaniards, whoheard thename Sabo, andmisplaced
it.The native Ulawa, heard bytheSpaniardsasUraba,
has losttheSpanish name ofLaTreguada, and retains
onthecharts Surville's Contrariete. The native name of
Santa Cruz, thediscoveryofMendana's secondvoyage,is
Ndeni, fromwhich theNitendi ofthecharts hasprobably
been derived \
ThediscoveryoftheBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides by
Quiros waspreceded byavisit toTaumako, where heobtained

native name ofMarina. Thiswasnotthe firstlandofthe

Shortlybefore thisacanoe fromTikopia hadbeen driven bythewind toMota,
andthemen inhermostkindly treated, andthesamething hadhappened
before andhashappened since. The difference insize,manner, language and
dressbetween theTikopians andBanks' Islanders wasconspicuous. Thetrue
name ispretty certainly Chikopia,since theMotapeoplelearntSikopia from
their visitors;twoFijianislands areCikobia =Thikombia.

found thattheEeef Islanders ofSanta Cruz visited Taumako andTikopia.It
isexcusable atsighttotake thePouro ofQuiros forBauro inSanCristoval,
but inmyopinion theattemptedidentification mustcompletelyfail. In
the firstplace, Pouro andBauro arefarfrombeingthesame insoundwhen the
confusion ofEnglish spellingisgotridof;Quiros would never write ouforau.
Secondly, Bauro isnotandnever wasthenative name ofSanCristoval;itis

andadoptedforEuropean convenience. Gallego calls, andproperly,apart

;Omba withthesame

therefore towriteRagaaswell asOmba, butcustom inthese
matters must beallowed toprevail. The interest ofthe
pointliesintheconnexion shewn bythecommon useof
thisprepositioninplace-namesbetween Melanesia, theMalay
ArchipelagoandMadagascar. Ethnological and historical
questionsareinseparablefrom theconsideration ofplace-
names;forexample,thequestions whether theBauro of
theSolomon Islands isthesame with theBouro, properly
Buru, near theMoluccas, orwhether Futuna oftheNew
Hebrides isnamed after Futuna, Home's Island. About one
thing however there oughttobenodisagreement; however
difficult itmaybetoascertain anative name and itsortho-
graphy, European names should bewritten inthelanguage
towhich they belong;San Cristoval, orCristobal, not
Christoval;Espiritu Santo, notSpirito Santo orSt.Esprit;
andwhere French names areretained, Contrariete Island and
CapeZelee.
Between thetime ofthediscoveryoftheSolomon Islands
byMendana andthetime inwhich the visits ofwhalers,
traders andmissionaries have becomefrequent, within the
lastthirtyorforty years, verylittle ifanythingatallwas
donebyEuropeanstoinfluence thecharacter ofnative life.
Itisveryinterestingtherefore toenquireinwhatparticulars
theSpaniards' account ofwhatthey discovered differs from
what would berecorded byrecent visitors. Theplace-names
mentioned, with lesserror than iscommon now, arethose still
inuse,Malaita forMala, Uraba forUlawa, Paubro forBauro,
AguareforOwarii. Thenames ofpersons mentioned aresuch
asarenow inuse;oneofthefewwords notnames to

exceptatSanCristoval, where darts arementioned;inrecent
times avoyagerwould nothave found bows and arrows

reports opencannibalism atYsabel and Florida, whereas

forlapsesofmemoryononesideandexaggerationoffacton
theother, thepeople, language,customs andcondition ofthe
peopleintheSolomon Islands have notchangedsince
Mendana'sdiscoveryof1567I
.
Theaccount ofthe visit ofMendana toSanta Cruz in
1595and oftheSpanish attempttoform asettlement is
ample anddetailed;and itwasremarked byBishop Patteson,
whowasprobablythefirstEuropeanafterMendana'spartyto
goabout thenativevillages,thatwhat heobserved corre-
sponded closely withtheSpanishrecord. Itisonlywithin the
lasttenyears that,bythecourageandenterpriseofthepresent
Missionary Bishop John Selwyn,theisland ofSanta Cruzhas
again become opentofriendly,andunhappilyalso tomis-
chievous, approach. Thepresentwriter hasgone through
theaccount ofMendana's visitwith natives ofSanta Cruz,
whose comments werecertainly interesting. Onepointmay
bementioned;theSpaniards, failingtogetthepeopleofthe
main island tolearn theirlanguage,sent tokidnap,after
thefashion which from thebeginning seems tohave been
natural toEuropean visitors, some boysfromtheneighbouring
Reef Islands, whomtheyhadobserved tobemoreintelligent
1Mr.Woodford, inFurther Explorations intheSolomon Islands, has
brought forward information from theJournal ofCatoira, chiefpurserof
Mendana's fleet. From this itappears that theuseofthebetel-nut was
already established. Another native word, nambolo, apig,also occurs.
Much maybelearnt astothepresent condition oftheSolomon Islanders

than those ofSanta Cruz. When thiswas related toa
mixed groupofSanta Cruz andReef IslandboysatNorfolk
Island, itwasatonce declared thattheSpaniards werequite
right,thattheSanta Cruzpeople nowthink theKeefIslandboys
sharperthan theirown;because itisthecustom oftheir
fathers totakethem withthem ontheirvoyages, which
Santa Cruzmen donot do.Theveryshortstayofthe
Spaniards,soonassuminghostile relations, cannot bethought
tohave affected native lifeatall;thelooms with which
theyweave their mats, their fowls,common tilllatelytoother
islands with them, andmanyotherthingsinwhich a
difference hasbeen observed, arementioned intheSpanish
narrative. There isnothingintheaccount ofthediscoveries
ofQuiros intheBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides toshew
anydifference between thecondition ofthenativepeople
then and inthelater times, whentheyhavebecome well
known toEuropeans;but itmaybeobserved that the
Spaniards begantokidnap,doubtless withgood intentions,
andtorecognise the'devil'ofthenatives.
Intheinterval between thediscoveries ofMendana and
Quiros andthe visits ofwhalers andmissionaries inthe
present century,there iseveryreason tobelieve that all
memory and tradition ofwhite menhaddiedawayinthe
Solomon Islands andSanta Cruzl
;Europeans appeared again
asperfect strangers. Weareable therefore toconjecture
howthe firstexplorers appearedtothenatives, whenweknow
howwehave ourselvesappeared. Totheoldvoyagers,as
1Bishop SelwynofNew Zealand beganhismissionary voyagesin1849,
andvisited theSolomon Islands in1850 ;helanded onsixtyislands in1857,
inwhichyeartheBanks' Islands became wellknown tohim. In1861Bishop
Patteson,inH.M.S.Cordelia, became acquaintedwith Florida andYsabel,
theyearlyvisits oftheMelanesian Missionhavingbeforestoppedshort at
Guadalcanar. From thatyear forward thework oftheMission hasbeen
regularlycarried onwithin thelimits ofYsabel tothewest, andMae,
later Pentecost, tothesouth. When thepresentwriter made hisfirstvoyage
intheMissionvessel, theSouthern Cross, in1863, Bishop Patteson was
generally conversant with thepeople andthelanguagesoftheislands from
NewZealand toYsabel.

tolater discoverers, itwasamatter ofcourse thathitherto
unknown countries should befound, andthattheyshould be
inhabited bymen unlike themselves;buttothenatives
itwasastrange thing-that there should beanymen unlike
themselves, oranyunknown land forthem tocome from.
There arestillnatives inthese islands whoremember when a
whitemanwas first seen,andwhat hewastaken tobe.In
theBanks' Islands, forexample,thenatives believed theworld
toconsist oftheirowngroup, withtheTorres Islands, thethree
orfournorthern New Hebrides, andperhaps Tikopia, round
which theoceanspreadtillitwasshut inbythefoundations
ofthesky. The first vessels theyremember tohave seen
were whalers, which theydidnotbelieve tocome fromany
countryintheworld;theywere indeedquitesurethatthey
didnot,butmust have beenmade outatsea,because they
knew thatnomen intheworld hadsuch vessels. Inthe
samewaytheywere surethatthevoyagerswerenotmen;if
they were theywould beblack. What were theythen?
Theywere ghosts, andbeing ghosts,ofnecessitythose ofmen
whohadlived intheworld. When Mr.Patteson firstlanded
atMota, theMissionparty havingbeen seen intheprevious
yearatVanua Lava, there wasadivision ofopinion among
thenatives;some saidthatthebrothers ofQathadreturned,
certainsupernatural beingsofwhom stories aretold;others
maintained thattheywereghosts.Mr.Patteson retired from
theheatandcrowd intoanempty house, theowner ofwhich
hadlatelydied;this settled thequestion,hewastheghost
ofthelatehouseholder, andknew hishome.Averyshort
acquaintancewith white visitors shews that theyarenot
ghosts,butcertainlydoes notshew that theyaremen;
theconjecturethen isthattheyarebeingsofanother order,
spiritsordemons, powerful nodoubt, butmischievous. A
ghostwould bereceived inapeacefulandrespectful manner,
asEuropeanvisitors have alwaysinthe first instance been
received;abeingnotaliving man orghosthaswonderful

eldermen saidthatthese strange beings wouldbring- nothing

toshootingatthem, theywerenotmen.andthearrows could

theeldermen have, from theirownpointofview atleast,
beenright;iron, tobacco, calico, awider knowledgeofthe
world, have notcompensatednativepeoplefornew diseases
andtheweakeningofsocial bonds1
.White visitors have not
meant todothenatives wrong,buttheyhave infactharmed
them, andhavenotearned moralrespectatanyrategenerally
from them. Europeans have from thebeginningofinter-
course with Melanesian natives kidnapped them, andhave
persuaded themselves thatthey were doing them aservice
bybringing them intowhat iscalled contact with civilization;
thenatives havefromthefirstresented thekidnappingoftheir
sons,and theirsons,however much theymayhavewished to
goaway andhaverejoicedinwhat they have learnt and

somepeople thepowerofspeakingalittle'pigeon English,'for

Toavoyager among these Melanesian islands who has

tillnatives returned from residence withEuropeans. When theNukapu
men, whosekidnapping wastheimmediate cause ofthedeath ofBishop
Patteson, escaped fromFijiandmade theirwaytotheir nativeisland,
dysentery, before unknown, broke outthere. Theabsence ofanative name
forthisandother diseases, istosome extent atleast aproofofrecent in-
troduction. Within myown recollectionsyphilis,orthevenereal disease
which wastaken forit,wasunknown intheislands visited bytheMela-
nesian Mission, except atSanCristoval, where alone intercourse with whalers
and traders hadbeen considerable. Ithaslately becomewidely known,

THERE willbenoattempt made here todealwith the
EthnologyofMelanesia. TheoriginoftheMelanesian
people,intheir various seats and intheir various divisions,

the stories whichpassamong themrepresentthemselves to
have been created where theyare.Thevarietyoftheir
languages,and toamuch lessextent oftheir artsand

guagesdiscovers averyconsiderableunderlying sameness;
andthepresent bookmaybetakenperhapsasanevidence
ofalarge generalresemblance inthereligiousbeliefs and
practices,thecustoms andwaysoflife,whichprevailinthe
islands which arehereembraced inacommon view. As
knowledgeextends and detailed information isbroughtin
from allsides, aconnexion willnodoubt betraced with

consequencetoobserve themeaningofthewords bywhich
thepeopleofthevarious islands describe themselves asmen.
Itissaidsometimes thatpeoplediscovered inisolation from
others callthemselvesmerely'men,' without aname fortheir

theworld. InMelanesia, when natives were firstaskedwho
they were, theyanswered*men,' meaningthattheywerenot
demons orghosts,butliving men
;andtheydidsobecause
theydidnotbelieve their visitors tobemen,butghoststhem-
selves, ordemons, orspirits belongingtothesea.
Inthenative view ofmankind, almost everywhereinthe
islands which arehere under consideration, nothingseems
more fundamental than thedivision ofthepeopleintotwoor
more classes, which areexogamous, and inwhich descent is
countedthroughthemother. Thisseems tostand foremost

There is,however, onevery remarkable exceptiontothis

Malanta, andGuadalcanar, adistrict inwhich thelanguages
alsoform agroup bythemselves, andinwhich adifference in
thedecorative artofthepeople,andintheappearanceofthe
people themselves, thoroughly Melanesian asthey are,can
hardly escapenotice. Inthisregion,theboundaries ofwhich
areatpresent unknown, there isnodivision ofthepeopleinto
kindreds aselsewhere, anddescent follows thefather. This is
sostrangethat tomyselfitseemed foratime incredible, and
nothingbuttherepeateddeclarations ofanative who iswell

ofislands, was sufficient tofixitwithmeasanascertained
fact. Theparticularorlocal causes which havebroughtabout
thisexceptionalstate ofthingsareunknown;thefactofthe
exceptionisavaluable onetonote *.
Speaking generally,itmaybesaidthat toaMelanesian
man allwomen, ofhisowngenerationatleast, areeither
sisters orwives, totheMelanesian woman allmen areeither
brothers orhusbands. Anexcellent illustration ofthis is
giveninthestoryofTasofromAurora intheNewHebrides,
inwhich Qatu discovers andbringstohiswifetwinboys,
children ofhisdead sister: hiswifeasks, 'Are thesemy
children ormyhusbands ?'andQatuanswers,'Yourhusbands
tobesure, theyaremysister's children.' Inthat island
there aretwodivisions ofthepeople;Qatuandhiswifecould
notbeofthesame, Qatuandhissister andherchildren must
beofthesame;theboystherefore were possible husbands of

Qatu's wife,buthadtheybelongedtotheother division their
agewould havemade hercountthem herchildren rather than
herbrothers. Itmust notbeunderstood that aMelanesian
regardsallwomen who arenotofhisown division asinfact
hiswives, orconceives himself tohaverights which hemay
exercise inregardtothosewomen ofthemwho areunmarried;
butthewomen whomaybehiswives bymarriage,andthose
whocannotpossiblybeso,stand inawidelydifferent relation
tohim;and itmaybeadded that allwomen whomaybecome

extent looked uponbythosewhomaybetheirhusbands asopen
toamore orlesslegitimateintercourse. Infactappropriation
ofparticular women totheirownhusbands, thoughestablished
byeverysanction ofnative custom, hasbynomeans sostrong
ahold innativesociety, norinallprobability anythinglike
sodeepafoundation inthehistoryofthenativepeople,as
theseverance ofeither sexbydivisions which moststrictly
limit theintercourse ofmenandwomen tothose ofthesection
orsections towhich they donotthemselvesbelong. Two
proofsorexemplificationsofthisareconspicuous, (i)There is
probablynoplaceinwhich thecommonopinionofMelanesians
approvestheintercourse ofunmarriedyouths andgirlsasa
thing goodinitself, thoughitallows itasathingtobe
expected andtobeexcused;butintercourse within thelimit
which restrains from marriage, where twomembers ofthe
same division areconcerned, isacrime,isincest. InFlorida
inoldtimes themanwould havebeen killed, andthewoman
made aharlot;nowthat theseverityofancient manners is
relaxed, money andpigscancondone the offence, butmuch
more than isexacted ifaman isfoundsinningwith onewho
might possibly havebecome hiswife. IntheBanks' Islands,
where thedivisions ofthepeoplearetwo,ifitbecame known
thattwomembers ofoneofthemhadbeenguiltyofthis dis-

withwhom hehadoffended, soastoappeasetheiranger,and
'fence against'thefault. Cases ofincest ofthiskind were
alwaysrareinalltheislands, sostrongwasthefeeling against
intercourse within thekin.(2)Thefeeling ontheotherhand
thattheintercourse ofthesexes wasnatural where theman
andwoman belongedtodifferent divisions, wasshewn bythat
feature ofnative hospitalitywhich providedaguestwith a
temporarywife. That this isdonenow orhaslatelybeen
done isreadilydenied intheSolomon andBanks' Islands, but
isnotdenied intheNorthern New Hebrides;there canbe
little doubt that itwascommon everywhere.Butthewoman

Itwillbeconvenient inthemoreparticulartreatment of
thissubject,totakeexamplesfirstfromtheBanks' Islands and
Northern New Hebrides, where thepeoplearedivided intotwo
kins,andthenfrom theSolomon Islands, where thedivisions
aremore than two. Thesametwodivisions runthroughthe

Awoman whomarries doesnotcome over toherhusband's

husband goover tothewife's side;thechildrenbelongto

oneanother. Hence aman's children arenot hissogoi,his
kindred;hisnearest relations arehissister's children. There
isnoaccountseriously givenoftheoriginofthetwodivisions
intheBanks' Islands. Within thetwovevethere arecertain
families amongtheBanks' Islandpeople,themembers of
which have acertainfamily pride,andendeavour tokeepup
byintermarriagethefamilyconnexion. Thebestknown of
these istheLoSepere family,from theplaceofthatname in
Vanua Lava, where Qat isbelieved tohave lived *.Adoption
iscommon, andhasnoparticular significance.Childless
parents naturally adoptachild ofkintothewife, sothatthe

but if,assometimeshappens, anorphanchild from the

When thechildgrows upandbysome chance finds outthat

willleave hisfosterparents, andgoand livewith hisown

covery.

theyhave astorythat the firstwoman, acowryshell that

uncles, accordingtothepresent arrangements. Thepresence
offamilies within thekininthisisland isveryremarkable.
There areseveral inthenorthernpartoftheisland, mostly
named from theplaceswhere theyareformed. There isone,
however, named from theoctopus, wirita, belonging originally
toBugita,aplaceupontheshore. Theconnexion between

thenplenty would betaken. Itseems rather asthoughthe
residence ofthisfamily where wirita areabundant, andwhere
thebeach wouldnaturally betheirpreserveforfishing, had

family named'AttheWotaga,' from theirhome near a

Incaseoftheadoptionofachildbyafoster-mother who isof

thetrue state ofthecase isnever mentioned bythosewho

ofconsideration forthefeelingsoftheadopting parents ;but
therepugnancetomarriagewithin thekin istoogreatto
allow ofpermanent concealment.
Thesystemofthedivision ofthepeopleintostrictly
exogamouskins isnodoubt bestseenandconsidered where
thedivision issimple andseparatesthewholepopulation on
theone'sideofthehouse'andtheother. Twoquestions
mayhere therefore besuitably raised; thefirst,whether in
thisdivision there aretraces ofacommunal systemofmarriage;
thesecond, whether thesystemissufficient topreventthat
which itseems intended ormaintained inorder toprevent,
namely, themarriageofpersonstoocloselyallied inblood.
Inregardtothe firstquestionitmust besaid,ontheone
hand, thatthepeople havenomemoryofatimewhen allthe
women ofonesidewere infactcommon wives tothemen of
theotherside,andthat there isnooccasion onwhich the
women become common tothemenwho arenotoftheir

When Qatwove IroLeiwithpliantrodsandmade herlive,it

said tobestealing her,notclaimingaright. When he

wife.Ontheother side istobesetthetestimony,thestrong
testimony,ofwords. This isgiven bytheplural form in
which theterms for'mother'and'husband'or'wife'are
expressed.IntheMota languagetheform isveryclear;
raistheplural prefix;thedivision, side, orkin, isthe veve,
andmother israveve;soai isamember, asofabody,ora
component partofahouse orofatree,andrasoai iseither

forbidden bythe fullconsciousness ofthenatives themselves
that itexpresses plurality. Thekin isthe veve, achild's
mother is'theyofthekin/ hiskindred. Aman's kindred
arenotcalled hisvevebecausetheyarehismother'speople;
she iscalled hisveve, intheplural,hiskindred, asifshewere
therepresentativeofthekin;asifhewere notthechild of
theparticular woman whoborehim,butofthewhole kindred
forwhom shebrought himintotheworld. Byaparalleluse
tothisaplural form isgiventotheMota word forchild,
reremera, with adoubledplural sign ;asingle boyiscalled not
'child'but'children,' asifhisindividuality were not dis-
tinguished from thecommonoffspringofhisveve. Thesame
plural prefixisfound inother Banks' Island wordsmeaning
mother;rave inSanta Maria, retne inVanua Lava, reme in
Torres Islands. Themother iscalled ratahi inWr
hitsuntide,
andrataJngiinLepers' Island, that isthesisters, thesisterhood,
because sherepresents thesister members ofthewaivung who

word used forhusband orwifehastheplural form. InMota
aman doesnot callhiswife amember ofhim, acomponent
partofhim,buthismembers, hiscomponent parts ;andsoa
wifespeaksofherhusband. Itisnotthatthemanandhis
wifemake upacomposite bodybetween them, butthatthe

compositemarriedbody. TheMotapeople know that the
word theyusemeans this;itwasowned tomyselfwith a
blush that itwas so,with aMelanesian blush, andaprotesta-
tionthattheword didnotrepresentafact. Theword used
inMotlav, partofSaddle Island, gives hardlythe lesscon-
firmation tothisinterpretationoftheMota word because it
hasnotaplural form;inMotlav ignige hasthesamemeaning1
with theMota soai;amansaysofhislegorhisarmignik,

ignik,while shecallshimthesame.
Asconcerns thesecondpointinquestion,itisapparentthat
thestrict ruleofexogamyasregardsthekinleavesmarriage
opentothosewho areverynearinblood;foraman isnotof
kin tohisown children, andaman isnotofkintohis
brother's children. Butalthoughitistheintermarriageof
sogoi, members ofthesame veve, that isstrictly forbidden,
andthedescent isalwayscounted bythemother, yetthe
blood connexion with thefather andthefather's near relations
isnever outofsight. Consequentlythemarriageofthose
who arenear inblood, though theyarenotsogoiandmay
lawfully marry,isdiscountenanced. InMota, forexample,
thechildren ofabrother and sister arethoughttoonear to
marry. Thebrother and sister areboth ofone veve, A,as
children ofonemother;thechildren ofthe sister areofher
veve,A;thebrother's children areoftheveve B,following
their mother, whomust needs beoftheother side ofthe
house. Itappears then thatthetwo cousins, children ofa
brother and sister, arenotsogoi, onebeingAandtheother B,
andthattheycanmarry.Buttheywillnot;thematch
willnotbemade;iftheymarried theywould besaid to'go

recognitionofagnaticdescent.

kema areknown tohave come. TheNggaombata andthe
Himbo, perhaps onlyasstrangers, gotogether;andtheLahi,
asmall division, aresaidtobesoclosely connected withHimbo
thatthemembers cannotintermarry. Whether Honggokama
andManukama arenames ofonekema, oroftwo divisions
intowhich theone isseparating,isaquestion. TheHonggo-
kama andtheHonggo-kiki,thegreatandthelittle, areplainly
partsofoneoriginal.Itisnotthecase inFlorida thatan
originallydouble division hassimply splitandsplit again;
butthesettlement offoreignershas socomplicated the
arrangementthatfewnativesprofesstobeabletofollow it*.
Yettheforeigners have undoubtedly broughtwiththem a
distinct sense ofkinship withoneorother ofthelocal kema.
The strict rule ofexogamyisnotasufficient limit tothe
rightofmarriage ;here also, asintheeasternislands,itis
supplemented byastrong public opinionastowhat isright.Aremarkable instance ofthisoccurred afewyears ago,when
Takua, aconsiderable chief, took tohimself thedaughter
ofoneofhiswives. Thegirlwasnot,ofcourse, ofhisown

decency andproprietyofthepeople wasoutraged, andtheman's

that theoriginofthis restraint was recent andwell re-

Thesystem bywhich theMelanesianpeoplearethusdivided
intoexogamous groupsinwhich descent follows themother,
receives ofcourse thename ofaMatriarchalsystem ;but it
,must beunderstood thatthemother isinnowaythehead of
thefamily. Thehouse ofthefamilyisthe father's, the
gardenishis,theruleandgovernmentarehis;itisintothe
father's house that theyoung bridegroomtakes hiswife, if
hehasnotonereadyofhisown. The closestrelationship,
however, accordingtonative notions, isthatwhich exists
between thesister's sonandthemother'sbrother, because the
mother whotransmits thekinshipisnotable torender the
service which amancangive.Aman's sons arenotofhis
own kin,thoughheactsafather'sparttothem;butthetie
between hissister's children andhimself hasthestrengthof
thetraditional bond ofallnativesociety, that ofkinship
throughthemother. Theyouthashebeginstofeel social
wants, overandabove thefoodand shelter that hisfather
gives him, looks tohismother's brother asthemale re-
presentativeofhiskin. Itiswellknown that inFijithe
vasu, the sister's son, hasextraordinary rights with his
maternal uncle. Thecorresponding rightismuch lessqon-
spicuous andimportant than thisintheMelanesian Islands
west ofFiji ;but itisamatter ofcourse that thenephew
should look tohismother's brother forhelpofevery kind,
andthat theuncle should lookuponhis sister's sonashis
special care; thecloseness ofthis relation isfundamental.
Theconnexion ofkinship through themother with thegreat
exogamous group, andthatofbloodthrough thefather with
hisfamily, thus stand inclearrecognition, andtoacertain
extentnecessarily conflict onewith another. Theconnexion

Theterms therefore inwhich thevariousdegreesofrelation-

cannot indeed betaken toshew whateverywhere prevails,
butasgivingarepresentative exampleisveryvaluable;the

group, canperhapsbeshewncompletely andexactly.
(i)Ithasbeen saidthat allthemembers ofeach ofthetwo
exogamousdivisions ofthepeoplearesogoi, that isofkin,to
oneanother;theonlyother relation belongingtothiskinship
isthatbetween thematernal uncle andhissister's children,
maleandfemale, expressedintheterms maraui andvanangoi.
Theuncle ismaraui tohissister's child, thenepheworniece
isvanangoi tothemother's brother;butthenephewisalso
called maraui tohisuncle. The relationpasses ontothe
secondgeneration ;thechildren ofaman's sister'sdaughters

theterms ofrelationship would notundergo somechangein
such acase;whether,forexample,thesonsofthesame father

ismade.Aman's wives, ifheshould havemany,must allbe
soffoi,ofthesame sideofthehouse, calling oneanother sisters,
andcallingeachtheother's children hers,whethertheywere
married tothesameman orhad different husbands. This
does nothowever shut outaltogether therelationshipof
step-fatherandmother. Amanwhohasasonbyoneofhis
wiveswho isdead, doesnotbringinastep-mothertotheboy

come inasanother mother, andtheboywould takenonotice.
But ifawoman with children loses herhusband, andbecomes

ii.]Reserve andAvoidance. 43
singularreserve isstrongly shewn, asitisinFiji,bybrothers
and sisters, and alsobymothers andsons;butthis reserve,
thoughitsexistence and itscausemaywellthrowlightupon
that exercised between those connected bymarriage,hasno
proper placehere. InFlorida, intheSolomon Islands, there
isnodifficultyaboutmeeting,ormentioningthename of,
father- ormother-in-law, oranyofawife's kindred, andno
extraordinary marks ofrespectareshewn. Itisthesame at
Saa. The extraordinary separation ofthesexes inSanta
Cruzandtheneighbouring islands, however instructive to
observe inthis connexion, does notfollow onrelation by
marriage.IntheBanks' Islands therules ofavoidance and
reserve areverystrict andminute. Asregardstheavoidance
oftheperson,aman willnotcome near hiswife's mother;
theavoidance ismutual;ifthetwochance tomeet inapath,
thewoman willstepoutofitandstand with herback turned
tillhehasgone by,orperhapsifitbemore convenient he
willmove outoftheway. AtVanua Lava, inPort Patteson,
amanwould notfollow hismother-in-lawalongthebeach,
norshehim, until thetidehadwashed outthefootstepsofthe
first traveller from thesand. Atthesametime amanandhis
mother-in-law willtalkatadistance. Aman doesnotavoid
hisfather-in-law, norawoman hers.Aman doesnotavoid
hiswife's brother, butwillnotsleep withhim;hedoesnot
avoid hisson's wife, orhisown wife's sister. Boys andgirls
who areengaged generallyavoid oneanother, butthrough
shyness,notbyrule.Where thepersons above mentioned do
notavoid oneanother, theyarecareful toshewrespectinnot
J;aking_anythingfrom above thehead orsteppingover the

atalltimes forayoung man totakeanythingfrom above an
elder man's head, forthere issomething naturally sacred,

stepping overthelegsofanybutabrother orintimate friend.

buthewillname hiswife's sister, she isnothingtohim.A
woman will notname, butdoes notavoid, herhusband's
father;shewillonnoaccount name herdaughter'shusband.
Twopeople whose children have intermarried, who aregasala,
willnotname each other. The reserve withregardtothe
name extends totheuseofit,orofanypartofit,incommon
conversation. Amanononeoccasion spoketomeofhis

nearandwhispered,notthename ofhisson's wife,butthe
respectfulsubstitute forhername, amen Mulegona, shewho

Thus, referringtotheMotapedigree given onpage 38,Leve-

IThasbeenshewn that thesocial structure inthese Mela-

therefore thatthere canbenopoliticalstructure heldtogether

inmost islands important place andpower, thoughnever

persuasionthatsavage peoplearealwaysruledbychiefs.A
trader orother visitor looks forachief, andfinds such aone
asheexpects;avery insignificant personinthiswaycomes
tobecalled, andtocallhimself, thekingofhisisland, and
hisconsideration amonghisown peopleisofcourse enor-
mously enhanced bywhat whitepeople make ofhim. The
practice moreover ofthecommanders ofshipsofwarbywhich
local chiefs areheldresponsiblefortheconduct oftheirpeople,
andaretreated asiftheyhadconsiderablepower, undoubtedly
increases theirimportance, norcanthat result beregretted.
Asamatter offactthepowerofchiefs hashitherto rested
uponthebelief intheirsupernatural power derived fromthe

belief hasfailed, intheBanks' Islands forexample some time

IntheNorthern New Hebrides thepositionofachief is

thesonperhaps beingtooyoung,achiefs brother will

Walurigi,wasavery greatman;hesent hisson,ayoung

understood that aChristian education which shut outbelief

Ifthissonhadsettled inhisfather'svillagebefore theold
man's death, hewould nodoubt have succeeded tosome ofhis

When Mairuru diedwithout anapparent successor, acertain
man attemptedtotake hisplace ;hewent into the late
chief's sacred haunt, histauten, inwhich heused tohave his
intercourse with thewui, spirits, andhedeclared thathe
heard some onewhistle tohim there. Hetoldthepeople

CHAPTER IY.
PROPEETY ANDINHERITANCE.
INthecharacter ofproperty andinthelaws ofsuccession
toproperty,there ishardly anydifference tobefound inthe
Melanesian islands with which weareconcerned;inallit
maybesaidthatpropertyisinlandand inpersonal posses-
sions;that there isacertain distinction between landwhich
hasbeen inherited andthatwhich hasbeen reclaimed from
thewaste;that there isnostrictly communalpropertyin
land;andthatwith landed andpersonal property alike, the
original rightofsuccession iswith the sister's children,
except where, besides thevery exceptionalcase ofSaa, there
comes inthesuccession ofchildren totheproperty which
their father hasacquiredforhimself.
Thelandmaybeconsidered everywheretobedivided into
threeparts:(i)theTown lots;(2)theGarden ground ;_(g)
theBush. InFlorida, (i)NaKomu, (2)NaMatanga, (3)Na
Leiao;inSanta Cruz, (i)Natalia, (2)Nabalo, (3)Nabanogabo ;
inMota, (i) Vanua, (2) Utag, (3) Mot; inLepers'

butwhocanbynomeans alienate itasifitwere simply
hisown. The chiefs, however powerfulinsomeplaces they
may be,have nomorepropertyintheland ormoreright
over itinanyoftheislands than othermen;theyoften
usetheir power tyrannicallytodrive awaytheowners of
gardens whichthey covet, andtheyarevery willingtomeet
thecommon Europeanbelief that achief istheowner of
thesoil,bytakingapriceforlandwhich isnottheirs tosell;
buttheownershipofevery pieceisremembered andwillbe
asserted when occasion offers. Theremarkable case ofthe
landless chiefs atSaa(page 50)shews how fixed istheright
ofpropertyinland. Before thecomingofEuropeansthe
saleofland was, atleast atSaa,notunknown, butwas at
anyrateuncommon;oflate, especiallyintheNew Hebrides,
much land hasbeen sold toEuropeans, somehonestlyand
effectively, somebytransactions inwhich thetitleofthevendor
hasbeennothing buthiswillingnesstoreceive some calico
andguns. Inatrue saletheconsent ofallwhohavean
interest intheproperty must behad,andtheexactboundary
ofeachparcel ofland defined;then thevalue ofeachpiece
andofeach fruit-tree hastobeascertained, andtheclaim of
orforest. TheveiJcau iscommon toallmembers ofacommunity,buttheyavu
andtheqelearedivided andsubdivided. Each owner, however, holds forthe
household towhich hebelongs, thehousehold holds fortheclan, theclan for
thetribe, thetribe forthecommunity, andthecommunityforposterity. Each
generation hastheusufructonly,andcannot alienate theland. Thechiefs
have overridden this rule, butmostunjustly.' This will stand forthe
islands west ofFiji,with theimportant difference made bytheabsence of
tribes.

Itisremarkable indeed howpreciselyalike intheSolomon
Islands, theBanks' Islands, and theNew Hebrides, the
character ofpropertyinlandreclaimed from thebush asserts
itself tobe;andhowthesame effect hasbeenproducedof
introducingorstrengthening thetendency towards the

InFlorida thehouse sites intheJcomu, likethegardensof

CHAPTER V.
SECKET SOCIETIES ANDMYSTERIES.
THERE iscertainly nothing- more characteristic ofMelane-
sian lifethan thepresenceofSocieties which celebrate
Mysteries strictlyconcealed from theuninitiated andfrom all
females. Adress, with. amask orhat,disguisesthemembers
ifthey appearinopen day; theyhave strangecriesand
soundsbywhich theymake theirpresence known when
theyareunseen.'Insome cases, asinFlorida andAurora,
theymake apublic show ofapieceofthehandiwork ofthe
ghosts withwhom itispretendedthattheyhave been as-
sociating. Such societies aretheDukduk ofNew Britain
describedbyMr.Brown andMr.Komilly,theMatambala of
Florida, theTamate oftheBanks' Islands, theQatu ofthe
Northern New Hebrides. Aphotograph fromNew Caledonia
shews afigure which canhardlybedistinguished'from that
ofatamate from theBanks' Islands, andMr.Romillymentions
aninstitution liketheDukduk inNew Guinea. Itisplain,
therefore, that this institution extends very widely through
Melanesia, andtheNangaofFiji,thoughinsomerespects
different, cannot bethoughttobeentirelydistinct from it;
yetitisremarkable thatnothingofthesorthasasyetbeen
found inSanta Cruz, orintheSolomon Islands east of
Florida1

1Ofthetwolargeislands ofGuadalcanar andMalanta, onlyaverysmall
parthascome under observation. TheSanta Cruz peopledonotseem tobe
closely connected with theSolomon islanders. When itisremembered thatthe


Secret Societies andMysteries. [CH.
TheFlorida mysterieswere believed tohavebeen brought
from Ysabel, where nothingofthekind has asyetbeen
observed. This belief, how-
ever, serves topointtoa
connexion with theDukduk
ofNew Britain, inthename
ofwhich afurther connexion
mayprobablybefound. In
allthese societies theghosts
ofthedead were supposed
tobepresent;intheBanks'
Islands theirname is'The
Ghosts;'inSanta Cruz a
ghostisduka\ inFlorida
onemethod ofconsulting
theghostsofthedead is
paluduka.Itisvery likely
therefore that inNew
Britain theDukduk arealso
'The Ghosts.'
P~Oneveryimportant point
ofdifference separatesthese
from thebora ofAustralia,
inwhich thegrown youth
ofthetribe are'made young men,' andhave impartedto
them some knowledgeofthereligiousbeliefs andpractices
ofthe elders. Grown menand infants, married andun-
married, areequally admitted tothe societies ofFlorida
and theNew Hebrides;and ifintheBanks' Islands it
isnotcustomarytoadmitboys very young,there iscer-
tainly nolimit ofageasregardsadmission. Itisno

meet theexpenseofinitiation orofmatrimony ;hisfriends,
from carelessness orpoverty,have lethimgrow upwithout
making proper provisionforhim;heremains uninitiated and
unmarried from thesame cause;butinitiation isbynomeans
apreliminary steptomatrimony.Itisdifficult, inview of
the strictsecrecy andsolemnityofthemysteries, tobelieve
thatthere isnoknowledge impartedininitiation ofareligious
character. Theouter world ofwomen andchildren, andthe
uninitiated, matawonowono, whoseeyeswere closed, undoubt-
edlybelieved that theinitiated entered into association with
theghostsofthedead;thestranglecriesand awi'ul sounds
thatproceeded from thesacred andunapproachable lodgeof
theassociation, orfrom theforest when themembers ofit
were abroad, weremorethanhuman intheir ears;thefigures
thatappeared werenotthose ofmen.Anaccident would no
doubt sometimes make itplainthat itwasaman,some one
wellknown andrecognized, whowasfiguringasaghost ;
butthen hisdisguise wasnotthework ofmortal hands;and
theshrewdconjecturethat alltherestwere asmuchmenand
neighboursastheonewhose fallrevealed himmight be
entertained, butwould bedangeroustoexpress.Itwasonly
when theneophyte wasadmitted intothemysterious pre-
cincts thathefound onlyhisdaily companions there, and
learnt that there wasnothingtobeimpartedtohimexcept
theknowledge how thesounds wereproduced, how the
dresses anddecorations weremade, andinsome cases asong

andnosecret form ofworship practised. Theordinaryforms
ofprayerand sacrifice were performedaselsewhere, though
here inconnexion with thesemysteries.There werenoforms
ofworship peculiartothesociety, andnoobjectsofworship

Itisremarkable also that, asfarasIhave been able to
ascertain, there isnothingorverylittle that isobscene, or

Florida theinterval isconsiderable;butscholars from Florida,
ontheirwaytoNorfolk Island many years ago,recognized
theirown matabala inthesalagoro ofMota, towhich as
strangers they werefreelyadmitted. The result oftheir
admission was fatal tothemysteryineither institution. A
Floridaboywhohadseenwhat theMota salagoro wasand

their Florida schoolfellows what theyhad seen, andthe
sacredness ofthesalagoro was lost forthem. The secret was
outmany years ago,thoughinFlorida thepowerofthe
mysterieswasmaintained tillChristianity prevailedinthe

IntheBanks' Islands thetamate hassurvived theintroduction

.Intruth, the social powerofthese

inanarbitrary manner with the institutions ofthepeople, buttoleave
ittotheirown sense ofright andwrong, and theirownknowledge of
thecharacter ofwhat they did,tocondemn ortotolerate what their growing
enlightenment would callintoquestion. Sothere aroseamonghisearly pupils
thedoubt whether itwould berightforthem asChristians tocontinue members
ofthetamate societies, toseek foradmission intothem, andfrequent their

absence ofanystrong" political organizationtheimportance of
thepositionofamember ofthelargest andmost exclusive of

with theteachingofBishop Patteson, andwith theauthority
ofthegreatman oftheisland, thesocietyoftheGreat Tamate
hadforbidden theuseofthebowandarrow inprivate quarrels

whohadbeenguiltyoftheoffence hastened toatone forit
with apig,and allwasquiet again.Itisnotsurprisingthat

I.The Sanies' Islands. TheBanks' Islands, with the
neighbouringTorresgroup,areundoubtedlythechief seat of
thesesocieties, which arethereuniversallycalled'The Ghosts,'

having nopermanent lodgeorclub-house; this, theQat,
isfound inalltheBanks' Islands, butnotintheTorres

theytook itoutofthewoman's hands, made alodgefor

inMaewo, Omba, andAraga. InOmba, Lepers' Island, Iknow

intheshape ofashark;from theothertwoislands information
isabundant. InMaewo, Aurora, there ismorethanoneQatu,
butone,theQatu lata, isthe chief. Inallthese there is
initiation with trial ofendurance bytorments andhardships,
butthere isnosecret imparted beyond theknowledgeofthe
songanddance andthemakingofthedecorations. Forthe
initiation anenclosure ismade with reeds near agroupof

theyremain unwashed andwithverylittle foodandwater
tilltheappointed time hasexpired, which maybethirty
days. During-thistime theylearn adance, andsongs, but

endure thehardships andtortures tobegonethrough ;but
theycanenter byproxy;amanalreadyinitiated willgo

III.Solomon Islands. From theNew Hebrides toFlorida
intheSolomon Islands isalong step,butintheMatambala
appears very plainlyanother form oftheQatu. The seat of
itisadistrict ofFlorida calledBelaga, where alone therites
were celebrated, menfrom theother districts coming tobe
initiated there. Theoriginoftheinstitution isascribed to
oneSiko,whocame fromBugotuinYsabel. Tohim sacrifices
weremade intheir assemblies byasuccession ofmenwhohad
received the office tilltheyear 1883,when thelastembraced
Christianity, andtheMatambala came toanend. Themys-
teries were celebrated atirregularintervals ofsixortenyears,
buttheinitiated formed apermanent body,andacertainpart
ofthebeach atBelaga with theforest behind itwasalways
tambu, sothatnouninitiatedperson mightenter theprecincts,
andnowomanmight passalongthebeach. Within this
sacredregionthere were twelve vunut/iasanctuaries, and in
eachoneasacred vovoko house wasbuilt;butthetwovunutha
atMaterago andatVolotha were farmore important than the
rest,andthehouses built there sosacred thatnomanentered
them norevenapproached them;there wereimagesinthem
ofbirdsand fish, crocodiles andsharks, thesunandmoon, and
men. Thebuildingofthese twohouses wasthebeginning
ofthechiefpart oftheproceedings. Inallthattheydid
theysupposed themselves tobefollowingthecourse ofSiko's
actions.

initiated, godown tooccupyhouses thathavebeen builtupon
thebeach, andremain there tilltheproceedingsareover. The
initiated from eachvillagetakewiththem their friends who
aretobeadmitted, butdonotyetletthem enter thewnutta,
thesanctuaryinthebush,where theythemselves areoccupied
inmakingthestructures ofbamboo which arecalled the
tindalo, theghosts.These were ofseveral forms. One called
theVoiwasdescribed totheBishopasascreen some tenfeet
longbyninehigh,made ofbarkpainted andornamented, and
carried outbyseveral menbehind itintotheopen, where it
could beseenbythewomen, children, and uninitiated, who
firmlybelieved ittobenotsomuch thehandiwork ofghosts
asanappearanceoftheghoststhemselves. Another, the
Koitaba-vunutha, was solargethateightyorahundred men
inside itcarried itdown tothebeach, where theoutside
population gazedatit.There wasanother instrument, the
Kuku, awooden clubwith abird's head. Oneofthefirstpro-
ceedingsoftheMatambala men after thepaths wereswept,
andthecountry wasmade close,wastocutdown tallbamboos
forthese structures, tiethem inbundles, andlaythem inthe
suntodry.'After awhile theybroughtthesedown tothe
vunutha, andaddedlengthtolengthtilltheywereextremely
long ;andthentheytook vines andsago spathes andfastened
them tothebamboos which theyhadprepared; andthen
theytook coleus andturmeric;thecoleus theychewed forthe
juice andsqueezed wildorangestomixwith itandmake it
red;andtheturmerictheypoundedinawoodenpot.Then
theypainted with thesethingsthesago spathesthattheyhad
fastened ontothebamboos, variegated anddazzling, very
fearful forustobehold.' The tindalofigures,ofwhichthirty
orforty weremade inoneplace, must have resembled the
Qatumasks orhats oftheBanks' Islands, though theywere
verymuchhigher ;forlikethemtheywere conical inshape,
andweremoved bymen inside them. 'Andwhen allwas
finishedthey appointedtheirdayforthespectacle ;and all
thewomen andboyscame outintheevening andviewed the
tindalo3and allthemen inthevmiutha heldupandbrought


v.] Florida'Matambala'97
down thetindaloimagestothebeach;and allthewomen and
theboysthoughtthattheywere nothingbutghosts, because
theydidnotknowhowtheywere made. After thatthey
appointed again thedayafter themorrow fortheshow, and
when thatdaycame thewomenagain came outintotheopen
forthespectacle. Andwhen theshowmade inthatway
was over, themen took thetindaloimages back into the
vunutka, andburnt upwith fire allthoseimages. When that
was done, allthemencame back totheirvillages from
thevunutha. And itwasnotpossibletomake known -to
women andboysthingsofthiskind;butatlength, when this
Gospelreached us,then itcame out,sothat allthewomen
andtheboysandtheuninitiated understood allaboutthings
ofthis kind.'
Theuninitiated were calledtelegai, theneophytesthenew
Matambala. AsintheBanks' Islands andtheNew Hebrides,
therewasnoknowledge communicated,exceptofthefactthat
whatever wasdonewasthework ofmenandnotofghosts,
which wasnodoubt asurprisingrevelation. Still, however, we
maybesurethattheMatambala, newand old,firmlybelieved
thattheartofmakingtheimagesandthecourse ofalltheir
proceedingshadbeentaught bySiko,nowatindalo, andthat
theywereguidedandenabled bythesupernaturalassistance of
Sikoandhiscompanions, now tindalo, andbytheghostsalsoof
their eminentpredecessorsintheMatambala,allofwhom as
well asSikowereinvoked with sacrifices. Buttherewasno
esoteric doctrinetaught,noranysecret imparted beyondthatof
themakingoftheimages. Onthispointthewitness ofthe
initiated isasclear inFlorida asintheBanks' Islands andthe
New Hebrides. Acertain rite, ormark, ofinitiation there
was;thecandidateclaspedatree,andwastouched insix
places with afire-stick onshoulders, loins, and buttocks.
When thusbranded theywere toldthattheywerenow Siko's
men,orSiko's messengers.Inadmission tothese mysteries,
also, there wasnolimit ofage,andnotime oflifemore ap-
propriate than another. Grown-up menwere admitted, who
generally came from other partsoftheisland;atBelag^


98Secret Societies andMysteries. [CH.
andtheimmediate neighbourhoodtheboyswere initiated
whenever theceremonies tookplace. Young children, even
sucklings,weremadeMatambala;forthelattertheywould go
intothevillages andbegmilk from thewomen, since the
infants could notcome outofthesacred precints andthe
women could notgoin;theywerebranded with theslender
midribs oftheleaflets ofthecocoa-nut. Nothing waspaidfor
entrance totheMatambala. Theinitiation ofthenewmembers
wasnotperformedtilltheyhadbeensome timelivinginthe
houses onthebeach, while themysterious figures were being
constructed inthesecretplacesinthewood;itwaspartof
theirpreparationthattheyshould befrightened bythebird-
headed clubs, thekuku. andtheywere threatened with death
iftheyrevealed thesecrets.Altogether theyremained away
from theirhomes three months.
Duringthewhole ofthistimetheMatambala, under cover of
the terror oftheirpretendedassociation withghosts, and
taking advantageoftheclosingofthepaths,wereplaying
tricks androbbinginallthecountryround. Theywould
come asfarastoGaeta tostealpigstosacrifice toSiko;they
would cutdown trees tofallacross theroads, andnoone
dared remove them;theywouldpulldown cocoa-nut palms
andbigtrees withropesinthenightasaproofthat the
ghosts were abroad, fornomereman could besupposedso
strongastooverthrow them. From time totimethey
sacrificed toSiko. More than once alsotheymade their
appearanceinthevillages.'When thebamboos have been
cutdown, they appointathreedays' spaceforthegoing up
inland oftheghosts (that is,oftheMatambala),andwhen the
threedays' spaceispast, then about thetime oftheclock
strikingtenatnight theghosts goup.And allthewomen

Matambala down atthebeach take luro(bull-roarers),and

prevent them fromfeelingthehands ofthemen.When the
women hearthewhistle they ask,'Who areyou,areyouSiko ?'
andtheman whistles inanswer andtakes thefood. Great
carewastaken lestthemenshould beseenwhen theghosts
were believed tobeabout, andtheMatambala were covered, as
elsewhere, with acloak ofleaves;butinthedaytime they

INevery village andgroupofhouses intheTorres Islands,
theBanks' Islands, andtheNorthern New Hebrides, iscon-
spicuousabuilding- which doesnotappeartobeadwelling-
house. Inapopulous villageoftheBanks' Islands itisvery
longand low,with entrances atintervalsalong the sides
below thewall-plate, with stone seats orastoneplatformat
themain entrances ateither end,andlowstone wallsplanted
with dracaenas andcrotons near thesame, with thejawbones
ofpigsandbackbones offishhanging under theeaves;and
veryoften theclatter ofpoundingsticks inwooden vessels and
white clouds ofsteam makeknown thepreparationofameal.
This isagamal. Thesamename, andabuildingofthesame
general character, withsome difference ofform, istobefound
intheNew Hebrides asfarsouth astheShepherdIslands at
least. What arecalled'Chiefs' houses'inNew Caledonia
probably represent thesame. Insome oftheBanks' Islands,
again,avisitor onenteringavillage would seeoneormore
platforms squarelybuilt upofstones, withhigh, pointed
little edifices upon them, openinthefront likeshrines, the
embers ofafirebelow, andabove animage grotesquely shaped

Here againthere isaman, perhapstwoorthree, latelyraised

InalltheMelanesian groupsitistherulethat there isin

eatandspendtheir time, theyoung mensleep, strangersare

kept ;where imagesareseen, andfromwhich women are
generallyexcluded;thekiala ofFlorida, theokaofSan
Cristoval, themadai ofSanta Cruz, thetambu house oftraders,
thehire ofFiji ;and allthese nodoubtcorrespondtothe
lalai and otherpublichalls oftheMalay Archipelago.
Butthese arenotclub-houses, asarethegamalhouses ofthe

whoshould sethimself thetaskofmaking systematic enquiries,
must findhimself baffled attheoutset bythemultiplicityof

mind, acknowledgesthatsome dances arequite innocent,
explainsthatnone thatheknows haveanyreligious significance

Often missionaries, itistobefeared, somanageitthatneither

disclaimpretension toaccuracyorcompleteness. Thegeneral
viewwhich ispresented must betaken with theparticular
examplesofMelanesian belief andcustoms inmatters of
religion which follow.
(i)TheMelanesian mind isentirely possessed bythebelief
inasupernatural powerorinfluence, called almostuniversally
mana1
.This iswhat works toeffect everything which is

ofquoting thefollowing words fromaletter.'ThereligionoftheMelanesians
consists, asfarasbeliefgoes,inthepersuasionthat there isasupernatural
power aboutbelongingtotheregionoftheunseen;and, asfaraspractice goes,
intheuseofmeans ofgettingthispowerturned totheirown benefit. The
notion ofaSupreme Beingisaltogether foreign tothem, orindeed ofanybeing
occupying avery elevatedplaceintheir world. ..There isabelief inaforce

mind thathehas it;hebecomes achiefbyvirtue ofit.
Hence aman'spower, though politicalorsocial initscha-
racter, ishismana;theword isnaturallyused inaccordance
with thenative conceptionofthecharacter ofallpower and

certainly gotthemana ofaspiritorofsome deceased warrior

multiply, andhisgardensareproductive,itisnotbecause he
isindustrious andlooks after hisproperty,butbecause ofthe
stones fullofmana forpigsandyamsthathepossesses. Of
course ayam naturally grows whenplanted,that iswell
known, but itwillnotbevery largeunless mana comes into
play;acanoe willnotbeswift unless mana bebroughtto
bearupon it,anetwillnotcatchmany fish,noranarrow

(2)TheMelanesians believe inthe'existence ofbeings
personal, intelligent,fullofmana^ with acertainbodilyform
which isvisible butnotfleshlylikethebodies ofmen. These
they think tobemore orlessactively concerned inthe
affairs ofmen,andtheyinvoke andotherwiseapproach them.
These may becalledspirits ;but itismostimportantto
distinguish betweenspirits who arebeingsofanorder
higher thanmankind, andthedisembodiedspiritsofmen,
which havebecome inthevulgarsense ofthewordghosts.


VII.] Spirits andGhosts. 121
From theneglectofthis distinctiongreatconfusion and
misunderstanding--arises;and itismuch tobedesired that
missionaries atanyratewouldcarefullyobserve the dis-
tinction. Any personal objectofworship among1natives in
allpartsoftheworld istakenbytheEuropeanobserver
tobeaspiritoragod,oradevil;butamong1Melanesians
atanyrate itisverycommon toinvoke departedrelatives
andfriends, andtousereligiousrites addressed tothem.A
man therefore who isapproaching-withsome rite hisdead
father, whosespirit hebelieves tobeexisting- andpleased
with hispious action,isthoughttobeworshippingafalse
godordeceiving spirit, andvery probablyistold that the
being heworshipsdoes not exist. Theperplexednative
hears with one earthat there isnosuch thingasthat
departed spiritofamanwhich hevenerates asaghostbut
hisinstructor takes tobeagod,andwith theother thatthe
soulnever dies,andthat hisownspiritualinterests arepara-
mount andeternal. They themselves make aclear distinction
between theexisting, conscious, powerful,disembodiedspirits
ofthedead, andotherspiritual beingsthatnever have been
men atall. Itistrue that thetwo orders ofbeings get
confused innativelanguage andthought, buttheir confu-

thatthey speakofbeings whowere nevermen asghosts;
Europeans take thespiritsofthelatelydead forgods;less
educated Europeanscallthemroundlydevils. AllMela-
nesians, asfarasmyacquaintance withthem extends, believe
intheexistence both ofspiritsthatnever weremen,andof
ghosts which arethedisembodied souls ofmen deceased :to
preserve asfaraspossiblethis distinction, thesupernatural
beingsthatwere never inahuman bodyarehere called

Thereis,however, averyremarkable difference between the
natives oftheNew Hebrides andBanks' Islands totheeast,
andthenatives oftheSolomon Islands tothewest;the
direction ofthereligiousideasandpracticesoftheformer is
jtowardsspiritsrather thanghosts, thelatterpayverylittle
attention tospirits andaddress themselves almostwhollyto
e^.ghosts.Thisgoes with amuchgreater developmentofa
sacrificial system inthewest than intheeast;andgoes
alongalsowithacertain advance intheartsoflife.Enoughis
hardly known oftheSanta Cruzpeople, who liebetween, to
speakwithcertainty, buttheyappeartorange themselves, as
theyrather dogeographically, ontheside oftheSolomon
Islands. InFijiitistheestablished custom tocalltheobjects
oftheoldworship gods ;butMr. Fison was'inclined to
think allthespiritual beingsofFiji,includingthegods, simply
theMota tamate?i.e.ghosts ;andthewords ofMr.Hazel-
wood, quoted byMr.Brenchley (CruiseoftheCuracoa, p.181),
confirm thisview. Tuikilakila toldoneofthe firstmission-
arieshowheproposedtotreat him.'Ifyoudie first,' saidhe,
'1shallmake youmygod.'Andthesame Tuikilakila would
sometimessayofhimself,'Iamagod.'Itisadded thathe
believed ittoo;and hisbelief wassurelycorrect. For it
should beobserved thatthechief never saidhewasorshould

inFijian, andakalou henodoubt became;that istosay,on
hisdecease hisdeparted spirit wasinvoked andworshipped

saidonly'Iakalou? InFijialso thisworshipofthedead,
rather than ofbeingsthatnever were intheflesh, accom-
panies amore considerable advance inthearts oflifethan is
foundin,forexample, theBanks' Islands. Itisplain that
thenatives ofthesouthern islands oftheNew Hebrides,
though theyare said toworship'
gods,' believe inthe
existence andpower ofspiritsother than thedisembodied
could befound must beused, since thelanguagesareatleast asmanyasthe

SACRIFICES.
THEsimplestandmostcommon sacrificial act isthat of
throwingasmallportionoffood tothedead;this isprobably
auniversalpracticeinMelanesia. Afragmentoffoodready
tobeeaten, ofyam,aleafofmallow, abitofbetel-nut,is
thrown aside, and,wheretheydrink kava, alibation ismade
ofafewdrops,astheshare ofdeparted friends, orasa
memorial ofthem withwhich theywillbegratified.This is
done perhapswith thecallingofthename ofsome one
recentlydeceased orparticularlyinremembrance atthetime,
orelsewith ageneral regardtotheghostsofformer members
ofthecommunity.Itishardly thoughtthat thisbecomes in

little bitswere eatenbythosewho desired togetfighting

Such sacrifices werethought more effectual thanothers, and
advantage wastaken ofacrime, orimputed crime, totake a
lifeand offertheman tosome tindalo. Sowithin thememory
ofmen stillyoung, Dikea, thechief ofRavu, condemned one
Gisukokovilo todeath forstealing tobacco, andthegrownlads
ofHandika atebitsofhimcooked inthesacrificial fire.The
same Dikea offered ahuman sacrifice intheyear 1886. Two
calamities had fallen uponDikea. One ofhiswivesproved
false,andhesentheraway, vowingthat sheshould notreturn
tillhehad sacrificed toHauri. Also hissonhaddied,andhe
made avowthathewould killaman forhim. Some thought
thathewould killaman toburywith theboy,buthedidnot.
Heduguphisburied sonthathemightseehimoncemore;

(2)The character ofwhatmaybecalled sacrifices inthe
Banks' Islands andNorthern New Hebrides differsverymuch
from that ofthe sacrifices oftheSolomon Islands intwo
respects ;theofferingsareasarulemade tospiritsandnotto

Intheuseoftheword intheBanks' Islands which hasbeen
taken asequivalentto'sacrifice,' viz.oloolo,itisimportantto
observe that theword isnotemployedinreference tothe

ofpropitiatingaspiritafteranoffence, aswell asameans of
obtaining what isdesired. Food also isbynomeans commonly
thethingoffered;intheBanks' Islandsperhaps nothingbut
native moneyistheoffering.
Thespirits who areapproachedwith theseofferingsare
almostalwaysconnected with stones onwhich theofferings
aremade. Such stones have some ofthem been sacred to
somespirit from ancient times, andtheknowledgeofthe
waytoapproachthespiritwho isconnected withthem has
beenhanded down tothemanwhonowpossessesit.But
anymanmayfindastone forhimself, theshapeofwhich
strikes hisfancy, orsome otherobject, anoctopusinhishole,
ashark, asnake, aneel,which seems tohimsomething unusual,
andtherefore connected with aspirit. Hegetsmoney and
scatters itabout thestone, orontheplacewhere hehasseen

dreams thatsome onetakeshim toaplaceandshews himthe

kava;thesickman issaidtooloolo tothepossessor ofthe
stone. The latter takes thethingsoffered tohissacredplace
andthrows them down, saying,'LetSo-and-So recover.'
When thesickman recovers hepaysafee. Ifaman desires
togetthebenefit ofthestone, orwhatever itis,known to
another, with aview toincrease ofmoney, pigsorfood, or
success infighting,thepossessor ofthestone willtakehimto
hissacredplace, whereprobablythere aremany stones, each

willshewhimonestone andsay,'This isabigyam,' andthe
worshipper putsmoney down. Ofanother hesaysitisaboar,
ofanother that itisapigwith tusks, andmoneyisputdown.
Thenotion isthat thespirit,vuiyattached tothestone likes

AMELANESIAN native indanger, difficulty and distress, will

whichexpresshisfeelings.This from hispointofview

There are alsosongs, incantations, charms, which have

them. These arenotaddresseddirectlytothebeings whose
power they bringtobear,andwould notbecalledprayers.
There arebesides invocations which maybecalledprayers,
that isformal addresses tobegforsuccour orforaid.But it
iscertainly very difficult, ifnotimpossible,tofind inany
Melanesian languageaword whichdirectlytranslates the

intheSolomon Islands areofcourse made tothebeingsto
whomtheylookthere forother thanhuman aid,tothetindalo,

atsacrifices areprayers ;andthosemayproperlybesocalled
which areused atsea.Thus atFlorida toDaula, atindalo
generally known andconnected with thefrigate-bird:'Do
thoudraw thecanoe, that itmay reach theland;speedmy
canoe, grandfather, that Imayquicklyreach theshore whither
Iambound. Dothou, Daula, lightenthecanoe, that itmay

orisrepresented byone,beingcalled Bagea. Theycallalso
upontheir immediate forefathers when indanger onthe
sea;oneonhisgrandfather,another onhisfather, another
onsome dead friend;calling them with reverence, and
saying,'Save usonthedeep,save usfrom thetempest,
bringustothe shore.' Daula isinvoked toaidinfishing:
'Ifthou artpowerful, mana,ODaula, putafish ortwo
into thisnetand letthem diethere.' After agoodcatch
heispraised:'Powerful, mana,isthe tindalo ofthe net.'
Theyrubfishing-lineswith theleavesappropriatedtosuch a
tindalo. InSanCristoval the'ataroghostsareappliedtofor
helpinbattle, insickness, and forgood crops ;butlihungai,
theword they use,conveysrather thenotion ofcharm than of
prayer;theformula ishanded down from father toson,oris

specialconnexion with alidaghost will, indangeratsea,
callonhisfather orgrandfather;butonewhoknows some

inwhich power over theelements resides, andwhen hehas
done that, callsonthemannowdeadwho introduced himto
thelioaandtaught himtheincantation, andafter thatagain
uponhisfather andhisgrandfather.
The tataro oftheBanks' Islands, which maybecalled a
prayer,isstrictlyaninvocation ofthedead,and isnodoubt
socalled because theform begins with thewordtataro, which
certainlyisthe 'ataro ofSan Cristoval, that isaghost of

SPIEITS.
BEINGS ofamore orlessdistinctly spiritual nature, who
atanyratenever weremen,have theirplaceinthebeliefs and
inthe stories oftheBanks' Islands andtheNew Hebrides
verymuch more than intheSolomon Islands. Koevasi,
already mentioned, inFlorida andKahausibware inSanCris-
tovalbelongtothelattergroup, andmaywellbesupposed
tobethesamepersonage under different names. Both were
never human, yetinsomeway originatorsofthehuman
race;bothwere female, bothsubjects ofstories, notobjectsof
worship. Kahausibware wasaHi'ona, abeingofsuper-
human character, dwelling onthemountain ofBauro, the
central mass ofSan Cristoval, inthetime oftheinfancy
ofthehuman race. Shewas asnake inoutward form.
There wasinthesameplaceawoman, ahumanbeing,the

thefruits oftheearthgrew without labour, and allwasofthe

island isnowfurnished, anddeath hadnotyetappeared. The

'Igo,andwho willhelpyounow ?'Shemade herway
down totheseaaccordingly,andhertrack became awater-

from thence shecould seetheBauro mountain;shewent on
further toUlawa, andthenceagaintothesouth-east endof
Malanta, buteven there inclear weather shecould seeher
former home. Shecrossed therefore toMarau, thesouth-east
partofGuadalcanar nearest toSanCristoval. where theview
ofthemountain ofBauro isshut offbythenearer hills;there
sherests tillthepresent day. Since herdepartureallthings
inSanCristoval have deteriorated. Snakes upon theBauro
mountain arevenerated astheprogenyorrepresentativesof
Kahausibware;buttheyaresimple snakes, andshewasa

IntheBanks* Islands andintheNorthern New Hebrides

ableandunnamed. These aretheywhoserepresentative form

theyarepowerfultoassist thosewhocanapproach them, and
alsotoinjure men,though theyarenotofamalignantnature.
Theyarecertainlybelieved tohave nobody; yetitis

Itisremarkableagainthat ofthese superhuman beings
who arecalled vuiorwuiintheBanks' Islands andNew
Hebrides, andwhose actions arelikethose ofmen, there seem
tobetwokinds ororders. QatintheBanks' Islands stories
andTagarointheNew Hebrides stories move likeheroes or
demigodsamidst alesser folk ofdwarfs and trolls asfullof
mysterious magic powerasthey are,butcomparativelyrude
andeasilydeceived. Theselingeredintheislands when Qat
andhisbrothers andTagaro andhisbrothers leftthem;they
havebeen seen oflateinhuman form, smaller than thenative
people, darker, andwithlong straighthair. Marawa, the
friend ofQat,wasoneofthese.AmanlivinginVanua

Some vui, spiritual beings, yetinsomeway corporeal,
figure strangelyinthe stories ofMota asNopitu, and of
Motlav, inanother form ofthesame word, asDemlnt. There
isoften adifficultyinunderstanding what istoldabout them,
because thename Nopituisgiven both tothespirit and to
theperson possessed bythespirit, whoperforms wonders by
thepower andinthename oftheNopitu whopossesseshim.
Such aonewould callhimself Nopitu; rather, speakingof

would hear aNopitu say'Mother, Iamcomingtoyou,'and
shewould feelthespirit enteringinto her,and itwould be

Rongoloa, wasnotlong agostilllivingatMotlav. The
Nopitu,likeotherspirits, were thefamiliarsonlyofthose
whoknew them, and these were often women. Ifaman

TheplaceofQatinthepopularbeliefs oftheBanks' Islands
was sohighand soconspicuousthatwhen thepeoplefirst
became known toEuropeansitwassupposedthathewastheir
god,thesupremecreator ofmenandpigsand food. Itis
certain thathewasbelieved tohavemadethingsinanother
sense from that inwhich men could besaidtomake them.

arenodoubtmanyofhisfeats andadventures which the
natives have kepttothemselves. Thestory which follows
istranslated, with additions from other sources, from the
Mota ofthe latenative Deacon EdwardWogale, himself
oftheSeperestock.
TheStory ofQat. Qatwas notwithout abeginning1
,
buthehadamother whose name wasQatgoro (otherwise
IroUl),andthismother wasastone that burst asunder and
brought him forth. Hehadnofather, andhewasborn on
theroad. Hegrew upandtalked atonce. Heasked his
mother what hisname was,saying that ifhehadafather or
anuncle onhismother's side,oneofthem would namehim;
then hegavehimself thename ofQat.Hehadbrothers
also. The firstwasTangaro Gilagilala, TangarotheWise,
who understood allthings, and could instruct the rest;
thesecond wasTangaro Loloqong, TangarotheFool,who
wasignorantofeverything, andbehaved likeafool;the
others wereTangaro Siria, Tangaro Nolas, Tangaro Nokalato,
Tangaro Noav, Tangaro Nopatau, Tangaro Noau, Tangaro
Nomatig, Tangaro Novunue, Tangaro Novlog ;eleven of
them, allTangaro,twelve inallwith Qat. Thenames ofthe
lastnine aremadeupofthenames oftheleaves oftreesand
plants, Nettle-leaf, Bread-fruit-leaf, Bamboo-leaf, Cocoa-nut-
leaf, Umbrella-palm-leaf,added toTangaro, which isno
doubt thesame with theTagarooftheNew Hebrides and
theTangaroaofthePolynesians. These allgrewupassoon
astheywere born, andtheytookuptheir abode inthevillage
AloSepere, where their mother, turned intoastone,mayyet
beseen. There Qatbegantomakethings, men, pigs, trees,
rocks, asthefancytookhim. Butwhen hehadmade all
sorts ofthings hestillknew nothow tomakenight, andthe
daytime wasalways light. Then said hisbrothers tohim,
'Hallo !Qat, this isnotatallpleasant,here isnothingbut
day; can'tyoudosomethingforus?' Then, seeking what he
could dowith thedaylight,heheard that there wasnightat
Vava, intheTorres Islands';sohetook apigandtiedit,and

putitinto hiscanoe, and sailed over toVava, where he
bought night, qong,from IQong, Night, who lived there.
Otherssaythathepaddledtothefoot ofthesky,tobuy
nightfrom Night, andthatNight blackened hiseyebrows,
andshowed himsleepthatevening, andtaught him inthe
morning how tomake thedawn. Qatreturned tohisbrothers
with theknowledgeofnight, andwith afowlandother
birds, togivenotice ofthetime forthereturn oflight. So
hebadethempreparethemselvesbed-places ;andthey platted
cocoa-nut fronds andspread them inthehouse. Then forthe
firsttimetheysawthesunmoving andsinkingtothewest,
and called outtoQatthat itwascrawling away.'Itwill
soonbegone,'saidhe;'and ifyouseeachange onthefaceof
theearth, that isnight.' Then heletgothenight.'What
isthiscomingoutofthe sea,'they cried,*andcoveringthe
sky?'*That isnight,'saidhe;'sitdown onboth sides of
thehouse, andwhen youfeelsomethinginyour eyes,liedown
andbequiet.' Presentlyitwasdark,andtheireyesbeganto
blink. 'Qat! Qat! what isthis? shallwedie?''Shut
your eyes,'saidhe;*this isit,gotosleep.' When night had
lasted longenoughthecockbegantocrowandthebirds to
twitter;Qattookapieceofredobsidian andcutthenight
with it1
;thelightoverwhich thenight hadspreaditself
shone forthagain, andOat's brothers awoke. After thishe
occupiedhimselfagaininmaking things.
Accordingto'thestorytoldatLakona, inSanta Maria, Qat
andMarawa(anothervuiwhoherecorrespondstotheSupwe
ofMaewo andAraga)dwelt intheirplaceatMatan, near to
themountain Garat, where thevolcanic fires stillsmoulder.
They twomademen inthisway. Qatcutwood ofdracaena-
trees intoshape ;heformedlegs, arms, trunks, heads, and
added earsandeyes;thenhefittedparttopart,andsixdays
heworked about it.After thishefixed thetime ofsixdays
forthem tocome tolife. Three dayshehidthem away, and

three daysheworked togivethem life.Hebrought them
forth and setthem upbefore hisface;then hedanced to
them andsawthattheymoved alittle;hebeatthedrum for
them, andsawthattheymoved more than before. Thus he
beguiled them into life,sothattheycould stand ofthemselves.
Then hedivided them, settingeachmalebyhimself andgiving
himafemale, andhecalled thetwohusband andwife. Three
women hemade, andthree men. ButMarawa made hisof
another tree,thetavisoviso;heworked atthem sixdays also,
andsetthemup,andbeatthedrum forthem, andgavethem
lifeasOathaddone forhis.Butwhen hesawthemmove
hedugapit,covered thebottom ofitwith cocoa-nut fronds,
andburied hismenandwomen initforsixdays. Thenwhen
hescrapedofftheearth with hishands toviewthem, hefound
them allrotten andstinking;andthiswastheoriginofdeath
among men.
AccordingtothestoryastoldinMota, Qatmademenand
pigsatfirstinthesame form, butonhisbrothersremonstrating
withhimonthesameness ofhiscreatures, hebeatdown the
pigstogoonallfours andmademenwalkupright. Man
wasmade ofclay,theredclayfrom themarshyriverside at
Vanua Lava. The firstwoman wasIroVilgale. Qattookrods
andringsofsupple twigs andfashioned herastheymake
thetallhats fortheqatu,bindingontheringstotherods,and
coveringalloverwith thespathesofsago-palms:hence her
name frommltobind,andgale todeceive. When allwas
finished hesawasmile, andthen heknew that shewasa
living woman.
Qathad,however, awife, afemale vui,IroLeibyname, but
hehadnochildren. Hisbrothers, whohadnowives oftheir
own, envied himthepossessionofthebeautiful HoLei,aswell
asofhisexcellent canoe, andwerealways conspiringtoget
both into theirownhands. When hiswork ofcreation was
completed, Qatproposedtohisbrothers thattheyshould cut
canoes forthemselves, andtheybegantowork, eachchoosing
adifferent kind oftree. Qat cutdown alargetree well
suited foracanoe, andworkedsecretly every day,butmade no

progressinhiswork;every daywhen hereturned towork he
found thewood thathehadchopped away replaced, andthe
treemade solidagain.Atlength oneevening when hehad
finished hisday'swork helaydown towatch, makinghimself
small, andcoveringhimself with alarge chipwhich hedrew
awayfrom the restand hid.Presentlyhesawalittle old
manwithlongwhite haircreepoutoftheground andbegin
toreplacethechips,each intheplacefromwhich ithad

there wasone defectiveplacetowhich thechip belonged
which Qathadhidden, andtheoldmanbegantosearch forit,
andQatwatched. After awhile hesaw itandadvanced to
take it;butQatleapt upfrom underit,lifting uphisshell
axetocuthimdown. ButMarawa, thespider, anothervery
powerful vui,forthiswas he,entreated Qat,'Ah,friend, don't
killme,andIwillmake yourcanoe allright again ;'andhe
worked atit,andsoon finished itwith hisnails1
.When
allthecanoes were finished, Qatbade hisbrothers launch
their own,and aseachwaslaunched helifted hishand, and
onebyonetheysank. Then QatandMarawaappearedin
theonethattheyhadmade, paddling swiftly about, tothe
astonishment ofthebrothers, whohadnotknown thatQathad

mortification, herecovered their canoes forthem inthenight.
After thishisbrothers triedwithmanydeceits todestroy Qat,
sothattheymight possessthemselves ofhiswifeand his
canoe. Onedaythey tookhim tothehole ofaland crab
under astone, which theyhadalreadysoprepared bydigging

crawled into theholeandbegantodigforthecrab;his
brotherstipped overthestone upon him, and,thinking him
crushed todeath, ranofftoseizeEoLeiandthecanoe. But
Qatcalled onMarawa byname,'Marawa !takemeround about

When hefellasthebranch broke, and astheythoughtwas

Qatwashimself always readytoplaytricks onhisbrothers,

Again theyconsulted howtheymight destroy him, and
determined toentrap himwhilesnaringbirds.They prepared
eachone forhimself hisplaceinanutmeg-tree,each insuc-
cession further andfurther from thevillage, andthetree for
Qatmuch further awaythan all.Then they tookQatout
andshewed him hisplace. Qatmounted into histree,andas

arms could neverclasp it,and all itsboughs andbranches
equallyswelled out. ButQatdidnotatfirst discoverthis,
because hewasbusy settinghissnares;hisbrother whohad
laidthespellupon thenutmeg-tree ranback, collectingthe
others ashewent into thevillage ;they seized andcarried
offRoLei,dragged down thecanoe intothe sea,andpaddled
offatonce. Theisland hadalreadysunk outoftheirsight
when theyblew their shelltrumpettoletQatknow thatthey
weregone. When heheard itheknew what hadhappened,
andwould have followed them, butthe size oftheswelled
branches ofthenutmeg-tree made itimpossibleforhim to
descend; hetriedand tried invain,andthen lifteduphis
voice andwept. His friend Marawa, theSpider, heard his
cries,andcame toaskhimwhatwasthematter.'Ican'tget
down,' saidhe;'mybrothers haveplayed methis trick.'
'Down withyou,'saidMarawa, whose hairwasexceedingly
long and loose;andhesentuphishair toQat,who de-
scended byitandranintothevillage. There hefound the
rollers ofhiscanoe aloneremaining, andsoughthiswife in
vain, forhisbrothers hadtaken offhiswifeandhiscanoe to
betheir own. Then Qatwent inside hishouse, andtook his
cock's-tailplume, andhisstringofthesmallestshell-money,
hisredearth, andhisshell hatchet, andasked hismother for
hisbanana fruit.'They haveplucked themall,'sheanswered,
1
exceptthese little ones attheendofthebunch.''Pluck
them alloff/saidQat. Then hetook acocoa-nut-shell bottle
andstowed allhisthings andhisfoodwithinit,made him-
selfsmall andtook hisseatwithinit,andbade hismother
count three waves, andatthefourth small wave tothrow it
intothe sea. SoQat floated onandoninthebottle tillhe
cameuptothecanoe inwhich hisbrothers were, fortheyhad
notyetreached land. Then hefloated alongbefore thebow
ofthecanoe, andwhere hedriftedtheywere forced tofollow.
By-and-byhetook oneofhisbananas andateit,andthrew
theskin into theseawhere thecanoe would comealong.
Hisbrothers sawit,andremarked that itwas likethose

bananas ofQat's thattheyhadtaken;they enquired among
themselves whohadbeeneatingabanana, andwhen alldenied,
TangarotheWise spokeout :'You fellows,' saidhe,'itis
Qatwhohaseaten thisbanana, andhasthrown theskin of
ithere forus,togiveusnotice thatheisnotdead,butthathe
hasescapedand isfollowingus.'Buttherestofthem would
notlisten tohim, declaringthatQatwasdead. Thesame
happened againwhen hethrew outforthem another banana
skin. After thistheysawthebottle itself inwhich Qatwas
floating,closeuptothecanoe, andoneofthem took itup,
thinkingthat itwasagood cocoa-nut, butwhen hesmelt it
andfound thesmell bad,hethrew itaway again.Thisthey

ofMaewo, andemergedfrom hisbottle;hecolours hishair

head, sticks hiscock's-tail plumeinhishair, takes hisseaton

sitsandwaits forhisbrothers tocome tolandwhowere still

totheshore, andthen theylooked upandsawhimsitting

hisbrothersarguedthathecould nothavemade hisway

hisbrothers about thisand allotherthings. Sotheybrought
their canoe toland, buthadnoneed tohaul itup,forQat

down uponthem with hisaxe,andhewed thecanoe topieces
forthem with thissong,'Chop, chopthecanoe;whose
canoe isit?Marawa's canoe. Mybrothers tricked meabout
twisting astringswell nutmeg-tree anddraw thesnare.
Ihadone canoe,mycanoe slippedofffrom me.' Sohe
chopped thecanoe topiecesbefore their face. After thishe
made friends with them, andbadethem live inharmony
together.


x.] Adventures ofQat. 163
Another remarkable series ofadventures were Qat's en-
counters with Qasavara. Thiswasavui,very strong-,agreat
fighter, tyrantandcannibal, whodwelt intheisland which
wasthehome ofQatandhisbrothers. Onedaythebrothers
went tobathe, andfoundfloating down thestream afruit of
theTahitian chestnut, amake. The others took itupone
after another andrejected it,thinkingitwasnotgood,but
Qattook itandfound itgood, andgaveittohismother to
cook. Each ofthebrothers ashereturned frombathingwent
totheirmother forfood. Shehadnothing butQat's make,
andtheyeachtook abitofit;TangarotheFool finished it.
Qatsentthem togetsome more, andfollowing upthestream
down which this fruithad floated theycame uponthetree.
Theyclimbed uponittogatherthechestnuts, andTangaro
theFooldropped oneupon thehouse ofQasavara, overwhich
thebrancheshung. Outcame theogreinarage,seized and
killed thebrothers, andputthem inhisfood-chest. Qat
waited fivedays, then took hisbowandarrows and shell
hatchet andwent insearch. Followingthestream hefound
the tree,anddivining what hadhappened, broughtout
Qasavara bydroppingamakeonhishouse. They fought,and
Qatkilled Qasavara;then, searchingforhisbrothers, hefound
their bones inthefood-chest. Herevived thembyblowing
throughareed into their mouths, andbidding them, ifthey
were hisbrothers, laugh. Another adventure notverycon-
sistent with this isthus narrated. Qasavarafallinginwith
Qatandhisbrothers invited them tohisvillage, andmade a
fireinhisoven forthem. When itwasevening hetoldthem
thattheywere tosleepbythemselves inhisgamal ;butthey,
knowingthattheywould bekilled, were exceedinglyafraid.
Nightfellandtheywerevery sleepy,andQatcalled them to

when itwas cleardayQasavara andhismenrunningtothe

Qatandhisbrothers tookuptheir abode atTatgan.Itwas,
however, fromGaua thatthestorymakes Qat tohavetaken
hisdeparture from theworld. Where nowinthecentre of
that island isthegreat lake, theTas, there wasformerlya

Itisveryprobablethat Lata,who issaidbythepeopleof
Santa Cruz tohavemademenandanimals, isregarded by
them asQatwasregarded bythepeopleoftheBanks'

Astorywhich istoldofNatei, nowthechiefman atNelua in
Santa Cruz, shews abelief alsoinsuchbeingsastheBanks'

thesimilarstoryofManlepeiinVanua Lava wasdoubtless
toldofsome other man,andbysome otherman ofhimself,
longbefore histime. Thepresent younger generationat
Santa Cruzseeing Natei agreat man,andtakingitofcourse
that hisgreatness camebysupernatural assistance,tellthis
storyofhim.When hewasayonng man, they say,hewas
followingtheupwardcourse ofanarrow valley lookingfor
birds tomakefeather-money, andadvanced farinland intothe

answered thathewasaman. ToNatei' slikeenquirythe

After thispeople would giveNatei money andotherthings

Thenearest oftheBanks' Islands totheNew Hebrides is
Merlav, Star Island, andthere Qatand hisbrothers arethe

northernmost oftheNew Hebrides andnearest toMerlav is
Maewo, Aurora, andthere Qat,thoughnotunknown, isnot

Tagarolived atMambarambara, andparticularlyatHombio,

CHAPTER XL -

SACRED PLACES AND THINGS.
ITisalmost certain that idols findnoplaceintheaccount
which Inowproceedtogiveofsacredplaces andobjectsas
Iamacquainted withthem inMelanesia. Itistruethatthe
word is5commonly enoughused todescribe anykind ofimage
ofnative workmanship, whether there bereally somethingof
asacred character attached toit,ornone whatever. The
peopleofSan Cristoval, Ugi,andUlawa wereconspicuous
fortheir fondness forcarving andthe skillwithwhich they
worked;amanamong themwould amuse himself byshaping
asoftstone orbitofwood intoafigureofaman orbird, or
fish, aswell asincarving bywayofdecoration whathemade
foruse. Ihave seen atFagani (Ha'ani)inSanCristoval
aremarkablyclever group over theapexofagable, which
representedamanclimbing uptoshoot anopossum, andthe
animallooking down uponhimfrom thetopofthepolein
themost natural attitude. Thiswouldhardlybetaken for
anidol,but isasmuch anidol asmany figures which have
found theirwayintomuseums assuch. The canoe-houses,
common halls, public-houses,called inthoseparts oka,were
fullofcarvingsintheconstructive aswell asdecorativeparts.
Some ofthese, thepostsforexamplewhichsupporttheridge-
poleandpurlins, areoftenfiguresofmen,whowould be
looselycalled ancestors bytheprincipal peopleofthevillage,
andthese would betreated withrespect;sometimes foodand
betel-nuts would beseen laidbefore them. Butthese hadno
sacred character, further than thatthey were memorials of


174 Sacred Places andThings. [CH.
deceased great men,whoseghosts visitingtheir accustomed
abodes would bepleased'atmarks ofmemoryand affection,
and irritated bydisrespect.There wasnonotion ofthe
ghostofthedead taking uphisabode intheimage,norwas
theimage supposedtohaveanysupernatural efficacyinitself.
InanyohainMalanta maybeseenanimageofashark, a
sword-fish, orabonito, before whichportionsoffood are
placed;andthesefigureswillbesaid tobefathers, grand-
fathers, ancestors ofthosewho thusrespect them. These
areindeedreceptaclesofthedead, notoftheirspirits,butof
their mortal remains orrelics;such cannot becalled idols.
Althoughtoothey sometimes make other images andgive
thenames ofthedead tothem bywayofremembrance, they
donotprayorsacrifice atsuchimages, noraretheythought
holy.InFlorida arudely-shaped imageofamanmight
often havebeen seen inasacredplacenear avillageorbythe
sea-shore, with cocoa-nuts tied toitorfood laid atitsfeet;
thiswould beatindalo, animage representing some powerful
mandeceased;thefoodwould beforhimtoeat;theimagewas
sacred. That istosay,theimage wasamemorial ofsome
tindalo, andwasnotthoughttohavepowerinitself, ortobe
inhabited bytheghostofthedeparted. Images representing
atindalo were alsocutonthepostsofthecanoe-houses, mere
memorials notmuchregarded,andapproached withoutrespect.
The stocks setupinSanta Cruz torepresentthedead are
thesimplestofmemorials. IntheBanks' Islands tree-fern
trunks cutintoveryrudefiguresofmenwere often seen
memorials made atfuneralfeasts, having really nosacred
character atall.Inthesame islands theimagescarried
about attheSuqe feasts, andafterwards setupintheeating-
places propertotherankthey represent, maywellbetaken
foridolsbythosewho arenotacquainted with theirmeaning ;
and soindeed maythefigure, thenule, intowhich thepost

figureoftheparticular deceased, butinconventional form;
sometimes carved outoftree-fern trunks, sometimes fashioned
withwickerwork andsago spathes, andpainted andadorned.
Some shutupfromcommon viewbybamboo screens may
probably belongtosecret societies. Inthesame island drams
are setupforfuneral feasts with fantastic faces cutupon
them, andthese remain asinamannerimagesofthedeceased,
taken byvisitors foridols ordevil-drums. Intheneighbour-
ingislands similar imagesaremade.
Sacredplaces have almost alwaysstones inthem;itis
impossible totreatseparatelysacredplaces andsacred stones.
Butwhereas someplacesaresacred because stones arethere,
thestones seen inotherplaces havebeentaken there aspart
ofthefurniture ofasacredplace. Someplacesalsoand
stones maybesaid tohave theoriginoftheir sacredness in
gravesorrelics ofthedead,and sohavehadtheir character
given them bymen;while others aresacred because the
stones arethere, thestones beingsacred becauseassociated
with aspirit.Itiswellhere torecall thedistinction which
seems soimportant betweenghosts,thedisembodiedspirits
ofmen deceased, andspirits,ofanother order from thesouls
ofmen, which have never been connected with ahuman
body; andtoremember that, speaking generally,thereligion
oftheSolomon Islands isconcerned withghosts,thatofthe
Banks' Islands andNew Hebrides withspirits.
The sacredplaces andobjectsoftheSolomon Islands
shall befirstdescribed;and firstofallthose which belongto
sepulture. InFlorida asacredplaceiscalled vunuka.

without duecause;"butthoseplaces where theremains of
peopleofrank aredeposited,where sacrifices areoffered, and
which maybecalledfamily sanctuaries, areregarded with
very great respect. Some ofthese arevery ancient, thelio'a,
orpowerful ghost, who isworshipped there, beingaremote
ancestor. Itsometimes happensthat themanwho has
offered the sacrifice insuch aplacedieswithout having fully
instructed hissonintheproper chant ofinvocation with
which theHoaoughttobeapproached. Theyoung manwho
succeeds him isthen afraid togothere often, andbeginsa
newplace, taking some ashes from theoldsacrificialfire-place
tostart thenewsanctuary.Itisnotcommon inthatpartof
Malanta tobuild shrines forrelics, but itissometimes done
when theoJia^canoe-house,isfull. Such shrines arecommon
inSan Cristoval inthevillages,and inthesacredplaces
wheregreatmenhave been buried. Totrespass onthese
sacredplaces would bealways likelytorouse theangerofthe
ghosts, some ofwhom besides areknown tobeofamalignant
disposition. Such aone isTapia, whose haunt isatthe
mouth ofariver near Ha'ani, and sacrifice towhom has
beenalreadydescribed.
There aresacredplaces, however, intheSolomon Islands
which arenotplacesofsepulture, though none probablythe
sacredness ofwhich doesnotdependonthepresenceofa
ghost. InFlorida theappearanceofsomethingwonderful
willcause anyplacetobecome avunuha, thewonder being
anevidence oftheghostly presence. Forexample,aman

intheBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides aresharks and

theBanks' Islands asharkmaybeatangaroa, asortoffamiliar

beenabove related ofLodo andhisshark atSavo;andthe
difference isinstructive that intheBanks' Islands theshark
wasaspirit andintheSolomon Islands itwasaghost.In
theNew Hebrides somemenhave thepower,asthenatives
believe, ofchanging themselves into sharks, asmaybeseen in
thestoryofTarkeke. Agreatdeal ofsuperstitioniscon-
nected with snakes, notonlybecause one issure tobeseen

tobeotherwise connected with avui, spirit,tohave aspirit

IntheNew Hebrides snakes areperhaps moreregarded than
intheBanks' Islands. Anative ofPentecost Island, ifhe

himself thejuiceofayoung cocoa-nut, andeverafterwards
expecttofind theworld gowellwithhimthrough the

house, moreparticularlyifitbeagreatman's house, theyare
persuadedthat itisaspirit ;itisgogona, nottobelightly ap-
proached;itbrings goodluck tothehouse, andmakes the
owner riseintheJiuqe society. Thehouse itself istreated
withrespect ;noone \tfillthrow astone atit,ormount upon
it;thesnake would resent suchdisrespect andmake the
offender ill.
There isanamphibioussea-snake marked with bands of
darkandlight colour, which intheBanks' Islands andNew
Hebrides isalways more orlessdreaded whenever itisseen.
Inthese islands itisgenerallycalled mae,and itisthiskind
ofsnake which becomes thefamiliarspiritofthosewhohave,

(2)Weather. Inallthese islands itisbelieved thatspirits
andghostshavepowerovertheweather;itfollows, therefore,
that themenwhohave familiar intercourse withspirits and
ghostsarebelieved tobeable tomovethem tointerfere for
wind orcalm, sunshine orrain, asmaybedesired. The
spiritsandghostsalsohaveimparted powertoforms ofwords,
stones, leaves, andotherthings, which therefore ofthemselves
affect theweather;andthere isalsoacertain natural con-
gruity between some ofthesethings andthe effect they
produce, which seems tomakethem suitable vehicles ofpower.
Themen, therefore, whohaveandknow thesethings have
withthem manawhich theycanusetobenefit ortoafflict
friends andenemies, and toturn either wayasitismade
worth their while toturn it.There areeverywhere, therefore,
inthese islands weather-doctors orweather-mongers whocan
control the aerialpowers, and arewillingtosupply wind,
calm, rain, sunshine, famine, andabundance ataprice. These
weregenerallyalsomasters ofother charms than those which
affect theweather, someknew oneweather charm andsome
another;butthere weregenerallyinacommunity enough
forallrequirements.Their artsonce secret arenowpretty
wellknown. InFlorida themanenggehe vigona, when acalm
waswanted, tiedtogethertheleavesappropriatetohisvigoua
andhidthem inthehollow ofatreewhere water was, calling
uponthevigona spiritwith theproper charm. Thisprocess
wouldbring down rain tomake thecalm. Ifsunshine was

IntheseafaringlifeoftheSolomon Islands themaker of

great voyagers,andtheir mendtka wizards control theweather
ontheirexpeditions, taking withthem thestock which
representstheir duka^ andsettingitupinthecabin onthe

thus secured, theweather-doctor willundertake toprovidefair

charms have theirpowerbecause ofTagaro's name inthem.
Together with weather-charms maybeclassed those used
intheBanks' Islands toassist asowinher first litter of
pigs:such asbeatingherback with branches ofapepper
closely resemblingthatused forkava, strewingtheblossoms of
thewotaga, Barringtonia, upon herback, layingcocoa-nut
fronds onher,breakingabamboo water-vessel overherback so
thatthesalt-water mayrunover her,hangingabagfullof
native almonds above herhead;allbeing donewith theap-
propriate form ofwords. Nets alsoused forthe firsttime are
charm idwith leaves andthesongmana forthepurpose. In
Lepers'Island when alargenewcanoe isfinished, and isforthe

charms which, substantially thesame incharacter with these,
assist thosewhoknowthem orpayforthem, orelseinjur>or
obstruct their enemies. Inprospect ofafight,forexample,
besides hisamulets and stones, aman intheBanks' Islands

infusion ofverybitter herbs andbark;andbychewingother
leaves andpuffingforth their magicinfluence would dis-
hearten anapproaching enemy.

often thesamemenwho cause them, themana derived from
spiritsandghosts beinginboth cases theagent employed;
but itoftenhappensthatthedarker secrets ofthemagicart
arepossessed andpractised onlybythose whose powerliesin
doing harm, andwho areresorted towhen itisdesired to
bringeviluponanenemy.Their secrets, like others con-
nected with mana, arepassed down from onegenerationto
another, andmaybebought. Themostcommon workingof
thismalignantwitchcraft isthat, socommon among savages,
inwhich afragmentoffood, bitofhair ornail, oranything
closely connected with thepersontobeinjured,isthemedium
through which thepoweroftheghostorspiritisbroughtto
bear. Some relic such asabone ofthedeadperson whose
ghostissettoworkis,ifnotnecessary, verydesirable for
bringinghispowerinto thecharm;andastonemayhave
itsmana fordoingmischief. What isneeded isthebringing
togetherofthemanwho istobeinjured andthespiritor
ghost who istoinjure him;thiscanbedonewhen some-
thing whichpertainstotheman'spersoncanbeused, such as
ahair, anail,aleafwithwhich hehaswipedtheperspiration
from hisface,andwithequaleffectwhen afragmentofthe
foodwhich haspassedintothemanforms thelinkofunion.
Hence inFlorida when ascrap from aman's meal could be
secreted andthrown into thevunuJia haunted bythetindalo
ghost,themanwouldcertainlybe ill;and intheNew
Hebrides when themaesnake carried awayafragmentof
food intotheplacesacred toaspirit,themanwhohadeaten
ofthefoodwould sicken asthefragment decayed.Itwas
forthis reason aconstant care toprevent anythingthat
might beused inwitchcraft fromfallinginto thehands of
ill-wishers;itwastheregular practicetohide hairandnail-
parings, andtogivetheremains offoodmostcarefullytothe
pigs1
.IntheBanks' Islands thefragmentoffood, orwhat-

ever itmay be,bywhich aman ischarmed iscalled garata ;
thiswasmade upbythewizard with abitofhuman bone,
andsmeared with amagicdecoction inwhich itwould rot
away. Orthegarata would beburnt, andwhile itwas
burning-thewizardsanghischarm;asthegarata was
consumed, thewizard burningitbydegrees dayafterday,
themanfromwhom itcame sickened, andwould die,the
ghostofthemanwhose bonewasburning would takeaway
his life. Ifthenanymanwhoknows hehasanenemyhas
reason himself tothink thatsomethinghasbeentaken from
him, orhisfriends hear that agarata fromhim isinsome
wizard's hands, heortheywillgivemoneytogetthe
fragmentback;andtheenemy again and hisfriends will
givemore tosecure thecontinuance ofthecharm. InAurora
thefragmentoffood ismadeupwith certain leaves;asthese
rotandstink theman dies. InLepers'Island thegaratais
boiled, togetherwith certain magical substances, inaclam
shell withcharms which callonTagaro.Itisevident that
noonewhointends tobringmischief toamanbyafragment
ofhisfood willpartakeofthatfood himself, because bydoing
sohewouldbringthemischief alsoonhimself. Hence a
nativeoffering even asingle banana toavisitor will bitethe
endofitbefore hegives it,andaEuropean giving medicine
toasick nativegivesconfidence bytakingalittle first
himself1
.
Another charm iscommon toboth eastern andwestern
islands, which iscalled intheBanks' Islands talamatai. A
bitofhuman bone, afragmentofcoral, asplinterofwood, or
ofanarrow bywhich aman hasdied,isbound upwith the
leaves which havemana forthepurpose,with themanasong ;
bythismeans thepoweroftheghostisbound into the
charm, andthetalamatai issecretly plantedinthepathalong

that thevirtue ofitmay spring*outand strike himwith

thecharm ischanted iswhatgives themagic power, and if

.The talamatai wasmade butlatelyinYaluwa in
Saddle Island;butthewizard who tied the lastbrought
out allhismagic apparatusbefore thepeopleofhisvillage
andsmashed itwith anaxe. InLepers' Island thesame
thingiscalledrango.
Another remarkableengineofmischief iscalled inthe
Banks' Islandstamatetiqa, ghost-shooter. Since this isused
also inFlorida itmaybesupposedtobecommon toallthese
islands. Abitofbamboo isstuffed withleaves, adeadman's
bone, andothermagical ingredients,theproper manasong
being chanted over it.FastingintheBanks' Islands, butnot
apparentlyintheSolomon Islands, addspowertothisand
other charms. Themanwhohasmade orbought oneofthese
holds itinhishand, with theopen end ofthebamboo

seethewound inhisheadwhere hewasstruck, andinhis
sidewhere hewas shot, andknow what hashappened
tohim.
Thepracticeofmagicarts formischief isintheBanks'
Islands andinLepers'Island calledgaqaleva, and isalways
dreaded incase ofsickness. InLepers'Island thewizards
whopractiseitarebelieved tohave thepower ofchanging
theirshape. The friends ofanyonesuffering from sickness
arealwaysafraid lestthewizard who hascaused thedisease
should come insome form, asofablow-fly, and strike the
patient;theysitwithhim therefore andusecounter-charms
toguard him,anddrivecarefully awayallflies, lesthisenemy
should come inthat form. Somemenbygaqalevacanturn
intoashark and eatanenemy,ormorecommonly some one
whom hisenemyhashired thewizard todestroy. Thestoryof
Tarkeke shews thisbelief inAurora also,where, asinLepers'
Island andinPentecost, magiciansturn intoeagles andowls
aswell assh'arks. Thispowerisnotalwaysused formalicious
ends, aswasshewn byMolitavile atLepers'Island. Avessel
'
recruiting labour/ called bythenatives a'
thief-ship/ had
carried awaysomepeoplefrom theisland, and their friends
wereveryanxious toknow whathadbecome ofthem. Moli-
tavile, whohadthepowerofchanginghisform, undertook
toturn himself intoaneagleandflyafter the vessel. He
told allthepeopleofthevillageinthe firstplacetokeep
away from that side oftheopen space between thehouses
from whence hewould take hisflight. Then heentered


2o8 Magic. [CH.
into ahouse decorated with cocoa-nut fronds, andthey
sawnomore;buttheyknew that hedrank thekava he
hadprepared,andthenlaydown tillhissoulwent out
ofhim intheform ofabirdandfollowed theship.After
awhile heemergedfrom thehouse, and told thepeople
that allwho hadbeen carried away were well but one,
whowasdead. Long1afterwards, when some ofthosewho
were thenonboard returned, theysaidthathehadbrought
back thetruth, oneofthembythattimehaddied.
(4)Dreams. Thenative belief astothenature ofdreams,
and astothepart played bythesoul ofmen indreams,
isasubjectofenquirywhichbelongsrather tothegeneral
questionastotheconceptionsthepeople have ofthenature of
thesoul itself andofhuman life;buttheuseofdreamingas
abranch ofthepracticeofmagic comesappropriatelyinto
view inthisplace.InMaewo, Aurora, intheNew Hebrides,
thedreaming-man,tatuaqoreqore, whomaybealsoinother
waysagismanainhisuseofsupernatural power,isinrequest
incases ofsickness. Inanordinary case,when itissupposed
that aghostisthecause ofthecomplaint, thefriends ofthe
sickmansend fortheprofessionaldreamer andgivehimnow
tobacco, asformerly theygave mats, tofindoutwhatghost
hasbeen offended, andtomake itupwith him. Hesleeps,
andinhisdreamgoestotheplace where thesickman has
beenworking;there hemeets some one, likeanoldman itis
likely,ofsmall size,whoreallyisaghost, andhelearns from
himwhat ishisname. Theghosttellshimthatthesickman
ashewasworkinghasencroached uponhisground,theplace
hehaunts ashisown,andthat topunish himhehastaken

Thedreamer begsforthereturn ofthesoul,andaskspardon
onbehalf ofthesickman,whomeant nodisrespect ;theghost
pullsupthefence inwhich thesoul isenclosed, andlets itout;
theman ofcourse recovers. These dreamers areable alsoto
visitMalanga, anabode ofthedead. Sometimes ifachild is
sick itissupposedthatthere issome oneinMalanga drawing
awayitssoul. Theconjectureisthatthesouloftheinfant is

infactthat ofsome onewhohasdiedandgonetoMalanga,
buthasafterwards desired tocome back toearth, andhasbeen
born astheinfant thatnow issick;and,moreover, thatthe
mother inMalanga,notwishing-tolosethesocietyofher
child there,isdrawingback there-born infant's soul. The
dreamerhavingreceived hisfeegoesinadream toMalanga,
andintercedes with themother there;hegetsback thesoul,
andthechild recovers. InSaa alsointheSolomon Islands,
ifachild starts initssleepitisbelieved thatsomeghostis
snatching awaywhatmust becalled intranslation itsshadow.
Awizard doctor undertakes togoinsleep andbringitback;
hedreams andgoes ;ifthosewhohavetaken the'shadow'let
himtake itback thechild recovers, but ifthechild diesthe
dreamerreportsthattheywould not lethimcome nearthem.
Inthesameplacewhen athingislostawizard isengagedto

hidden crime somewizard whounderstands howtodoitdrinks
kava, and sothrows himself into amagic sleep. When he
wakes hedeclares thathehasseentheculpritandgiveshis
name.
(5)Prophecy. Theknowledgeoffuture events isbelieved
tobeconveyedtothepeople byaspiritoraghost speaking
with thevoice ofaman, oneofthewizards, who ishimself
unconscious while hespeaks.InFlorida themen ofavillage
would besittingintheir kiala^ canoe-house, anddiscussing
some undertaking, anexpedition probablytoattack some
unsuspecting village. Oneamong them,known tohave his
own tindaloghostofprophecy,would sneeze andbeginto
shake, asignthatthetindalo hadentered intohim;hiseyes
wouldglare,hislimbs twist, hiswhole bodybeconvulsed,
foam would burst from hislips ;then'avoice, nothisown,
would beheard inhisthroat, allowingordisapprovingofwhat

ghost ;itcameuponhim, ashebelieved himself, atitsown will,
itsmanaoverpowered him,andwhen itdeparteditlefthim
quiteexhausted. Still aman towhom thishappened, when
hehadareputationasaprophet, would beemployedtoassist

inthecouncil andmake thatabranch ofhisprofessionasa
wizard. Thedescriptionofprophecy giveninSanCristoval
isidentical withtheforegoing1
.InSaa,menwhoarepossessed
with alioaprophesyofthingstocome. InLepers'Island
itisbelieved thatthespirit Tagaro putshispowerasaspirit
intoaman, manag, sothathespeaks what otherwise hecould
not, inthewayofforetelling thingstocome, aswell asof
making known what isconcealed. Theseprophetsarecon-
sulted when anew gamali, thehouse oftheSuqe Society,
istobebuilt, toknow ifthere willbepeaceorwar;because
anumber ofpeople assemble forsuch apurpose, and ifthere is
dangeroffighting theywillnotleave their homes.
(6)Divination. There aremany methods bywhichghosts
andspiritsarebelieved tomakeknown tomenwhousethem
the secretthings which theunassisted humanintelligence
could notfindout;andsome ofthesehardlyneedperhapsthe
intervention ofawizard. These methods ofdivination differ
verylittle inthevarious islands. IntheSolomon Islands,
inFlorida forinstance, when anexpeditionhasstarted ina
fleet ofcanoes, there issometimes ahesitation whetherthey

heasks therefore thequestion,'Shallwego?shallwego

tion iscalled gogondo. Theoperator whoknows thisarttakes

belonging-toeach tindalo, inwhich themana ofeach resides.
With these hegoestotheplace sacred tohisgogondo, andthe
peopleinterested assemble. Then hetiestheleaves tohis

andtheother Banks' Islandstheydivinedbymeans ofabam-
boointowhich aghosthad entered, andwhichpointed of
itself tothethief orotherculprittobediscovered. Acommon
method ofdivination intheBanks' Islands iscalled soilo,and
isused toenquire where alostpersonorthingistobefound,
who isthe thief, whether anabsent friend isalive ordead.
Thehands arelifted over theheadandrubbedtogetherwith
amagic song calling onaghost. Thesignisgiven bythe
crackingofthejoints ;when thequestionisoflifeordeath,,

boothey saywould runabout with amanwhohad itlying

(7)Ordeals. Toclear ortoconvict amanaccused ofguilt
there areordeals managed bymenwithwhom themagicin-
struments, andtheknowledgeofthecharms bywhich they
canbeused, remain. There areseveral ordeals used atSaa
whichmaystand asexamples from theSolomon Islands. One
iscalled thedaufieu, stoneworking,theknowledgeofthe
useofwhich ispassed down fromman tomanwith themagic
stone which isemployed. Anaccusedperson goestotheman
who hasthestone andengages him toundergotheordeal.
Thepeopleassemble andtheaccused denies thecharge, and
hesubmits tothe ordealthroughhiscompurgator. The
latter heats thestone andthrows itfromhand tohand;if
hishands arenotburnt theaccused ispronounced innocent,
andpaysaporpoise-toothfee. There ismuchpreparation
with averyyoung cocoa-nut, theflower ofsugar-cane and
chanted charms tomake theproceeding saka, hot,withsuper-
naturalpower.Itisprobablethatsometimes theaccusers
make theirpreparationsalsowith abribe. Another consists
intheapplicationofalightedbundle ofcocoa-nut fronds to
thelegsoftheaccused, whostands upforitoristiedbetween
twoposts.This isdonewithcharms bythemanwhomanages
it,andalsogetshis fee. Inanother theaccused swallows a
charmed stone heated bythewizardemployed,and isinnocent
ifhetakes noharm. Inafourth theaccused eatsabitofa
cocoa-nut which hasbeenmadeverysaka forthepurpose,
andbroken inpieces ;ifheisguilty hefallsafterwards from
atree orsome other accident befalls him, orhepines away.

Another method istotakealmonds from asacredplaceand

;theaccused eatsand isjudged

because ithasdogs'teeth uponit.This isplaced onthe
head oftheaccused andhesays,'IfIdidthething, mayI
diewith thisspear ;'ifheisguilty hesickens and dieswith
thepowerofthespear. There isalsoaverysacredsong,
verysaka. Thewizard whoknows itsings it,andtheac-
cusedmansays,'Well, thatsongisforme;ifIdidthat let
meandmychildren suffer.'Finally,there isthealligator
ordeal, used inthepassage between Mala Paina andMala
Masiki, where thereptilesarevery numerous. Aman ac-
cused ofserious crime istaken there;thewizard whomanages
theordeal callsthealligators with hischarms, andtheaccused
who isconfident inhisinnocence andinthewizard's power
dares toswim across. Noone willholdhimguiltyifhe
escapes.Inthis ordeal also itissometimes nottheaccused,
butthemanwhoknows thecharm whosubmits himself to

asheprotectsinfighting anyyoung manwhom hepreserves

ineither case issoughtforwith theappropriatecharm.
(8)Poison. Tothebest ofmyknowledgetheMelanesian
peoplewere notacquainted with theuseofanysubstance
which, when taken with food ordrink, would beinjurious by
itsnaturalproperties,untiltheylearnt theuseofarsenic from
Queensland. Returned'labourers'
broughtthatback with
them, andused itwith fatal effect inthesamewayinwhich
nativepoisonersused theirown magical preparations, by
mixingitinfood;and itismore thanprobablethat the
certain and fatal effect wasbelieved then tobeduetothe
powerful magicalandnotnaturalpowerswithwhich itwas
endued. Atany rate, ifwhat nativemagicians employedin
poisoningfoodhadanynaturallynoxiousqualities (whichis


214 Magic. [CH.
notdenied),itwasnotanynaturallynoxiousproperty which
wasexpectedtoproducetheinjuriousresult;norwhen
mischief followed was itascribed tothenaturalqualityof
what hadbeen administered;themagic charms hadinnative
belief thepowerofpoisoning,andcommunicated ittothe
preparationwhich wasmixed with thefood.Nodoubt the
materials overwhich thepoison charm wassungwere such as
seemed tohave acertain congruity with the effect tobe
produced. The secrets ofpoison-making have notbecome
known;butinFlorida itisbelievedbythepeoplethatthe
liver ofablack snake dried inthesunoroverafirewasthe
chiefingredientinthepoisons which were used there. There
were certainpersons whoknew the art,andwere hired to
poison withmaomao, made with themanapowerofthetindalo
ghost belongingtothesorcereremployed, andmixed inthe
food ofthemanwhose lifewasaimed at.TheSavopeople
weregreat poisoners;Florida menwho visited them were
careful what theyate.The effect ofthepoison wasthatone
whohadtaken itfell sick, vomited, andafterwards died.
Thepracticeofthis artwasdangeroustothepoisoner;a
knownpoisoner wasputtodeath inFlorida, and sowere
manyinnocentpersons suspectedoraccused. IntheBanks'
Islands topoison wastovangan pal,tofeedbystealth. The
Ureparapara peopleinthatgroup hadthereputeofbeing
poisoners,others wouldgetpoison from thence;inMota no
oneknew the art. InLepers'Islandpoisoniscalled, bya
parallel expression,aruwana;allthat Ihave learnt ofitis
thatthepreparationofitisvery secret, andthat itismade
withcharms inthesamewaywiththegarata above described.
Infactthecorrespondence between thenativepoison andthe
charm thatworks destruction throughafragmentoffood is
complete:intheonecaseaportionofthefoodalready eaten
bythepersontobeinjuredismixed with certainmagically
powerful substances; intheother themagically powerful
substances aremixed inthefood tobeeaten. Ineither case,
accordingtothenative belief, themischief wascausedby
magic. Aman eating away from hisclosest friends was in


xii.] Taboo.215
equalfear lest lieshould becharmed throughafragmentofhis
food orpoisoned bywhat mightbeputinto hisfood. The
poisoned arrows, ofwhich more hereafter, have never been
found tohavebeenprepared withanything which could bepro-
perlysaidtobepoison ;andundoubtedlythedreaded powerof
sucharrows togivefatalwounds wasbythenatives believed
tobeduetothemagic charms with which theyweremade,
andtothedeadman's bonewithwhich theywerepointed.
(9)Tapu and Curses. Theword taboo isoneofthevery
fewthatthelanguagesofthePacific Ocean havegiventothe
English language;andsomethingofitsmeaningtherefore
maybesupposedtobeunderstood. Butthetapuortambu of
Melanesia isnotsoconspicuousinnative lifeasthetapuof
Polynesia ;and itdiffers alsoperhapsinthis,that itnever
signifies anyinherent holiness orawfulness, butalwaysa
sacred andunapproachablecharacter which isimposed.This
isnotstrictlyaccurate asregardstheword intheSolomon
Islands, where everythingconnected with aghostofworship,
tindalo, lio'a, or'adaro,istambu ofitself;itisaccurate ascon-
cerns theBanks' Islands andNew Hebrides, where what is
inherentlysacred isrongo orsapuga. But stillincaseswhere
theEnglish word taboo canbeemployedthere isalwaysin
Melanesia human sanction andprohibition. Something,

powerofthechief, inthisandineverything else, restsonthe
persuasionthatthechief hashistindalo athisback. The
sense ofthisintheparticularcase isremote, theapprehension


216 Magic. [CH.
ofangeringthechief ispresent and effective, buttheultimate
sanction isthepowerofthe tindalo. Ifacommon man

people would think thathewould notdoitunless heknew
thathehadthepowertodoit;theywould watch, and ifany
onewho violated histambu were tofallsick,hewould be
recognizedatonce asonewhohadapowerful tindalo, andhe
would rise. Each tindalo hashisspecial leaf,andaman will
sethistambu with theleafofhis tinclalo asamark;mendo
notalways know whose leaf itis,buttheyknow thatthey
have todealwith atindalo, notonlywith aman,iftheydis-
regardthemark. Thetambu istooconvenient aninstitution
todropwhen theoriginalsanction ofithasceased tooperate ;
anative Christian teacher therefore doesnothesitate,asa

afraid ofaman ifnotofatindalo. IntheBanks' Islands
there isaminorprohibition, soloi, aswell asthemore solemn

natural sanction. Butamanbyvirtue ofthesupernatural

Stronger thananyindividual sanction wasthat ofthesecret

ofapigormoney would appease theindividual orsociety

Itisevident thatatambuapproachesto,acurse,when itis

Thus atSaa, afewyears ago,thechief forbade theyoung

Christian teachers, though reallyinsomedangeroftheirlives,
refused toacknowledgethepowerofthe lio'aandofthecurse,
andwouldgivenothingtothechief,whothereupon professed
himselfquite unable toremove thecurse.
Acursebywayofasseveration isverycommon inFlorida,
andnodoubt intheother Solomon Islands. Aman willdeny
anaccusation byhisforbidden food, butonggu!bysome tindalo,
Daula, theghostly frigate-bird,orBagea, theghostlyshark.
The Floridapeople, and theirneighbours probably, were
sufficientlyadvanced togarnishtheir conversation withprofane
andfilthy swearing, even before 'contact with civilization'
put
into their mouths those words which aretoooften the first
theylearn ofEnglish.Iamnotaware oftheexistence ofthis
habit intheBanks' Islands. Themore serious curse there is
tovagona,tomake into atangle,toprohibit easyaccess

CHAPTEE XIIT.
POSSESSION. INTERCOURSE WITH GHOSTS.
ITisdifficult toseparatethepracticeofmagicartsfrom the
manifestation ofaghost'sorspirit's powerinpossession;because
amanmayusesomemagic means tobringthepossession upon
himself,as"inthe case ofprophecy, and alsobecause the
connexion between theunseen powerful beingandtheman,
inwhatever waytheconnexion ismade andworks,isthat
which makes thewizard. Yetthere isadistinction between
thewitchcraft andsorceryinwhich bymagiccharms thewizard
bringstheunseen powerinto action, andthespontaneous mani-
festation ofsuchpower bytheunseen being; eventhough
theremaybeonlyafewwhocaninterpret,ortowhom the
manifestations aremade. Inacase ofmadness thenative
belief isthatthemadman ispossessed.There isatthesame
time aclear distinction drawn bythenatives between the
actsandwords ofthedelirium ofsickness inwhich astheysay
theywander, andthose which areowingtopossession. They
aresorryforlunatics and arekind tothem, thoughtheir
remedies arerough. AtFlorida, forexample, oneKandagaru
ofBoliwent outofhismind, chasedpeople,stolethingsand
hidthem. Nooneblamed him,because theyknew thathewas
possessed byatindaloghost.Hisfriends hired awizard who
removed thetindalo, andherecovered. Inthesamewaynot
longagoinLepers'Island therewasamanwho losthissenses.
Thepeople conjecturedthathehadunwittinglytrodden ona

doctors were called in;theyfound outwhoseghostitwasby
calling onthenames ofdeadmenlikelytohavebeen offended,
theywashed himwithwatermade powerful withcharms, and
theyburned thevessel inwhich themagic water hadbeen
under hisnose;hegotwell. Inasimilar casetheywillput
bitsofthefringeofamat,which hasbelongedtothedeceased,
into acocoa-nutshell, andburn itunder thenose ofthe
possessed. There wasanother manwhothrew offhismaloand
wentnaked atafeast, asuresignofbeingoutofhismind;he
drew hisbow atpeople, and carriedthingsoff.Thepeople
pitied him,and tried tocurehim. When aman insuch
condition inthat islandspoke,itwasnotwith hisown voice,
butwith that ofthedeadmanwhopossessed him;andsuch
amanwould know wherethings were hidden;when hewas
seencoming menwould hide aboworaclub totryhim,and
hewouldalways know where tofind it.Thus thepossession
which causes madness cannot bequite distinguishedfrom that
whichprophesies,andamanmaypretendtobemad thathe
may getthereputationofbeingaprophet. AtSaaaman
willspeakwith thevoice ofapowerful man deceased, with
contortions ofthebody which come uponhimwhen heis
possessed;hecallshimself, and isspokentobyothers, by
thename ofthedeadmanwhospeaks through him;hewill
eat fire, liftenormousweights, and foretell thingstocome.
IntheBanks' Islands thepeople make adistinction between
possession byaghostthat enters aman forsomeparticular
purpose, and thatbyaghost which comes fornoother
apparentcause than thatbeing without ahome intheabode

Such amanwould somewhere seeaghost, comehome and lie

Then hewouldbegintoweep, and tellthem thathehadcome

notdulycared for,orthat hisproperty wasbeingwasted.
Hewould scold hisrelatives fortheir misconduct, andhewould
tellthem ofthings theydidnotknow, such aswhere lost

Althoughthis isnotdonebywitchcraft aman isheld re-

Heremaybementioned alsocertain tricks whichghosts or
spirits playonmen, orwhich menknowhow tomakethem
play. AtMota intheBanks' Islands alittle boynamed
Peitavunana, heavenly water, wasfrightened andchased bya
ghost upthemountain. Hewassoughtforinvain,anda

announced thathewould befound inacertainveryinaccessible

excrement, thefoodofghosts,andstreaming with blood from
thethorns through which hehadbeen forced, and inhis
handanunripefruit ofthemammy-apple. Hesaidthat his
dead mother hadcome tohimandgiven himthe food.
Another littleboy,Nungwia, sleeping onthebeach atnight,
wasconveyed byaghostinto averysmallcavitybeneath a
rock, intowhich itwasimpossibleforhim tohave climbed.
InLepers'Islandtheyhave awayofplaying with aghost.

they singthattheywishnottoreturn intothepath,andthey

Inthesamewayaclub isputatnightinto acycas-tree,
which hasasacred character, andwhen thename ofsome

about, andputupintoatreewould liftthem from theground.
This resembles agooddeal amethod ofdivination used at
Motlav, anddescribed above, butthere isnodivination in
these tricks.
There was,andperhapsstillis,intheTorres Islands some-
thingsimilar tothis,whenghosts influenced and took
possessionofpeoplewith theuseofsticks. This hasbeen
described byanative under thename ofNatametlingalinga^
bywhich name thosewhoaresubjectedtotheghostlyinfluence
arecalled. Itisdone, hewrites, onthefifthdayafter adeath.
There wasacertain man atLowhotook thelead,andwithout
whom nothingcould bedone;hegaveoutthathewould
descend into Panoi, theabode ofthedead,andhehadwith
himcertain others, assistants. Heand hispartywere called
simply'ghosts'when engagedinthe affair. The firstthing
was toassemble thosewhowerewillingtobetreated ina

with charms. Then theleader andhisassistants went into all
thesacredplaces whichghosts haunt, such aswhere men
wash offtheblack ofmourning, collectingastheywent the
ghosts andbecomingthemselves somuchpossessedthatthey
appearedtohave losttheir senses, though they acted ina
certain method. Inthemeanwhile thesubjects lyinginthe
gamal begintobemoved;thosewhobringasthey saythe
ghoststothem goquietly alongboth sides ofthehouse with-
out,and allatonce strike thehousealongitswholelength
with thesticksthey carryintheir hands. This startles those
inside, andtheyrollabout onthegrounddistracted. Then
the'ghosts'enter inwith their sticks, andinthisperformance
each isbelieved tobesome onedeceased, oneTagilrow,another
Qatawala;they leapfrom side toside,turningtheir sticks
over tobebeatenbythesubjects onone sideandtheother.
Thesubjectsaregivensticks forthispurpose,and asthey

samewayatSaa ifaman sneezes when hewakes, hecries,
'Who callsme 1Ifforgood,well;ifforevil,maySo-and-So

CHAPTEE XIV.
BIRTH. CHILDHOOD. MARRIAGE.
INattemptingtotrace thecourse ofaMelanesian life
from birth toburial wesoonmeet withpracticesconnected
with theCouvade. Aproper Couvade hasperhaps been
observed inSanCristoval alone, when theyoung1father was
foundlyinginafter thebirth ofhischild;and itshould be
observed that thiswaswhere thechild follows thefather's
kindred. There ismuch however whichapproachesthis. At
Saa itisnotonlytheexpectant mother who iscareful what
she eats, thefather alsoboth before and after the child's
birth refrains fromsome kinds offoodwhich would hurt the
child. Hewill noteatpig's flesh, andheabstains from
movements which arebelieved todoharm, upon theprinciple
that the father's movements affect those ofthe child.A
man willnotdohard work,liftheavy weights, orgooutto
sea;hekeeps quietlestthechild shouldstart, should over-
strain itself, orshould throw itself about ashepaddles.In
theBanks' Islands also, bothparents are careful what
theyeatwhen thechild isbom, theytakeonlywhat iftaken
bytheinfant would notmake itill;before thebirth ofher
first child themother must noteatfishcaught bythehook,
net, ortrap.After thebirth ofthe firstchild, thefather
doesnoheavywork foramonth;after thebirth ofanyof
hischildren, hetakes carenottogointo those sacredplaces,
tanorongo,intowhich thechild could notgowithout risk.
Itisthesame intheNew Hebrides; theexpectant Araga

child's birth, anddoesnotenter hishouse;after thebirth, he
doeswork inlookingafter hiswifeand child, buthemust
noteat shell-fish andotherproduceofthebeach,forthe
infant would suffer from ulcers ifhedid. InLepers' Island,
thefather isverycareful fortendays;hedoesnowork, will
notclimb atree, orgofarintotheseatobathe,forifhe
exerts himself the child will suffer. Ifduringthistime
hegoestoanydistance, astothebeach, hebrings backwith
him alittle stonerepresentingtheinfant's soul,which may
have followed him;arrived athome, hecries,'Come hither,'
andputsdown thestone inthehouse;then hewaits tillthe
child sneezes,, andhecries,'Here itis,'knowing then that
thesoulhasnotbeen lost.
Abortion andInfanticide wereverycommon. Ifawoman
didnotwant thetrouble ofbringing upachild, desired to
appear young,wasafraid herhusband might think thebirth
before itstime, orwished tospiteherhusband, shewould find
someonetoprocureabortion either bythejuiceofcertainplants
taken indrink orbytwistingandsqueezingthefoetus. Infan-
ticide wasmoreprevalentinsome islands than others;since
Christianteachinghasbeenintroduced agreatchangeisvisible
inMaewo, Aurora Island, and atWangoinSan Cristoval,
where thebirth ofaninfant wasoflateyears indeed anun-
usualthing, and allthechildren inthevillages hadbeen
boughtfrom inland. Inthosepartstheoldwomen ofthevil-
lagegenerallydetermined whether anewborn child should live;
ifnotpromisinginappearance,orlikelytobetroublesome,it
wasmadeaway with,itsmouth perhapsstuffed with leaves and
thebodycastintoaholeandcovered with astone. Inthe
Banks' Islands,ifofthewrongsexorotherwise unwelcome, the
infant waschoked assoon asborn. Male children were killed
rather thanfemale inthatgroup ;ifthere werefemale children
already,another would notbedesired;butthefemales were
ratherpreserved,asitisimportanttoobserve, because ofthe
family passing throughthefemale side, aswell aswith the
prospectofgainwhen thegirlshould bebetrothed andmarried.
There isnowhere inthegroups generallythepracticeof


230 Birth. Childhood. Marriage. [CH.
killingoneoftwins, nor isthere anywhere anydislike tothe
birth oftwins further thanfrom thetroubletheyentail. In
someplaces,asatSaa,twins areliked;atMotlav thepeople
ofavillageareproudoftheir twins, andtheparents and
relations makemuch ofthem;noonewouldadopt oneof
them, because itwouldspoilthepleasureofseeing them
together,anddeprive them oftheir naturalrighttobe
together;theonlysadthingabout them isthatthey give
much trouble, andthattheparentswillbesosorryiftheydie.
InFlorida alone there seems tobesomethingofasuspicion
thattwofathers maybeconcerned;buttheytake itthatthe
woman hastrespassedonthesacredplace, vwnuka, ofsome
ghost, tindalo, whose powerliesthatway.InLepers'Island
also itisthoughtthat twins maybeagiftofTagaro.
Women whowant achild willgotoasacredplaceinhope
that thespiritwillgivethem one,andsometimes hegives
them two. There isnow intheisland oneMalavaiboe, Pig-
twin, thesurvivor oftwin sonsofArusese;thepeople believe
hewillturn outagreat man, notsomuch because heisa
twin, asbecause Tagaro gavethetwins ofwhich heisoneto
theirmother when shewent toaskachild.
AtSaa,when anewborn infant iseightortendaysolda

clearlyinthisamovement towards thepatriarchal system,a
recognitionofthetieofblood throughthefather andofduties
that follow from it.Anothersignofthesame advance ofthe
father'srightistobeseen intheverydifferent custom that
prevailsintheBanks' Islands onthebirth ofafirst-born son;
there israised uponthat event, anoisy andplayful fight, vagalo,
afterwhich thefather buysofftheassailants withpaymentof

claim ofthemother's kinsfolk tothechild asoneofthemselves,
andthefather's paymenttobethequietingoftheir claim and
thesecuringofhisownpositionashead ofhisownfamily.
Aschildren grow theyremain intheir tenderyearsinthe
women's carewithin thehouse. Theyarecommonlyweaned
when theycancrawl. Their firstadvance inlifewhen they
areboys depends verymuch uponthecustom oftheplace
concerning clothing.IntheBanks' Islands, where males of
anyagewore nothing, boysastheygrew bigger were sent to

'He isaboy,itistime toseparate himfrom thegirls.'

assumed with afeast andkilliDgofapig. Theboy'sas-
sumptionofadress dependstherefore ontheability and
willingnessofhisfriends toprovidethe feast,andsomebig
boysgonaked. The dress intheNew Hebrides, atLepers'
Island, andPentecost differs little from that ofSanta Cruz.
Theboyputsonhismalo dresswhen hisparentsthink him

must notuseasacommon noun thewordwhich isthename

hisname ascarefully. Hemaygotohisfather's house toask

doorand eat. Ifbychance brother and sister meet inthe
pathsherunsawayorhides. Ifaboyonthesands knows
that certainfootstepsarehis sister's, hewillnotfollow them,
norwill she his. Thismutual avoidancebegins when the
boyisclothed orthegirltattooed. Thepartition between
boysandgirlswithout which aschool cannot becarried onis
notthere todivide thesexesgenerally,buttoseparatebrothers
and sisters. This avoidance continuesthroughlife.The
reserve between sonandmother increases astheboygrows

buthasnotthis character. AtSanta Cruz themenand
women never worktogether promiscuouslyorassemble in
onegroup ;menwith their wives andchildrenonly,andmen
with their mothers, work inthegardens; when acrowd

Swallowgroup,theseparationiscomplete;menandwomen
arenever outtogether;inthemorningthemengoout

Ithasbeen said inChapters VandVIthat there isnot
known inthese Islands ofMelanesia anyinitiation or'making
ofyoung men'
;there isonly theentrance intothevarious
societies. Thenearestapproachtosuch initiation seems tobe
found atSaa.Achief's soninthatpartofMalantagoes

Considerablelaxityofintercourse betweenboys andgirls

There isbuttoogoodacausegenerallyforthenatives to.

inSan Cristoval and intheneighbourhood girlswere very

friends take thepigs, mats, anduncooked food,and setthem
down inthemiddle ofthe bride'svillage. The bride's
friends have already preparedcooked food, andthetwo
partieseattogether;themarriageisthuscomplete. The
bride iscarried onsomeone's back tohernewhome, wrapped
inmany mats, andwith palm-fans heldabout herface,because
she issupposedtobemodest andshy. Formerlythere was
alwaysahouse built beforehand, andfoodpreparedforthe

ifsatisfaction were refused aquarrel would ensue.Anewly-
married husband, withoutwaiting-forobservations, would
often beat hisbride tomake herconfess who herparamour
hadbeen.
The oldhabits ofthepeopleinalltheislands werevery
strict inregardtoadultery. Thepunishment oftheman
wasdeath;butthepunishment wasverygenerally mitigated
onpaymentofafine. Thus inFlorida aninjured husband
would givemoneytothechief tohave theadulterer killed,
andhe,ifhecould, would make satisfaction inmoneytoboth
chiefandhusband, andsosave his life.Thewoman, however,
would probablybemade arembi, harlot, fortheprofitofthe
chief. AtSaaanadulterous wife isdismissed, and the
adulterer ispunishedwith death, exile, orfines. Incase of
adulteryinachief'sfamilyhewillhave theadulterer killed,
orreceivingalargefinewill lethimgotoUlawa andlive;
aman's friends willsometimes hidehim foratime, hoping
thatthechief willconsent totake afine,and iftheyfindhim
implacable,will killtheman themselves orgivehimup.
When thewronghasbeendoneamonglesser men, thefriends
ofthehusband andoftheadulterer willoftenfightabout the
damagestobeexacted;andfrom thiscause indeed most of
thefighting throughoutallthegroups proceeds. Achief of
Saa,Ulawa, Ugi,orSanCristoval, whohashadtheadulterer
killed, makes abea,astagefrom whichspeechesaremade,
andrewards thosewhohave killed him;and forhimself at
Saahemakes the sacrifice toto 'akalo(page 137),toclear
away anydangerthatmayhappentohim asthecause of
death. IntheBanks' Islands andNorthern New Hebrides
thetreatment ofadulteryisvery simple ;theman isshot or
clubbed bythehusband orhisfriends intheir firstindig-
nation, andthewoman isbeaten, scolded, andthreatened with
death, butthematter iscompromised very generally by
paymentofmoneyandpigs.Awifejealousofherhusband,

times togetback arunawaywife before hegivesher

DEATH. BURIAL. AFTER DEATH.
THAT death isthepartingofsoulandbody, andthatthe
departedsoul continues inanintelligent andmore orless
active existence, iswhat Melanesianseverywhere believe;
butwhat that iswhich inlifeabides with thebody, andin
deathdepartsfromit,andwhich, speakingofitinEnglish,
wecallthe soul,theyfind itverydifficult toexplain. Like
people verymuch more advanced than themselves, theyhave
notinthe firstplaceaperfectlyclearconceptionofwhat itis;
and inthesecondplace,likeotherpeople, they usewords to
representtheseconceptions whichthey acknowledgetobe
more orlessfigurativeandinexact, when theprecise meaning
ofthem issoughtfor.Nor isitanywonder that, believing
thatsuch athingaswhatwecallasoul exists inconnexion
with thebodywhichthey see,theyspeakofandconceive of

hasalikeness tothatwhich isthoughtofoffers itsname asa

people who callthesoulashadow, Idonotinthe least
believe thatthey think theshadow asoul orthe soul a

individual andinseparable from him, but unsubstantial.
TheMota wordweuseforsoul isinMaori ashadow, but


248 Death. Burial. AfterDeath.[CH.
noMotamanknows that itevermeant that. Infactmy
belief isthat intheoriginal languagethisword didnot
definitely mean either soulorshadow, buthadameaning one
canconceive butnotexpress, which hascome outinone
language meaning shadow, andintheother meaning some-
thinglike soul,i.e.second self1

always readytoassume thatthesavagetakes achildish view
andhasabsurd beliefs, when allthewhile, ifthesavagecould
puthim toaclose examination, hisownconceptions would
befoundveryindistinct and hisexpressions mainly figur-
ative. Manyavoyager,notanobserver, carries awayasa
sortofjokethestorythat thenatives think their shadows
aretheir souls,who could not tellexactly what hemeans
bytheword'soul'which heuses himself. Itmaysuffice
tomake thestatement that, whatever word theMelane-
sianpeopleuse forsoul, theymean something esseutially
belongingtoeach man's nature which carries lifetohis
bodywithit,and istheseatofthought andintelligence,
exercisingtherefore power which isnotofthebody and is
invisible initsaction. Further understandingoftheir con-
ceptionscannot well failtofollow from thestudyofthe
words theyuse.
Ithasbeenshown(page121)thatamongMelanesians there
isauniversal belief intheexistence ofpersonal intelligent
beingsofpower superiortothat ofmen,andwithout bodies
such asarethebodies ofmankind;andthat thesebeings,
whom wecallspirits,aredistinct from thedisembodiedspirits
orsouls ofdead'menwhich wecallghosts.Itisnotsur-
prising, therefore, that thesamewordwhich isused forspirit

Theuseoftheword ataiinMota seemsproperly andorigin-
allytohave been tosignify something peculiarlyand
intimatelyconnected with aperson andsacred tohim,some-
thingthathehassethisfancy uponwhen hehasseen itin
what hasseemed tohimawonderful manner, orsome onehas

secondself,thevisibleobjectsomysteriouslyconnected with
theman,andtothis invisible second selfwhich wecallthe
soul. There isanother Mota word, tamaniu, which hasalmost
ifnotquite thesamemeaning1asataihaswhen itdescribes
something animate orinanimate which amanhascome tobe-
lieve tohaveanexistenceintimatelyconnected with hisown.
Theword tamaniu maybetaken tobeproperly'likeness/ and
thenounform oftheadverb tama, as,like. Itwasnotevery
oneinMotawhohad histamaniu;onlysomemen fancied
thattheyhadthisrelation toalizard, asnake, oritmightbe
astone;sometimes thething wassoughtforandfound by
drinkingtheinfusion ofcertain leaves andheaping together
thedregs ;thenwhateverliving thing was firstseen inor
upontheheapwasthetamaniu. Itwaswatched butnotfed
orworshipped;thenatives believed that itcame atcall,and
thatthe lifeofthemanwasbound upwith the lifeofhis
tamaniu, ifaliving thing,orwith itssafety;should itdie,or
ifnotliving getbroken orbelost, themanwould die.
Hence incaseofsickness theywould send toseeifthetamaniu
wassafeand well. Thisword hasnever been usedapparently
forthesoul inMota;butinAurora intheNew Hebrides it
istheaccepted equivalent.Itiswellworth observingthat
both the ataiandthetamaniu, and itmaybeadded the
Motlavtalegi,issomething which hasasubstantial existence
ofitsown, aswhen asnake orstone isaman's ataiortamaniu;
asoulthenwhen called bythese names isconceived ofas
somethinginawaysubstantial. There isanother word used
inMota, neverappliedtothesoulofman,butveryillustrative
ofthenativeconceptions,andcommon alsotoAurora, where it
isusedwith aremarkable application;thisword isnunuai.
InMota itistheabidingorrecurrent impressiononthe

word isnodoubt thesame asniniai, shadow orreflection,
meaningnotshade, which ismalumalu, butthedefinitefigure

formed byreflection inthewater. There isnoconfusion in
thenative mind between ashadow andareflection, butthey
usetheoneword todescribe that definite individual something
which, itself insubstantial,issocloselyconnected with the
substance thatgivesitform.
Thisword, intheform nunu,isused inAurora todescribe
thefancied relation ofaninfant tosome thingorpersonfrom
which orfromwhom itsoriginissomehow derived. Awoman
before herchild isborn fancies that acocoa-nut, bread-fruit,
orsome suchthinghassomeoriginalconnexion with her
infant. When thechild isborn itisthenunu ofthecocoa-nut,
orwhatever itmay be,andasitgrows upitmustbynomeans

anyrealconnexion inthewayofparentage,butthechild isa
kind ofecho. There isanother wayinwhich achild isthe
nunu ofapersondeceased. ThusArudulewari isthenunu ofa
boywhom hismother brought upandwhowasmuch beloved
byher. Thisboydiednotlongbefore Arudulewari wasborn,
andthen themother believed thatherfoster-child hadwished
tocome back toher,andthattheinfant was bisnunu. But
Arudulewari isnotthatperson, nor, ashesays,ishissoul

thattheyhavenoother word.
We arenowpreparedtofollow thecorpseofthedead

theprincipal objectofworship, occupies,ashasbeenshewn, a
much higher placeinthereligiousworld ofthenatives than
itdoes intheislands which lietotheeastward, andonthat
account itisdesirable, beforeentering upon details, todraw
thedistinction between thetwo classes ofghosts which is
generally recognizedintheformer islands. Thedistinction is
j
between ghostsofpowerandghostsofnoaccount, between
those whosehelpissought andtheir wrathdeprecated,and

InSavo, nearby,common men arethrown intotheseaasa

house hiscloth, hisaxes, spears, shield, andotherproperties,
heaping yamsandother foodupon theground. Atthefeast

ThestoryoftheOriginofDeath noticed intheaccount
ofSaa(page 260),has itsparallelintheBanks' Islands and
againintheNew Hebrides. At firstmennever died, but
when theyadvanced inlifetheycast their skins likesnakes
andcrabs, andcame outwithyouthrenewed. After atimea
woman growingoldwent toastream tochangeherskin;
accordingtosome shewasthemother ofQat,accordingto
others Ul-ta-marama, Change-skinoftheworld. Shethrew,
offheroldskin inthewater, andobserved that asitfloated
down itcaught againstastick. Then shewent home,
where shehad leftherchild. The child, however, refused to
recognize her,cryingthat itsmother wasanoldwoman not
likethisyoung stranger ;andtopacifythechild shewent after
hercastintegument andputiton.From thattimeman-
kind ceased tocasttheir skins and died. Inanother Banks'
Islandstorythiswoman isIroPuget,Bird's-nest Fern, the
wife ofMate, Death \There aremanyothers. Inonethe
cause oftheintroduction ofDeath wastheinconvenience of
thepermanenceofpropertyinthesame hands whilemen
changedtheir skins and lived forever. Qattherefore sent
forMate, whodwelt inPanoi, orbythesideofavolcanic
vent inSanta Maria, andassured him thathewould only
have togotoVanua Lava andnotbehurt. Death there-
forecame forth;theylaidhimonaboard, killed apig,and

andeatthefuneral feast. Onthe fifthdaywhen theconch
wasblown todriveawaytheghost, Qatopened thecovering
overMate andfound himgone;nothingbutbones remained.
Inthemeanwhile TangarotheFoolhadbeen settowatch
thewaytoPanoi, where thepaths tothelower andupper
worlds divided,lestMate should gobelow;thefool satin
front ofthewaytotheworld above, andletMate godown
toPanoi;allmenhave since followed Deathalongthatpath.
Anotherstorymakes thesame fool under hisname of
Tagilingelingethecause ofdeath, because when IroPuget
sethim toguardthewaytoPanoi inprospectofherown
death, hepointedoutthatwaytoherdescending ghost
instead ofthewayback totheworld, andsoshe,and allmen
after her, diedandnever came back tolife. InLakona,
partofSanta Maria, thestory goesthatMarawa stole a
woman whom Qathadmade(page 157);andinthenight
while heandsheweresleeping Qatcamequietly, pulledout
their teeth, andshaved their heads. Then hetookthehairy
plexusofthetree-fern andputitontheir heads, givingthe
names ofbaldness andofthe'second hair/ asgrayhairhas
since been called. Then hespread spider's web over their
eyes,sothatwhen theywoke inthemorningdimness was
over theirsight. Thewoman refused togoback tohim;so
inasonghecalled forbaldness, blindness, toothlessness, old
age,anddeath, because shehaddisobeyedhisword.
The soul, atai ortalegi, goesoutofthebodyinsome

isfound dead inthemorning ;when aman faints, mate mule,

friends would notmake itknown,lestthosewhom hehad
oppressedshould come andspitathim after hisdeath, or

watch thegraveofamanwhose lifewasbad, lestsomeman

Theghostwhen itleaves itsformerdwelling-place makes
itswaytoPanoi, towhich there aremany entrances, called
sura, inthevarious islands, some underground andunknown,
some wellknown, liketherock Aliali onthemountain at
Mota, volcanic vents ontheburninghillGarat over the
lake atGaua, andthegreat mountain ofVanua Lava, the
Sur-lav, greatsura. Theghosts congregateonpointsofland
before theirdeparture,aswell asatthemouth ofthesura,
where theyareheard dancing, singing, shouting andwhistling
with land-crabs' claws onmoonlight nights. Tothesepoints
oflandandthesura entrances toPanoi itwaspossiblefor
ghosts whohadalreadydescended toreturn, and itwas
thought bysome that they would come outtoreceive,
sometimes with dancing,thefreshly dead, shewthem their
various haunts, andconduct them totheunderworld. There
isalsothenotion thatthere aresuraappropriatedtoparticular
classes ofghosts;asthesuretupa, wheresimpleharmless
people congregate,andthesurelumayav, whereyouths gowho

Thisfancy wasmostlythatofwomen, whothought much of
allwhodiedyoung, andabove allofthosewhohadbeen shot

Aprecise andconsistent account ofthecondition ofghosts
after theyhave arrived atPanoi, andofthatplace itself, is
difficult indeed toobtain from thenatives ofthisgroup;nor

perhapsisitreasonable toexpectit.But the stories of
descents toPanoi shew intheir relation what arethecommon
conceptionsinthenative mind. Itdoesmuch toreconcile
thevarying-accounts torecognisethetruth thatPanoi isnot
asingle receptaclethesame for all,andthat there isa
correspondingdistinction between one class ofghosts and
another. This isclearlybelieved atMotlav, wherethey say
thatwhen aghost goesdown thesura itismetbyanother
ghost, andaccordingtothecharacter oftheman inlife is
allowed toenter into Panoi, orsentback toanotherplace,
dreading which itgoestowander ontheearth. The true
Panoi isagood place, andthere isabadplacebesides which
issometimes meant when theword Panoi isused. Thus, ifa
manhaskilled another bytreacheryorwitchcraft, when after
death hedescends thesurahefinds himself withstood atthe
entrance toPanoi bytheghostofthemanhehaswronged;
heseesanother path leadingtothebadplace hedreads, andso
heturns back toearth. Ifonehaskilled agoodmanwithout
cause, thegoodman'sghostwithstands hismurderer;ifone
manhaskilled another infairfighthewillnotbewithstood
bytheman heslew;ifabadman slew abadmanboth
would betogether,butnotinthetruePanoi. This division
isvery importantthat there aresomeghosts who enter
Panoi, andsomewho arenotallowed toenter, these last
beingofbadcharacter. Very importantindeed also isit,as
shewingnative notions ofmoralright andwrongsooften
denied tothem, toobserve what sortofmenwere admitted
andwhowere refused. Whowastheman ofgoodcharacter

these aretheywho eatexcrement andopentheirmouths for
wind;these aretheywhodoharm totheliving outofspite,
who aredreaded aseating men'ssouls,whohaunt thegraves
andwoods. There isasingularbelief atLakonaconcerning
thiskind ofjudgmentafter death. Theghost's pathleads
him tothevolcanic vents oftheburninghillGarat, andashe
runsalongtheghosts assemble toreceive him. Theybeat
him,ghostashealready is,todeath, then cuthim topieces,
and eachghostwill take apiece. They then puthim
together again, and ifhehasinhislifetimewrongfullyshot
thefather, brother, orsogoi relation ofanyoftheghostsinto
whose hands hehas fallen, ordoneanyotherwrong,the
ghostwhohasthegrievancewillhide thepieceofhimthat
hehastaken;hewillremain withsomepartofhim deficient,
andwhen hegoesdown toPanoi andtheghostsaskhim
what hasbecome ofthat bitofhim,hewill tellthem that
some onehaskeptitfromhimbecause hehaddonehim
wrong.
Theghostofavasisgona,awoman whohasdied inchildbed,
cannot gotoPanoi ifherchild lives, forshecannot leave her
child. Theytherefore deceive herghostbymaking uploosely
apieceofabanana trunk inleaves, andlayingitonherbosom
when she isburied. Then, asshedeparts,shethinks shehas
thechildwith her;asshegoesthebanana stalkslipsabout
intheleaves andshethinks thechild ismoving;andthis in
herbewildered new condition contents her,tillshegetsto
Panoi andfinds that shehasbeen deceived. Inthemean-
while thechild hasbeentaken toanother house, because they
know thatthemother willcome back totake itssoul. She
seeks everywhereforthechild ingriefandragewithout
ceasing ;andtheghostofavasisgona therefore isparticularly
dreaded.

Descents toPanoi have beenbynomeans uncommon.
There wasawoman, whodiednotmany years ago,whoonce
much desired toseeherlatelydead brother; sheperfumed
herself withwater inwhich adead rathadbeensteeped,to
giveherself adeath-like smell, pulled upabird's-nest fern,a
puget, anddescended bythehole shehadopened. Shehad
nodifficultyinfinding Panoi, andshesawfriends therewho
weresurprisedtoseeher,andnever discovered that shewas
alive. Shefound herbrotherlyinginahouse, because asa
recent ghosthewasnotstrong enough yettomove about.
Hecautioned hertoeatnothing there, andshereturned.

TheOriginofDeath wasascribed atLepers' Island, both to
thedisuse ofthepowerofchangingtheskin,andtothedefect
ofnature which hadnotgiven menthatpower. Onceupon
atime awoman andacrabdisputedthepoint,thewoman
maintainingthatthecrabwasbetter than men,changingits
shell, becoming young again, andliving long. Shewanted
thecrab tochangebodies with her;andsheblamed Tagar
because hedidnotmakemenrightly. But inaccordance
with thestorywhich istoldinvaryingforms intheSolomon
Islands, theBanks'group, andtheNew Hebrides, menhad
informer times thepowerofchangingtheir skin. There was
anoldwoman whohadtwograndchildren. These twoboys
were onedayplayingatblocking back thewater ofalittle
brook, when thestream brought down aTahitian chestnut. One
oftheboystook it,andgaveittohisgrandmothertoroast.
Afterwards theotherboy,whohadatfirstdespisedthechestnut,
ranhome unobserved andate it,sothatwhen thefirstboywent
foritthechestnut wasgone. Theboyscolded hisgrandmother
forneglect, and she,angryinherturn, saidtotheboys,'You
twodon't wish toliveforever,butwould rather thatweshould
not live.' Shehadjustcome backfromchangingherskin in
thewater higher upinthestream which theboyswereblocking


284 Death. Burial. After Death.[CH.
back;andtheyhadseenthecast-off skin, pickeditupwith a
stick, andthrown itoutofthewater. Theoldwoman inher
angerfollowed thestream down totheplace where herskin
waslying onthebank, andputitonagain. Since that
timemankind haslostthepowerofchanging skins, and all
have died.
Atdeath the soul, tamtegi, departs from thebody. When
itiscertain that itisgonethewailingfordeathbegins.
At first thetamtegi doesnotgofaraway, andthere are
sounds which shew itspresence;they never drive itaway,
itisonlythesoul ofonewhohasbeen eaten that isdriven
offwith theblowingofconchs;when thetimecomes itgoes,
andthetime isahundreddays. Thecorpseisburied

diedtheywrapped him atonce inmats, andadded more

InMota theword siqpa wasappliedatonce toEuropean

shifted thevowels insiapo, hiapo (theMaori hiako, bark),the

DANCES. MUSIC, GAMES.
(i)Dances. Itmaybeconfidentlyasserted that inthe
Melanesian islands here inview dances haveabsolutely no
religiousorsuperstitious character, althoughvisitors find
'devil dances'and*devil grounds'
enough. Menandwomen
always danceapart ;thesongswhich accompanythedances
areundoubtedly some ofthem indecent, and Iwould byno
means denythat there areindecent dances, thoughInever
heard ofthem. There mightbethoughttobeasuperstitious
character inthose dances inwhich theperformersaresup-

Parties ofmenpractisethese dances tilltheyareperfect,

(2)Songs. Words fitted tomusic arethesongs andpoetry
ofthepeople;thecharacter ofthetunesdiffering more in
thevarious groups andislands than thegeneralcharacter of
thewords. There isnoconceptionofpoetry without a
tune, thoughtunes without words arenotunknown. In
songscertain words orforms ofexpression,which arenot
used incommonspeech,areeverywhere thought poetical and
appropriate, andwords arelengthenedorshortened tofit
whatmust becalled themetre. IntheBanks' Islands the
useofadistinctsong-dialectisvery remarkable, inwhich not
onlyarewords used which arenever used inspeech, some
probablyarchaic andsome borrowed from aneighbouring
island, andnotonlyarewords contracted orprolongedtosuit
thetune, butineach island thesong-languageissodifferent
from that ofordinary speechthat thetwohave theappear-
ance oftwodialects, ascompletelyasintheDialogue and
Chorus ofaGreekplay. Thedifference isleastconspicuous
inGaua, Santa Maria, mostconspicuous probablyinMota.

(3)Musical Instruments. Thedrum, inmany forms,maybe
said tobethe characteristic instrument ofMelanesia, yet
there seems tobenouseofsuch athinginFlorida, and
perhaps noknowledgeofanative drum inSanta Cruz. The
common form ofdrum isrepresented byajointofbamboo

theform ofthedrums which aremade oflogsoftrees. In
these thetrunk ofatreeofasuitable kindand size ishollowed

MISCELLANEOUS.
(i)Cannibalism. Itmaybesafelyasserted that inthe
Banks' Islands andSanta Cruz there hasbeennocannibalism,
thoughthenatives werenotignorantofthepracticeofitby
others. When somefifty years agoapartyofmenfrom
Tonga,asitisremembered, leftthe little island ofQakea, on
which theyhad forashort time settled, theproofsthatthey
hadeaten thosewhomtheyhadkilled inthefightingwhich
precededtheir departurecaused such horror andrage against
them that aparty returningayearafter tothesameplace
wasimmediatelyattacked. IntheSolomon Islands itis
strangethat thepracticehasrecentlyextended itself. Itis
asserted bytheelder natives ofFlorida thatman's fleshwas
never eaten exceptinsacrifice, andthatthesacrificingofmen
isanintroduction oflatetimes from further west. Thecoast
peopleofBugotu saythesame ofthemselves;butthey freely
accuse theinlandpeopleofthesame island, withwhom they
have agooddeal offreeintercourse, andwhose speechisnot
verydifferent from theirown, ofbeing cannibals, andofkilling
men forthesakeofeating them.Afewyears agooneNunu,
aninland chief, wasbelieved tosaythatpig'sfleshwasbad
andman's fleshsweet tohim;amanwhohadmounted tohis
placeandfound himself inasweat would sitdown tocool
before heshowed himself;Nunu took thesweat asasignof
fatness, andwould desire toeathim. InUlawa, again,there


344Miscellaneous.[CH.
isnoeatingofmen;itisthoughtthatthelio'a,theghostsof
power,donotlike it;andatSaa itwasnottheoldcustom of
theplace,theeldermenevennow willhavenothingtodo
with it.Theyounger menhave taken toit,and eatthe
bodies ofmen killed inbattle;they have followed the
custom ofmenfrom theeastern coastwhohave lived with
them, andoftheBauro men ofSan Cristoval whom they
have visited. Thenatives ofSanCristoval notonlyeatthe
bodies ofthosewho areslain inbattle, but sellthe flesh.
Tokill forthepurposeofeating humanflesh, though not
unknown, israre,and isathing which marks themanwho
hasdone it.This isasubject onwhich stories which come
from traders arenotvery trustworthy. IntheNorthern
New Hebrides there isnodoubt cannibalism. Iknow
nothingabout itinAurora, buthave been toldbyan
eye-witnessofwhat isdone inPentecost. After abitter
fight theywould takeaslainenemy andeathim, asasignof
rageandindignation;theywould cookhim inanoven, and
eachwould eatabitofhim,women andchildren too.When
therewasalessbitterfeeling, theflesh ofadeadenemy was
taken awaybytheconquerorstobecooked andgiventotheir
friends. Intheneighbouring islands, and attheback of
hisown island, saidmyinformant, theykill forthesake of
eating.InLepers'Islandtheystill eatmen. Itwasnotthe
common fashion, however, toeatenemies killed infairfight-
ing,itwasamurderer orparticularlydetested enemy whowas
eaten, inanger,and totreathim ill;such aonewascooked
likeapig,andmen, elderwomen andboysatehim. The
boyswere afraid, butweremade todo it.Itisthefeeling
there that toeathuman flesh isadreadfulthing,aman-
eater isoneafraid ofnothing ;onthisground men willbuy
fleshwhen some onehasbeenkilled, thattheymaygetthe
name ofvaliant menbyeatingit.Acertain man inLepers'
Island mourned many daysforhisson,andwould noteat till
heboughtapieceofhuman flesh forhimself and hisre-
maining boy ;itwasahorridthingtodo,appropriatetohis
gloomy grief.


xviii.] Heads.Castaways. 345
(2)Heads.Head-huntingisnotpractised byanyofthe
natives eastwards from Ysabel; that istosay,theydonot
makeexpeditionsforthesolepurposeofobtainingheads. In
Bugotu, thesouth-easternextremityofYsabel, thepeople have
suffered and still suffer mostseriously from theattacks ofthe
head-hunters frombeyond, whoseexpeditions, followingthe
coasts from agreat distance, andsometimes formonths, have
reached Malanta andGuadalcanar, inonemostdisgraceful
instance thehead-hunters being broughttoFlorida inan
Europeanvessel. Thepractice, however, oftakingheads and
preserving them assignsofpower andsuccessbelongstothe
Solomon Islandsgenerally. Theheads ofenemies killed in
fightarepreservedastrophies, and setoutonstagesasin
Florida, orhungupunder theeaves ofthecanoe-house asin
SanCristoval. When achief intheexercise ofhisauthority
hadaman killed foranoffence, orhadhimmurdered outof
revengeorhatred, orforasacrifice, headded thehead tohis
collection;itwasasignofhispowerandgreatness. Hence,
asthemore heads hecould show themore hispower wasin
view, hewasready onevery opportunityandonanypretext
totakealifeandahead. When achiefhadaman killed, he
would keep thehead, butsentthelegsandarms tohisneigh-
bours, toshewwhat hehaddone. If,forexample, anaccused
mangotawayfromMboli inFlorida toSavo, theMboli chief
would send arequest, backedbyapresentofmoney,tothe
Savo chief tohavehim killed;theSavo chief would keep
theheadandsend alegorarm toFlorida, where thechief
wouldhangituptoshew hispower. Theheads thustaken
andpreservedaredistinct from those ofdeceased relatives,
which arekeptasmemorials ofaffection. Skulls may be
seensuspended equallyattheentrance ofaSolomon Island
okaandaNew Hebrides gamal, butthesignification is,in
allcasesprobably,distinct.
(3)Castaways. Astrangerassuchwasgenerally through-
outtheislands anenemytobekilled. Thus atFlorida a
stranger whohadescaped from awreck ontoanisletwas
killedwhen seen,andspokenofasacocoa-nut thathadfloated


346 Miscellaneous.[CH.
ashore. There wasacommon belief that astranger would
bring withhim disease orsome other mischief. But itwas
often aquestion whether acastaway wasastranger.Ifhe
wererecognisedasbelongingtoanhostiledistrict, therewas
nodoubt ofhisfate;but ifhefellintothehands ofthose
towhose division, kerna orveve,hebelonged, hewouldprob-
ablybesaved. Itisanotuncommonthing that canoes
should beblown from Santa Cruz andtheReef Islands to
Malanta andUlawa;themen onboard them were not
wholly strangers, though personally unknown;theyweremen
andfromknown lands, notstrange beingslikewhitemen
from without theworld.Theywere therefore received as
guests, sometimesestablishing themselves after awhile by
marriage, sometimeswaiting anopportunitytoreturn.
Many single canoes from time totimehavebeenblown away
fromPolynesian islands, andhave drifted totheBanks'
Islands;inmanycases thecastaways havebeenkindly treated,
andhave added astrain tothenative race. Within the
lastforty yearsmenfromTikopiahave twice been most
kindly received atMota.
(4)Slaves. There isnosuchthingasslavery properlyso
called. Inhead-hunting expeditions prisonersaremade for
thesake oftheir heads, tobeusedwhen occasionrequires, and
suchpersonslivewith theircaptorsinaconditionvery
different from that offreedom, buttheyarenottaken or
maintained forthepurposesofservice. Inthesame islands
when asuccessful attack andmassacre enriches thevictors
withmany heads, they spareandcarryoffchildren, whomthey
bring upamongtheirownpeople. Such asekawillcertainly
bekilled forahead orforasacrifice before anynative member
ofthecommunity,buthelives asanadopted member, shares
thework, pleasures, anddangersofthose withwhom he
dwells, andoften becomes aleading personage among them.
Arefugeeoracastawayisnotaslave butaguest;his life
isnaturally much lessvalued than that ofaman oftheplace,
and useful services areexpectedfrom him, while hemixes
freely andonequal terms with thecommonpeople.


xviii.] Burying andBurningAlive. 347
(5)Buryingalive.Nothing- seems moreinhuman than the
practiceofburyingsickandaged people alive, yetitis
certain thatwhen thiswasdone therewasgenerallyakind-
nessintended. Itistruethatsometimes therelatives ofthe
sickbecame tired ofwaiting upon them, andburied them
whentheythought theyoughttobereadyforit;buteven
insuch cases thesickandaged acquiesced.Itwascommon
forthem tobegtheir friends toputthem outoftheirmisery.
Someyears agoaman atMota buried hisbrother, whowas
inextreme weakness from influenza;butheheapedtheearth
looselyover hishead, andwent from time totime toask
himwhether hewere still alive. Oflateyears, thoughold
peopleaskforit,their friends willnotconsent. Notlong
agoinPentecost, awoman after alingeringsickness inatime
offamine was buried, andwasheard forthreedays crying
inhergrave. InLepers'Island thepatient wassometimes
strangled, with hisownconsent1
.
(6)Burningalive. This hasonlybeen heard ofatAraga,
Pentecost Island. Infightingtime there, ifagreatman
wereveryangry with thehostileparty, hewould burn a
wounded enemy. Whenpeacehadbeenmade, andthechiefs
hadordered alltobehave wellthat thecountry mightsettle
down inquiet,ifanyonecommitted such acrime aswould
break upthepeace, such asadultery, theywould tiehim toa
tree,heapfirewood round him,andburnhimalive, aproof
totheopposite partyoftheir detestation ofhiswickedness.
Thiswasnotdonecoollyasamatter ofcourse intheexecu-
tion ofalaw,butasahorrible thingtodo,anddone forthe
horror ofit;ahorror renewed inthevoice and face ofthe
native who toldmeoftheroaring*flames and shrieks of
agony.
1Inthesame island, inthebushcountry,therewasagreatmanwhohad
apoor brother. Inatime offamine thepoorman stole food, notaskingfood
from hisbrother, ortakingitfrom him. Thechief buried hisbrother alive,
inspiteofhisown wife'sentreaties, andthepoorman'ssupplications ;he
bound him,dugagrave, putmats init,threw himinandburied him. The
actwasshockingtotheopinion oftheislanders, but itmarked agreatman
whowould dowhat hechose.

(7)HeavenlyBodies. There isnoappearanceofabelief
thatanyheavenlybodies areliving* beings ;intheBanks'
Islands theSunandMoon arethoughttoberocks orislands.
InLepers'Island thestoryistold that theSunandthe
Moonquarrelledwhile theSunwasmakingamash ofwild
yam,andthathethrew themess inarageattheMoon's face,
onwhich thesplashesaretobeseen; butthis istoldwithout
anyserious belief. Itiscommonlybelieved that there isa
humanbeing, male orfemale, intheMoon. The stories of
Vulaninggela andKamakajaku shew thebelief inFlorida and
Ysabel that there isaperson whogoes with theSunand
whose name isSun,rather than thattheSun isaperson. In
Florida thename oftheMan intheMoon isNgava ;when
theMoon rises fullthey cry'There isNgava sitting.' Every

thesame sortofportent ;somegreatman will die,there will

closetogether,warue inLepers' Island, signifieswar. The
Solomon Islandspeoplearemore concerned about thestars
than their Eastern brethren, perhapsbecause oftheirlonger
voyages ;theSanta Cruzpeople andReef islanders excel all
therestintheirpractical astronomy. TheBanks' islanders
andNorthern New Hebridespeople content themselves with
distinguishingthePleiades, bywhich theapproachofyam
harvest ismarked, andwithcallingtheplanets masoi, from their
roundness, asdistinct fromvitu, stars. InFlorida theearly

(8)Months and Seasons. Themoon isnaturally the

mostnearlytothewordyear, signifiesaseason, and sonow

hapsintheNew Hebrides, makes aman listless andstupid.
Theplantused isnotindigenous ;there isindeed apepperof
thesamespecies verycommon, but itwillnotdoforthe
woana. There isacertain sacred character about theplant,
ashasbeenshewn, andtheuseofitisconfined tomen. The
introduction oftobacco intocommon useintheNorthern New
Hebrides andBanks' Islands isquite recent, butthepeople
arenowgiven uptotheuseofit.Smoking wasuniversal in
theSolomon Islands, atFlorida, Ysabel, andSan Cristoval,
thirty years ago,withmen,women, andinfant children, and
thetobacco wasgrown andprepared bythenatives;yetit
wasnotknown atSaaatthat time,where ithassince been
introduced from Arosi inSanCristoval, andtheeldermen at

thevarying qualityofthestory- tellingoftheindividual

Samuku lived inhisvillage, andbuilt hishouse, andworked,

married, andtheytwo lived well,andagreed perfectlywell
together, and worked, andmuch was their food. And
Samuku camehome andasked forfood, because hewas

muku wasangry with hiswife, and scolded hergreatly.
And hiswife saidtohim, Iamtired ofmakingfood foryou,

3.THEMIM. TORRES ISLANDS.
They say*that theMinipeople draggedtheyamsfrom
placetoplace, having brought them ashore atHiw, and
then dragged them toTugua,forwhich reason theyams
atHiwand atTuguaarevery large andlong. Butwhen
they dragged themalonghere toLo, allthepeople were
down onthe reefsfishingandheardnothingofit;nor


368 Siones.[CH.
didtheyknowanything-tilltheyfound therind ofthe
yams sticking-tothe roots ofthe treesalong1thepath.
These they picked upandplanted; andonthat account
theLoyamsarenotvery large,butplentiful enough.
Because theMinipeoplesliced theiryamsinhalf forthe
men ofHiwandofTugua,andthenpassed ontoToga,
and slicedagainforthem there, onwhich account theyams
there arevery large andlong.Afterwardstheycrossed to
Ureparapara, where thepeoplesliced theyams inhalfand
planted them. Theydidthesame inalltheislands that
way;itwasonlyatLothatthepeopledidnotseeandhear
whatwasgoingon.Thecrowns oftheyams remained and
wereplanted somewhere. TheMinipeople went dragging
theyams throughalltheislands, shouting andcallingtothe
men ofevery placetocomeand slicetheyams, andtake their
burden fromthem.
4.THEORIGIN OFPOISONED ARROWS. AURORA ISLAND.
Ihave often heardthemtellingthestoryabout itinthisway.
They saythat inoldtimes therewasnofighting. Butthere
wasanoldmanwhose name wasMuesarava, whowasblind
andused tostaydoing nothinginthehouse;andheheard a
pigeon calling, andtook abowandbroad-headed arrow and
went under thetree;andthepigeonletdropabitofthe
fruit itwaseating, andthatblindman shot ataventure into
thetree,andhitthepigeonwithoutseeingit.Andhetook it
up,andwent andputitintotheoventogether with the
yams, andsatdown andsangasong. Buttwoyoungfellows
came along andquietly openedthat oldman Muesarava's
oven, and ateuphispigeonwith some ofhisyams. Then
theywent toanotherplace, andsangback asongtohim;
andheheardit,andwent back toeathispigeon,butfound
when heuncovered theoven that itwaseatenup,andthat
somethingnotgood hadbeen putinitsplace. Then he
wasexceeding angry,andplottedafight againstthepeople
oftheplacewhence thetwoyoung menhadcomewhohad


xix.] Origin ofPoisoned Arrows. 369
stolen and eaten Muesarava's food. AndnowMuesarava
begantomakefighting-arrows ofmen's bones. Muesarava
wentandgrabbed upwith hishands aboywhohaddied,and
took hisbones, andbeatthem tosplinters andrubbed them
sharp. But hisenemies ontheir sideknewnothingofthat,
they onlycutwood intoshape,orbones offishorbirds, and
fixedthem intheir arrows, while Muesarava onhisside
prepared men's bones. Andwhen theyfought theyshot at
himand hit,buthedidnotdie;andheshotthem andthey
could notlive, but diedoutrightallofthem. Andthey
fought again andshot athim,and hithimandhedidnot
die;butMuesarava shot atthem and hit,andtheyalldied.
Soitoftenhappened, andtheysawthattheydied invery
great numbers;andtheyasked Muesarava whyitwasthat
theyshothimandhedidnot die,while heshotthem and
theyallofthem died. Therefore hetoldthem and said,
'Goandgrubuponeofthedeadmen Ihave shot,andscrape
hisbones, andpoint your arrows with that.' Uponthisthey
listened tohiscounsel anddidashehad said tothem;and
whentheyfought again theyshothim,andhestraightway
died.
And thatthing,thedead man's bone thatMuesarava
groundtoapointforhimself with hisown hand,still
remains, andhasnotyetbeenspoilt ;thereed-shaft hasbeen
spoilt andreplacedoverandoveragain, butthatdead man's
bone stillremains;Ihave seen itmyselfinmybrother's
possession ;itstillremains. Thepeoplethink agreatdealof
it,thinkingthat there issupernatural power, mana, inthat
totoarrow. Ifthere isheard arumour offighting, andthat
ispointedinthedirection whence itcomes, thefighting
comes tonothing.
