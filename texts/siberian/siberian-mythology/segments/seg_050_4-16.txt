SIBERIAN MYTHOLOGY
brate this feast three days after a birth, at which time the
goddess of birth is believed to depart. Flesh of the votive
animal is placed for the deity at the head of the bed, and
especially butter, a little of which each one present throws
laughing merrily into the fire; at the same time the women rub
their hands and faces with butter " in order to become fruit-
ful." In some districts, after the birth of a boy, a small tent
of birch-bark is made by the fireside, and horses and cows and
a bow and arrows made of the same material placed within it.
The intention of this magic ceremony is the developing of the
boy as a capable member of the community.12
