EDITOR'S NOTE
I
N place of a preface, Dr. Holmberg has asked me to say
that much in his account of Finno-Ugric and Siberian
Mythology is the result of personal acquaintance with various
tribes. In the summer of 1911 he lived among the heathen
Votiaks. In the summer of 1912 he travelled in Siberia (Dis-
trict Turuchansk) among the Siberian Arctic peoples. And in
the summer of 1913 he lived among the Cheremias.
