ern Voguls make the devil give the wife of the hero of the
flood a strong drink, by the help of which she entices her
husband to relate his secret. The Ostiaks call the man by a
name borrowed from the Tatars, Pairekse.4
A legend corresponding in all its details is known also to
the peoples of East Europe, where it is probably of literary
origin. It is to be found at least in the Russian version of the
Revelations of Pseudo-Methodius. With Russian settlers it
may possibly have migrated in this form to Siberia, where told
by these, it has been written down, e.g., in the territory behind
the Baikal. In its chief points, this Russian legend is as
follows: In order to find out why Noah is building his ark,
the devil advises his wife to prepare a strong drink, having
drunk of which Noah, in a state of intoxication, informs his
wife of the secret entrusted to him by God. The devil dis-
turbs Noah in his work, and when the ark is at last completed,
he creeps into it in the company of Noah's wife, who has
tempted her husband into pronouncing the devil's name. Ar-
rived in the ark, in the guise of a mouse, he gnaws holes in the
bottom of the ark.5
