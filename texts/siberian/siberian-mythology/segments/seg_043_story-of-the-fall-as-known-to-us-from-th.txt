story of the fall as known to us from the Bible. Only in
details does it differ from the latter. In the paradise of the
Bible, two trees are mentioned, the tree of life and the tree
of knowledge of good and evil, both growing in the centre
of paradise, the fruit of the latter being forbidden to man.
