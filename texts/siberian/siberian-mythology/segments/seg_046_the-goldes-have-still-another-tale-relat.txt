The Goldes have still another tale related to this. A
brother and sister lived in a hut in peace. Once when the
brother came home from the forest, he noticed that his sister
had altered considerably. He began to suspect that some one
kept company with her. For this reason, he strewed ashes
outside the hut when setting off again on a hunting-trip.
Returning the next morning, he was astounded to see the
foot-prints of a tiger in the ashes. He hid his suspicions,
however, until it became apparent that his sister was enceinte.
Then he decided to thrust a knife into her breast as she lay
murmuring shaman songs to herself. While singing she said:
" I have lived with the tiger, he is my husband, his spirit
is in mej thou canst not kill me, but if thou wilt cut off my
little finger, I shall die." The brother cut off his sister's
little finger and when she was dead, built a large log-fire and
threw the body on to it. While the body was burning, instead
of sparks, all kinds of evil spirits in the form of birds and
insects flew out of the fire.9
Cannibal myths of this description, which are to be found
also among the Tungus, and are extremely characteristic of
the more northern peoples of Siberia, have been noted down
also on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. As in Siberia,
North American Indian myths tell of the birth of blood-suck-
ing insects from the ashes of a man-eater.10 It seems prob-
able, therefore, that these primitive tales have a common
origin.
