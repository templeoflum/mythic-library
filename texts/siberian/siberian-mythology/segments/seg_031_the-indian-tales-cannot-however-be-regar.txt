The Indian tales cannot, however, be regarded as the model
for the Yakut tale mentioned. Their tree of life resembles

THE TREE OF LIFE 357
more the ancient Egyptian pictures, in which a date-palm de-
scribed as being partly a tree and partly a woman, gives to its
ward nourishment producing eternal life. Sometimes this
tree is seen pictured on the brink of the spring of the water of
life.18
The tree of life of the Yakuts with its goddess appearing
from the roots resembles also the Yggdrasil of the Icelandic
Eddat " Which is the greatest and best of all trees," whose
" branches cover the whole earth and rise over the heavens,"
whose " tall trunk is hidden by a white fluid " and which will
" stagger first when the world ends." Under this " openly
flourishing tree, dripping honey-dew" is a wonderful spring,
Urdarbrunn, beside which under the roots of the tree live the
three deities of birth and fate, the Norns. If we compare
Yggdrasil with the Yakut tree of life, it becomes obvious that
they are identical, even to their details, with the exception that
under the tree of life of the Scandinavian poem there are three,
and under the Yakut, only one goddess.
The eagle also of the Edda, which sits in the crown of the
tree, and the Nidhugg snake under its roots are details closely
connected with the tree of life of Central Asia. The Kalmucks
relate how a dragon in the sea at the foot of the Zambu tree
lay in wait for the leaves dropping from Zambu. The leaves
which it failed to catch, sinking to the bottom, turned into gold
there.1* In the Buriat poems a mythological snake called
Abyrga is said to dwell at the foot of the tree in a " lake of
milk." 1B In certain Central Asian tales the Abyrga snake
twines round the tree itself, while at the same time the Garide
eagle living in the crown attacks and pecks at it.18 This
Garide, which when flying furiously causes storms, is, as the
name indicates, the Indian Garuda, the well-known robber of
Soma.
