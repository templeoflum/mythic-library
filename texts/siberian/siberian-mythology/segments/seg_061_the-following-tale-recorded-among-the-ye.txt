The following tale recorded among the Yenisei Ostiaks is
instructive: When the first man died, his relatives believed him
to be asleep, but when they were unable to awaken him they
became afraid and started to cry. The Heaven god, Es, then
sent down a dog to tell them that they had no reason to be
afraid, but that they should bind up the body with grass and
hang it in a tree, when the body would come to life within
seven days. But the dog deceived the people into burying
the body in the ground. The result was that afterwards men
began to die.86
Cremation, which occurs among certain peoples in the north-
east corner of Siberia (the Chukchee and Koriaks) and also
among the Buriats, cannot have been one of the earlier methods
of disposal of the dead among the Altaic peoples. A later
custom is probably also the Mongol method of throwing a
body into the fields as food for the dogs/7
Side by side with the thought that the soul wanders after
death in the other world, the idea appears that the souls of the
dead may after a time be born again on the earth in a child
of the same family. The Yenisei Ostiaks believe that the
soul can take up its dwelling, or live again in some animal,
especially in bears, and also vice versa.2* This belief is not to
be confounded with that according to which the souls of the
dead are inclined to many temporary metamorphoses. A cer-

tain groping after explanations is already apparent in the view
laid down by a Buriat, according to which human beings have
three souls. One is taken captive by the Prince of Death;
the second remains as a ghost in this world, continuing to live
as before; the third is born again as a living person.29
