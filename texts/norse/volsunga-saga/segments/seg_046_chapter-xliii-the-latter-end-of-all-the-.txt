CHAPTER XLIII. The Latter End of all the Kin of the Giukings.

Now telleth the tale concerning the sons of Gudrun, that she had arrayed
their war-raiment in such wise, that no steel would bite thereon; and
she bade them play not with stones or other heavy matters, for that it
would be to their scathe if they did so.

And now, as they went on their way, they met Erp, their brother, and
asked him in what wise he would help them.

He answered, "Even as hand helps hand, or foot helps foot."

But that they deemed naught at all, and slew him there and then. Then
they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdir stumbled, and
thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spake therewith--

"Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen, had
not hand been to steady me."

A little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, and
so stood, and spake--

"Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with both feet."

And they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother.

But on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek, and they
went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cut both hands from
him and Sorli both feet. Then spake Hamdir--

"Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother, whom we slew on the
way, and found out our deed too late." Even as the Song says,--

     "Off were the head
     If Erp were alive yet,
     Our brother the bold,
     Whom we slew by the way,
     The well-famed in warfare."

Now in this must they turn away from the words of their mother, whereas
they had to deal with stones. For now men fell on them, and they
defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were the scathe of many
a man, nor would iron bite on them.

But there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed, (1)
and he spake--

"No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to their end."

Then the king said, "Give us rede thereto, if thou canst."

He said, "Smite them to the death with stones."

In such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast from every
side, and that was the end of their life-days.

And now has come to an end the whole root and stem of the Giukings. (2)

     NOW MAY ALL EARLS
     BE BETTERED IN MIND,
     MAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENS
     EVER BE MINISHED,
     FOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLE
     SO TOLD TO ITS ENDING.

APPENDIX: EXCERPTS FROM THE POETIC EDDA.


PART OF THE SECOND LAY OF HELGI HUNDINGS-BANE (1)

Helgi wedded Sigrun, and they begate sons together, but Helgi lived not
to be old; for Dag, (2) the son of Hogni, sacrificed to Odin, praying
that he might avenge his father. So Odin lent Dag his spear, and Dag met
Helgi, his brother-in-law, at a place called Fetter-grove, and thrust
him through with that spear, and there fell Helgi dead; but Dag rode to
Sevafell, and told Sigrun of the news.

     DAG:
     Loth am I, sister
     Of sorrow to tell thee,
     For by hard need driven
     Have I drawn on the greeting;
     This morning fell
     In Fetter-grove
     The king well deemed
     The best in the wide world,
     Yea, he who stood
     On the necks of the strong."

     SIGRUN:
     All oaths once sworn
     Shall bite thee sore,
     The oaths that to Helgi
     Once thou swarest
     At the bright white
     Water of Lightening, (3)
     And at the cold rock
     That the sea runneth over.

     May the ship sweep not on
     That should sweep at its swiftest,
     Though the wind desired
     Behind thee driveth!
     May the horse never run
     That should run at his most might
     When from thy foe's face
     Thou hast most need to flee!

     May the sword never bite
     That thou drawest from scabbard
     But and if round thine head
     In wrath it singeth!

     Then should meet price be paid
     For Helgi's slaying
     When a wolf thou wert
     Out in the wild-wood,
     Empty of good things
     Empty of gladness,
     With no meat for thy mouth
     But dead men's corpses!

     DAG:
     With mad words thou ravest,
     Thy wits are gone from thee,
     When thou for thy brother
     Such ill fate biddest;
     Odin alone
     Let all this bale loose,
     Casting the strife-runes
     'Twixt friends and kindred.

     Rings of red gold
     Will thy brother give thee,
     And the stead of Vandil
     And the lands of Vigdale;
     Have half of the land
     For thy sorrow's healing,
     O ring-arrayed sweetling
     For thee and thy sons!

     SIGRUN:
     No more sit I happy
     At Sevafell;
     At day-dawn, at night
     Naught love I my life
     Till broad o'er the people
     My lord's light breaketh;
     Till his war-horse runneth
     Beneath him hither,
     Well wont to the gold bit--
     Till my king I welcome.

     In such wise did Helgi
     Deal fear around
     To all his foes
     And all their friends
     As when the goat runneth
     Before the wolf's rage
     Filled with mad fear
     Down from the fell.

     As high above all lords
     Did Helgi beat him
     As the ash-tree's glory
     From the thorn ariseth,
     Or as the fawn
     With the dew-fell sprinkled
     Is far above
     All other wild things,
     As his horns go gleaming
     'Gainst the very heavens.

A barrow was raised above Helgi, but when he came in Valhall, then Odin
bade him be lord of all things there, even as he; so Helgi sang--

     HELGI:
     Now shalt thou, Hunding
     For the help of each man
     Get ready the foot-bath,
     And kindle the fire;
     The hounds shalt thou bind
     And give heed to the horses,
     Give wash to the swine
     Ere to sleep thou goest.

A bondmaid of Sigrun went in the evening-tide by Helgi's mound, and
there saw how Helgi rode toward it with a great company; then she sang--

     BONDMAID:
     It is vain things' beguilling
     That methinks I behold,
     Or the ending of all things,
     As ye ride, O ye dead men,
     Smiting with spurs
     Your horses' sides?
     Or may dead warriors
     Wend their ways homeward?

     THE DEAD:
     No vain things' beguiling
     Is that thou beholdest,
     Nor the ruin of all things;
     Though thou lookest upon us,
     Though we smite with spurs
     Our horses' sides;
     Rather dead warriors
     May wend their ways homeward.

Then went the bondmaid home, and told Sigrun, and sang--

     BONDMAID:
     Go out, Sigrun
     From Sevafell,
     If thou listest to look on
     The lord of thy people!
     For the mound is uncovered
     Thither is Helgi come,
     And his wounds are bleeding,
     But the king thee biddeth
     To come and stay
     That stream of sorrow.

So Sigrun went into the mound to Helgi, and sang--

     SIGRUN:
     Now am I as fain
     Of this fair meeting,
     As are the hungry
     Hawks of Odin,
     When they wot of the slaying
     Of the yet warm quarry,
     Or bright with dew
     See the day a-dawning.

     Ah, I will kiss
     My king laid lifeless,
     Ere thou castest by
     Thy blood-stained byrny.
     O Helgi, thy hair
     Is thick with death's rime,
     With the dew of the dead
     Is my love all dripping;
     Dead-cold are the hands
     Of the son of Hogni;
     How for thee, O my king,
     May I win healing?

     HELGI:
     Thou alone, Sigrun
     Of Sevafell,
     Hast so done that Helgi
     With grief's dew drippeth;
     O clad in gold
     Cruel tears thou weepest,
     Bright May of the Southlands,
     Or ever thou sleepest;
     Each tear in blood falleth
     On the breast of thy lord,
     Cold wet and bitter-sharp
     Swollen with sorrow.

     Ah, we shall drink
     Dear draughts and lovely,
     Though, we have lost
     Both life and lands;
     Neither shall any
     Sing song of sorrow,
     Though in my breast
     Be wounds wide to behold:
     For now are brides
     In the mound abiding;
     Kings' daughters sit
     By us departed.

Bow Sigrun arrayed a bed in the mound, and sang--

     SIGRUN:
     Here, Helgi, for thee
     A bed have I dight,
     Kind without woe,
     O kin of the Ylfings!
     To thy bosom, O king,
     Will I come and sleep soft,
     As I was wont
     When my lord was living.

     HELGI:
     Now will I call
     Naught not to be hoped for
     Early or late
     At Sevafell,
     When thou in the arms
     Of a dead man art laid,
     White maiden of Hogni,
     Here in the mound:
     And thou yet quick,
     O King's daughter!

     Now needs must I ride
     On the reddening ways;
     My pale horse must tread
     The highway aloft;
     West must I go
     To Windhelm's bridge
     Ere the war-winning crowd
     Hall-crower (4) waketh.

So Helgi rode his ways: and the others gat them gone home to the house.
But the next night Sigrun bade the bondwoman have heed of the mound. So
at nightfall, thenas Sigrun came to the mound, she sang:

     SIGRUN:
     Here now would he come,
     If to come he were minded;
     Sigmund's offspring
     From the halls of Odin.
     O me the hope waneth
     Of Helgi's coming;
     For high on the ash-boughs
     Are the ernes abiding,
     And all folk drift
     Toward the Thing of the dreamland.

     BONDMAID:
     Be not foolish of heart,
     And fare all alone
     To the house of the dead,
     O Hero's daughter!
     For more strong and dreadful
     In the night season
     Are all dead warriors
     Than in the daylight.

But a little while lived Sigrun, because of her sorrow and trouble.
But in old time folk trowed that men should be born again, though their
troth be now deemed but an old wife's dotting. And so, as folk say,
Helgi and Sigrun were born again, and at that tide was he called Helgi
the Scathe of Hadding, and she Kara the daughter of Halfdan; and she was
a Valkyrie, even as is said in the Lay of Kara.

PART OF THE LAY OF SIGRDRIFA (1)

       Now this is my first counsel,
       That thou with thy kin
     Be guiltless, guileless ever,
       Nor hasty of wrath,
       Despite of wrong done--
     Unto the dead good that doeth.

       Lo the second counsel,
       That oath thou swearest never,
     But trusty oath and true:
       Grim tormenting
       Gripes troth-breakers;
     Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows.

       This is my third rede,
       That thou at the Thing
     Deal not with the fools of folk;
       For unwise man
       From mouth lets fall
     Worser word than well he wotteth.

       Yet hard it is
       That holding of peace
     When men shall deem thee dastard,
     Or deem the lie said soothly;
     But woeful is home-witness,
     Unless right good thou gettest it.
       Ah, on another day
       Drive the life from out him,
     And pay the liar back for his lying.

       Now behold the fourth rede:
       If ill witch thee bideth,
     Woe-begatting by the way,
       Good going further
       Rather than guesting,
     Though thick night be on thee.

       Far-seeing eyes
       Need all sons of men
     Who wend in wrath to war;
       For baleful women
       Bide oft by the highway,
     Swords and hearts to soften.

       And now the fifth rede:
       As fair as thou seest
     Brides on the bench abiding,
       Let not love's silver
       Rule over thy sleeping;
     Draw no woman to kind kissing!

       For the sixth thing, I rede
       When men sit a-drinking
     Amid ale-words and ill-words,
       Dead thou naught
       With the drunken fight-staves
     For wine stealeth wit from many.

       Brawling and drink
       Have brought unto men
     Sorrow sore oft enow;
       Yea, bane unto some,
       And to some weary bale;
     Many are the griefs of mankind.

       For the seventh, I rede thee,
       If strife thou raisest
     With a man right high of heart,
       Better fight a-field
       Than burn in the fire
     Within thine hall fair to behold.

       The eighth rede that I give thee:
       Unto all ill look thou,
     And hold thine heart from all beguiling;
       Draw to thee no maiden,
       No man's wife bewray thou,
     Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure.

       This is the ninth counsel:
       That thou have heed of dead folk
     Whereso thou findest them a-field;
       Be they sick-dead,
       Be they sea-dead,
     Or come to ending by war-weapons.

       Let bath be made
       For such men fordone,
     Wash thou hands and feet thereof,
       Comb their hair and dry them
       Ere the coffin has them;
     Then bid them sleep full sweetly.

       This for the tenth counsel:
       That thou give trust never
     Unto oaths of foeman's kin,
     Be'st thou bane of his brother,
     Or hast thou felled his father;
     Wolf in young son waxes,
     Though he with gold be gladdened.

       For wrong and hatred
       Shall rest them never,
     Nay, nor sore sorrow.
       Both wit and weapons
       Well must the king have
     Who is fain to be the foremost.

       The last rede and eleventh:
       Until all ill look thou.
     And watch thy friends' ways ever
       Scarce durst I look
       For long life for thee, king:
     Strong trouble ariseth now already.
