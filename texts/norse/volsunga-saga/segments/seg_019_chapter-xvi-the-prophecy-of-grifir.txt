CHAPTER XVI. The prophecy of Grifir.

There was a man hight Grifir,(1) who was Sigurd's mother's brother, and
a little after the forging of the sword Sigurd went to Grifir, because
he was a man who knew things to come, and what was fated to men: of him
Sigurd asked diligently how his life should go; but Grifir was long
or he spake, yet at the last, by reason of Sigurd's exceeding great
prayers, he told him all his life and the fate thereof, even as
afterwards came to pass. So when Grifir had told him all even as he
would, he went back home; and a little after he and Regin met.

Then said Regin, "Go thou and slay Fafnir, even as thou hast given thy
word."

Sigurd said, "That work shall be wrought; but another is first to be
done, the avenging of Sigmund the king and the other of my kinsmen who
fell in that their last fight."
