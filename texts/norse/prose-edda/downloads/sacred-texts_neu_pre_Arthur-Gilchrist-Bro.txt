The Prose Edda
of Snorri Sturlson
Translated by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur [1916]
The Prose Edda is a text on Old Norse Poetics, written about 1200 by
 the Icelandic poet and politican Snorri Sturlson, who also wrote the
Heimskringla
.
 The Prose Edda contains a wide variety of lore which a Skald (poet) of the
 time would need to know.
 The text is of interest to modern readers because it contains consistent
 narratives of many of the plot lines of Norse mythology.
 Although Snorri was a Christian, he treated the ancient Pagan mythology
 with great respect.
 To this end, Snorri created a quasi-historical backstory for the Norse Gods.
 Hence the Prose Edda is of interest because it contains
 one of the first attempts to devise a rational explanation for mythological
 and legendary events.
 It is also notable because it contains fragments of a number of
 manusripts which Snorri had access to, but which are now lost.
