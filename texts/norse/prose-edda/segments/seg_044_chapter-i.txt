CHAPTER I.

This story about the ploughing of Gylfe reminds us of the legend told in
the first book of Virgil’s Æneid, about the founding of Carthage by
Dido, who bought from the Libyan king as much ground as she could cover
with a bull’s hide. Elsewhere it is related that she cut the bull’s hide
into narrow strips and encircled therewith all the ground upon which
Carthage was afterward built. Thus Dido deceived the Libyan king nearly
as effectually as Gefjun deluded King Gylfe. The story is also told by
Snorre in Heimskringla, see p. 231.

The passage in verse, which has given translators so much trouble in a
transposed form, would read as follows: Gefjun glad drew that excellent
land (djúpródul = the deep sun = gold; öðla = udal = property; djúpródul
öðla = the golden property), Denmark’s increase (Seeland), so that it
reeked (steamed) from the running oxen. The oxen bore four heads and
eight eyes, as they went before the wide piece of robbed land of the
isle so rich in grass.

Gefjun is usually interpreted as a goddess of agriculture, and her name
is by some derived from γῆ; and _fjon_, that is, _terræ separatio_;
others compare it with the Anglo-Saxon _geofon_ = the sea. The etymology
remains very uncertain.
