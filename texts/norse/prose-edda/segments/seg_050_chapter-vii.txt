CHAPTER VII.

Our ancestors divided the universe into nine worlds, and these again
into three groups:

1. Over the earth. Muspelheim, Ljosalfaheim and Asaheim.

2. On the earth. Jotunheim, Midgard and Vanheim.

3. Below the earth. Svartalfaheim, Niflheim and Niflhel.

The gods had twelve abodes:

1. THRUDHEIM. The abode of Thor. His realm is Thrudvang, and his palace
is Bilskirner.

2. YDALER. Uller’s abode.

3. VALASKJALF. Odin’s hall.

4. SOKVABEK. The abode of Saga.

5. GLADSHEIM, where there are twelve seats for the gods, besides the
throne occupied by Alfather.

6. THRYMHEIM. Skade’s abode.

7. BREIDABLIK. Balder’s abode.

8. HIMMINBJORG. Heimdal’s abode.

9. FOLKVANG. Freyja’s abode.

10. GLITNER. Forsete’s abode.

11. NOATUN. Njord’s abode.

12. LANDVIDE. Vidar’s abode.

According to the Lay of Grimner, the gods had twelve horses, but the
owner of each horse is not given:

(1) Sleipner (Odin’s), (2) Goldtop (Heimdal’s), (3) Glad, (4) Gyller,
(5) Gler, (6) Skeidbrimer, (7) Silvertop, (8) Siner, (9) Gisl, (10)
Falhofner, (11) Lightfoot, (12) Blodughofdi (Frey’s).

The owners of nine of them are not given, and, moreover, it is stated
that Thor had no horse, but always either went on foot or drove his
goats.

The favorite numbers are three, nine and twelve. Monotheism was
recognized in the unknown god, who is from everlasting to everlasting.
A number of trinities were established, and the nine worlds were
classified into three groups. The week had nine days, and originally
there were probably but nine gods, that is, before the vans were united
with the asas. The number nine occurs where Heimdal is said to have nine
mothers, Menglad is said to have nine maid-servants, Æger had nine
daughters, etc. When the vans were united with the asas, the number rose
to twelve:

(1) Odin, (2) Thor, (3) Tyr, (4) Balder, (5) Hoder, (6) Heimdal, (7)
Hermod, (8) Njord, (9) Frey, (10) Uller, (11) Vidar, (12) Forsete.

If we add to this list Brage, Vale and Loke, we get fifteen; but the
Eddas everywhere declare that there are twelve gods, who were entitled
to divine worship.

The number of the goddesses is usually given as twenty-six.
