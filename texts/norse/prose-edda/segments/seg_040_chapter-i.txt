CHAPTER I.

ÆGER’S JOURNEY TO ASGARD.


1. A man by name Æger, or Hler, who dwelt on the island called Hler’s
Isle, was well skilled in the black art. He made a journey to Asgard.
But the asas knew of his coming and gave him a friendly reception; but
they also made use of many sorts of delusions. In the evening, when the
feast began, Odin had swords brought into the hall, and they were so
bright that it glistened from them so that there was no need of any
other light while they sat drinking. Then went the asas to their feast,
and the twelve asas who were appointed judges seated themselves in their
high-seats. These are their names: Thor, Njord, Frey, Tyr, Heimdal,
Brage, Vidar, Vale, Uller, Honer, Forsete, Loke. The asynjes (goddesses)
also were with them: Frigg, Freyja, Gefjun, Idun, Gerd, Sigyn, Fulla,
Nanna. Æger thought all that he saw looked very grand. The panels of the
walls were all covered with beautiful shields. The mead was very strong,
and they drank deep. Next to Æger sat Brage, and they talked much
together over their drink. Brage spoke to Æger of many things that had
happened to the asas.
