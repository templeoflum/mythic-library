CHAPTER X.

This myth about Frey and Gerd is the subject of one of the most
fascinating poems in the Elder Edda, the Journey of Skirner. It is, as
Auber Forestier, in Echoes from Mistland, says, the germ of the Niblung
story. Frey is Sigurd or Sigfrid, and Gerd is Brynhild. The myth is also
found in another poem of the Elder Edda, the Lay of Fjolsvin, in which
the god himself--there called Svipday (the hastener of the
day)--undertakes the journey to arouse from the winter sleep the cold
giant nature of the maiden Menglad (the sun-radiant daughter), who is
identical with Freyja (the goddess of spring, promise, or of love
between man and woman, and who can easily be compared with Gerd). Before
the bonds which enchain the maiden can in either case be broken, Bele
(the giant of spring storms, corresponding to the dragon Fafner in the
Niblung story,) must be conquered, and Wafurloge (the wall of bickering
flames that surrounded the castle) must be penetrated. The fanes
symbolize the funeral pyre, for whoever enters the nether world must
scorn the fear of death. (Auber Forestier’s Echoes from Mistland;
Introduction, xliii, xliv.) We also find this story repeated again and
again, in numberless variations, in Teutonic folk-lore; for instance,
in The Maiden on the Glass Mountain, where the glass mountain takes the
place of the bickering flame.
