CHAPTER IV.

ASK means an ash-tree, and EMBLA an elm-tree.

While the etymology of the names in the myths are very obscure, the
myths themselves are clear enough. Similar myths abound in Greek
mythology. The story about Bil and Hjuke is our old English rhyme about
Jack and Gill, who went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.
