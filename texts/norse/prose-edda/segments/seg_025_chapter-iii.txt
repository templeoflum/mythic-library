CHAPTER III.

OF THE HIGHEST GOD.


3. Ganglere then made the following question: Who is the highest and
oldest of all the gods? Made answer Har: Alfather he is called in our
tongue, but in Asgard of old he had twelve names. The first is Alfather,
the second is Herran or Herjan, the third Nikar or Hnikar, the fourth
Nikuz or Hnikud, the fifth Fjolner, the sixth Oske, the seventh Ome, the
eighth Biflide or Biflinde, the ninth Svidar, the tenth Svidrer, the
eleventh Vidrer, the twelfth Jalg or Jalk. Ganglere asks again: Where is
this god? What can he do? What mighty works has he accomplished?
Answered Har: He lives from everlasting to everlasting, rules over all
his realm, and governs all things, great and small. Then remarked
Jafnhar: He made heaven and earth, the air and all things in them.
Thride added: What is most important, he made man and gave him a spirit,
which shall live, and never perish, though the body may turn to dust or
burn to ashes. All who live a life of virtue shall dwell with him in
Gimle or Vingolf. The wicked, on the other hand, go to Hel, and from her
to Niflhel, that is, down into the ninth world. Then asked Ganglere:
What was he doing before heaven and earth were made? Har gave answer:
Then was he with the frost-giants.
