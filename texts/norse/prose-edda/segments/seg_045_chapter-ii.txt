CHAPTER II.

It is to the delusion or eye-deceit mentioned in this chapter that
Snorre Sturlasson refers in his Heimskringla, in Chapter VI of Ynglinga
Saga.

Thjodolf of Hvin was a celebrated skald at the court of Harald Fairhair.

Thinking thatchers, etc. Literally transposed, this passage would read:
Reflecting men let shields (literally Svafner’s, that is Odin’s
roof-trees,) glisten on the back. They were smitten with stones. To let
shields glisten on the back, is said of men who throw their shields on
their backs to protect themselves against those who pursue the flying
host.

Har means the High One, Jafnhar the Equally High One, and Thride the
Third One. By these three may be meant the three chief gods of the
North: Odin, Thor and Frey; or they may be simply an expression of the
Eddic trinity. This trinity is represented in a number of ways: by Odin,
Vile and Ve in the creation of the world, and by Odin, Hœner and Loder
in the creation of Ask and Embla, the first human pair. The number three
figures extensively in all mythological systems. In the pre-chaotic
state we have Muspelheim, Niflheim and Ginungagap. Fornjot had three
sons: Hler, Loge and Kare. There are three norns: Urd, Verdande and
Skuld. There are three fountains: Hvergelmer, Urd’s and Mimer’s; etc.
(See Norse Mythology, pp. 183, 195, 196.)

Har being Odin, Har’s Hall will be Valhal. You will not come out from
this hall unless you are wiser. In the lay of Vafthrudner, of the Elder
Edda, we have a similar challenge, where Vafthrudner says to Odin:

  Out will you not come
  From our halls
  Unless I find you to be wiser (than I am).
