Gunnar, Gunther, or Gunter, King of Burgundy, was probably a real
personage of the troubled times with which his name is associated--a
period distinguished as much for heroic characters as for tragic
events. Gunther represents the best type of kinghood of his age; a man
swayed by his affections rather than by ambition, who scrupled at
misdeeds, yet yielded to the mastering passions of love; one whose
instincts were loyalty to friends and country, and who shrank from
cruelties to gain his ends, but who fell a victim to woman's
fascinations. History accordingly praises him more for a lover than
for a sovereign.

PREFACE.

Sæmund, son of Sigfus, the reputed collector of the poems bearing his
name, which is sometimes also called the Elder, and the Poetic, Edda,
was of a highly distinguished family, being descended in a direct line
from King Harald Hildetonn. He was born at Oddi, his paternal dwelling
in the south of Iceland, between the years 1054 and 1057, or about 50
years after the establishment by law of the Christian religion in that
island; hence it is easy to imagine that many heathens, or baptized
favourers of the old mythic songs of heathenism, may have lived in his
days and imparted to him the lays of the times of old, which his
unfettered mind induced him to hand down to posterity.

The youth of Sæmund was passed in travel and study, in Germany and
France, and, according to some accounts, in Italy. His cousin John
Ogmundson, who later became first bishop of Holum, and after his death
was received among the number of saints, when on his way to Rome, fell
in with his youthful kinsman, and took him back with him to Iceland,
in the year 1076. Sæmund afterwards became a priest at Oddi, where he
instructed many young men in useful learning; but the effects of which
were not improbably such as to the common people might appear as
witchcraft or magic: and, indeed, Sæmund's predilection for the sagas
and songs of the old heathen times (even for the magical ones) was so
well known, that among his countrymen there were some who regarded him
as a great sorcerer, though chiefly in what is called white or
innocuous and defensive sorcery, a repute which still clings to his
memory among the common people of Iceland, and will long adhere to it
through the numerous and popular stories regarding him (some of them
highly entertaining) that are orally transmitted from generation to
generation.[1] Sæmund died at the age of 77, leaving behind him a work
on the history of Norway and Iceland, which is now almost entirely
lost.

The first who ascribed to Sæmund the collection of poems known as the
Poetic Edda,[2] was Brynjolf Svensson, bishop of Skalholt. This
prelate, who was a zealous collector of ancient manuscripts, found in
the year 1643, the old vellum codex, which is the most complete of
all the known manuscripts of the Edda; of this he caused a transcript
to be made, which he entitled _Edda Saemundi Multiscii_. The
transcript came into the possession of the royal historiographer
Torfæus; the original, together with other MSS., was presented to the
King of Denmark, Frederick. III., and placed in the royal library at
Copenhagen, where it now is.[3] As many of the Eddaic poems appear to
have been orally transmitted in an imperfect state, the collector has
supplied the deficiencies by prose insertions, whereby the integrity
of the subject is to a certain degree restored.

The collection called Sæmund's Edda consists of two parts, viz., the
Mythological and the Heroic. It is the former of those which is now
offered to the public in an English version. In the year 1797, a
translation of this first part, by A.S. Cottle, was published at
Bristol. This work I have never met with; nor have I seen any English
version of any part of the Edda, with the exception of Gray's spirited
but free translation of the Vegtamskvida.

The Lay of Volund (Volundarkvida) celebrates the story of Volund's
doings and sufferings during his sojourn in the territory of the
Swedish king Nidud. Volund (_Ger_. Wieland, _Fr_. Veland and Galans)
is the Scandinavian and Germanic Vulcan (Hephaistos) and Dædalus. In
England his story, as a skillful smith, is traceable to a very early
period. In the Anglo-Saxon poem of Beowulf we find that hero desiring,
in the event of his falling in conflict with Grendel, that his
corslets may be sent to Hygelac, being, as he says, the work of
Weland; and king Ælfred, in his translation of Boethius de
Consolatione, renders the words _fidelis ossa Fabricii, etc_. by Hwæt
(hwær) Welondes? (Where are now the bones of the famous and wise
goldsmith Weland?), evidently taking the proper name of Fabricius for
an appellative equivalent to faber. In the Exeter Book, too, there is
a poem in substance closely resembling the Eddaic lay. In his novel of
Kenilworth, Walter Scott has been guilty of a woeful perversion of the
old tradition, travestied from the Berkshire legend of Wayland Smith.
As a land-boundary we find Weland's smithy in a Charter of king Eadred
A.D. 955.

On the Lay of Helgi Hiorvard's Son there is nothing to remark beyond
what appears in the poem itself.

The Lays of Helgi Hundingcide form the first of the series of stories
relating to the Volsung race, and the Giukungs, or Niflungs.

The connection of the several personages celebrated in these poems
will appear plain from the following tables:

The Eddaic series of the Volsung and Niflung lays terminates with the
Lay of Hamdir; the one entitled Gunnar's Melody is no doubt a
comparatively late composition; yet being written in the true ancient
spirit of the North is well deserving of a place among the Eddaic
poems. Nor, indeed, is the claim of the Lay of Grotti to rank among
the poems collected by Sæmund, by any means clear, we know it only
from its existence in the Skalda; yet on account of its antiquity, its
intrinsic worth, and its reception in other editions of the Edda, both
in original and translation, the present work would seem, and justly
so, incomplete without it.

The Prose, or Younger Edda, is generally ascribed to the celebrated
Snorre Sturleson, who was born of a distinguished Icelandic family, in
the year 1178, and after leading a turbulent and ambitious life, and
being twice the supreme magistrate of the Republic, was killed A.D.
1241,[4] by three of his sons-in-law and a stepson. When Snorre was
three years old, John Loptson of Oddi, the grandson of Sæmund the
Wise, took him into fosterage. Snorre resided at Oddi until his
twentieth year, and appears to have received an excellent education
from his foster father, who was one of the most learned men of that
period. How far he may have made use of the manuscripts of Sæmund and
Ari, which were preserved at Oddi, it is impossible to say, neither do
we know the precise contents of these manuscripts; but it is highly
probable that the most important parts of the work, now known under
the title of "The Prose Edda," formed a part of them, and that
Snorre--who may be regarded as the Scandinavian Euhemerus--merely
added a few chapters, in order to render the mythology more
conformable to the erroneous notions he appears to have entertained
respecting its signification. Be this as it may, the Prose Edda, in
its present form, dates from the thirteenth century, and consists
of--1. _Formali_ (Fore discourse); or the prologue. 2. _Gylfa-ginning_
(The deluding of Gylfi). 3. _Braga-roedur_ (Conversations of Bragi).
4. _Eptirmali_ (After discourse); or Epilogue. The Prologue and
Epilogue were probably written by Snorre himself, and are nothing more
than an absurd syncretism of Hebrew, Greek, Roman, and Scandinavian
myths and legends, in which Noah, Priam, Odin, Hector, Thor, Æneas,
&c, are jumbled together much in the same manner as in the romances of
the Middle Ages. These dissertations, utterly worthless in themselves,
have obviously nothing in common with the so-called "Prose Edda," the
first part of which, containing fifty-three chapters, forms a complete
synopsis of Scandinavian mythology, derived principally from the
Poetical Edda.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 1: The following, the first among many, may serve as a
specimen.

Sæmund was residing, in the south of Europe, with a famous Master, by
whom he was instructed in every kind of lore; while, on the other
hand, he forgot (apparently through intense study) all that he had
previously learned, even to his own name; so that when the holy man
John Ogmundson came to his abode, he told him that his name was Koll;
but on John insisting that he was no other than Sæmund Sigfusson, born
at Oddi in Iceland, and relating to him many particulars regarding
himself, he at length became conscious of his own identity, and
resolved to flee from the place with his kinsman. For the purpose of
deceiving the master, John continued some time in the place, and often
came to visit him and Sæmund; till at last, one dark night, they
betook themselves to flight. No sooner had the Master missed them than
he sent in pursuit of them; but in vain, and the heavens were too
overcast to admit, according to his custom, of reading their
whereabouts in the stars. So they traveled day and night and all the
following day. But the next night was clear, and the Master at once
read in the stars where they were, and set out after them at full
speed. Then Sæmund, casting his eyes up at the heavens, said, "Now is
my Master in chase of us, and sees where we are." And on John asking
what was to be done, he answered: "Take one of my shoes off, fill it
with water, and set it on my head." John did so, and at the same
moment, the Master, looking up at the heavens, says to his companion:
"Bad news; the stranger John has drowned my pupil; there is water
about his forehead." And thereupon returned home. The pair now again
prosecute their journey night and day; but, in the following night,
the Master again consults the stars, when, to his great amazement, he
sees the star of Sæmund directly above his head, and again sets off
after the fugitives. Observing this, Sæmund says: "The astrologer is
again after us, and again we must look to ourselves; take my shoe off
again, and with your knife stab me in the thigh; fill the shoe with
blood, and place it on the top of my head." John does as directed, and
the Master, again gazing at the stars, says: "There is blood now about
the star of Master Koll, and the stranger has for certain murdered
him," and so returns home. The old man now has once more recourse to
his art; but on seeing Sæmund's star shining brightly above him, he
exclaimed: "My pupil is still living; so much the better. I have
taught him more than enough; for he outdoes me both in astrology and
magic. Let them now proceed in safety; I am unable to hinder their
departure."]

Eddaic poems to be of the 8th century. Sagabibliothek II, p, 131.]

[Footnote 3: Codex Regius, No. 2365, 4to. The handwriting of this MS.
is supposed to be of the beginning of the 14th century.]

[Footnote 4: Snorre, at the death of John Loptson (A.D. 1197), does
not appear to have possessed any property whatever, though he
afterwards became the wealthiest man in Iceland. His rise in the world
was chiefly owing to his marriage with Herdisa, the daughter of a
priest called Bersi the Rich,--a very enviable surname, which no doubt
enabled the Rev. gentleman to brave the decrees of Popes and Councils,
and take to himself a wife--who brought him a very considerable
fortune. If we may judge from Snorre's biography, Christianity appears
to have effected very little change in the character of the
Icelanders. We have the same turbulent and sanguinary scenes, the same
loose conduct of the women, and perfidy, and remorseless cruelty of
the men, as in the Pagan times.]


INTRODUCTION TO THE VOLUSPA.

As introductory to the Voluspa, the following description of a
wandering Vala or prophetess may be thought both desirable and
interesting: "We find them present at the birth of children, when they
seem to represent the Norns. They acquired their knowledge either by
means of _seid_, during the night, while all others in the house were
sleeping, and uttered their oracles in the morning; or they received
sudden inspirations during the singing of certain songs appropriate to
the purpose, without which the sorcery could not perfectly succeed.
These seid-women were common over all the North. When invited by the
master of a family, they appeared in a peculiar costume, sometimes
with a considerable number of followers, e.g. with fifteen young men
and fifteen girls. For their soothsaying they received money, gold
rings, and other precious things. Sometimes it was necessary to compel
them to prophesy. An old description of such a Vala, who went from
guild to guild telling fortunes, will give the best idea of these
women and their proceedings":--

"Thorbiorg, nicknamed the little Vala, during the winter attended the
guilds, at the invitation of those who desired to know their fate, or
the quality of the coming year. Everything was prepared in the most
sumptuous manner for her reception. There was an elevated seat, on
which lay a cushion stuffed with feathers. A man was sent to meet her.
She came in the evening dressed in a blue mantle fastened with thongs
and set with stones down to the lap; round her neck she had a
necklace of glass beads, on her head a hood of black lambskin lined
with white catskin; in her hand a staff, the head of which was mounted
with brass and ornamented with stones; round her body she wore a
girdle of agaric (knoske), from which hung a bag containing her
conjuring apparatus; on her feet were rough calfskin shoes with long
ties and tin buttons, on her hands catskin gloves, white and hairy
within. All bade her welcome with a reverent salutation; the master
himself conducted her by the hand to her seat. She undertook no
prophecy on the first day, but would first pass a night there. In the
evening of the following day she ascended her elevated seat, caused
the women to place themselves round her, and desired them to sing
certain songs, which they did in a strong, clear voice. She then
prophesied of the coming year, and afterwards, all that would advanced
and asked her such questions as they thought proper, to which they
received plain answers."

       *       *       *       *       *

In the following grand and ancient lay, dating most probably from the
time of heathenism, are set forth, as the utterances of a Vala, or
wandering prophetess, as above described, the story of the creation of
the world from chaos, of the origin of the giants, the gods, the
dwarfs, and the human race, together with other events relating to the
mythology of the North, and ending with the destruction of the gods
and the world, and their renewal.


VÖLUSPÂ. THE VALA'S PROPHECY.

1. For silence I pray all sacred children, great and small, sons of
Heimdall,[5] they will that I Valfather's deeds recount, men's ancient
saws, those that I best remember.

2. The Jötuns I remember early born, those who me of old have
reared. I nine worlds remember, nine trees, the great central tree,
beneath the earth.

3. There was in times of old, where Ymir dwelt, nor sand nor sea,
nor gelid waves; earth existed not, nor heaven above, 'twas a chaotic
chasm, and grass nowhere.

4. Before Bur's sons raised up heaven's vault, they who the noble
mid-earth shaped. The sun shone from the south over the structure's
rocks: then was the earth begrown with herbage green.

5. The sun from the south, the moon's companion, her right hand cast
about the heavenly horses. The sun knew not where she[6] a dwelling
had, the moon knew not what power he possessed, the stars knew not
where they had a station.

6. Then went the powers all to their judgment-seats, the all-holy
gods, and thereon held council: to night and to the waning moon gave
names; morn they named, and mid-day, afternoon and eve, whereby to
reckon years.

7. The Æsir met on Ida's plain; they altar-steads and temples high
constructed; their strength they proved, all things tried, furnaces
established, precious things forged, formed tongs, and fabricated
tools;

8. At tables played at home; joyous they were; to them was naught
the want of gold, until there came Thurs-maidens three, all powerful,
from Jötunheim.

9. Then went all the powers to their judgment-seats, the all-holy
gods, and thereon held council, who should of the dwarfs the race
create, from the sea-giant's blood and livid bones.

10. Then was Môtsognir created greatest of all the dwarfs, and Durin
second; there in man's likeness they created many dwarfs from earth,
as Durin said.

11. Nýi and Nidi, Nordri and Sudri, Austri and Vestri, Althiôf,
Dvalin Nâr and Nâin, Niping, Dain, Bivör, Bavör, Bömbur, Nori, An and
Anar, Ai, Miodvitnir,

12. Veig and Gandâlf, Vindâlf, Thrain, Thekk and Thorin, Thrôr,
Vitr, and Litr, Nûr and Nýrâd, Regin and Râdsvid. Now of the dwarfs I
have rightly told.

13. Fili, Kili, Fundin, Nali, Hepti, Vili, Hanar, Svior, Billing,
Bruni, Bild, Bûri, Frâr, Hornbori, Fræg and Lôni, Aurvang, Iari,
Eikinskialdi.

14. Time 'tis of the dwarfs in Dvalin's band, to the sons of men, to
Lofar up to reckon, those who came forth from the world's rock,
earth's foundation, to Iora's plains.

15. There were Draupnir, and Dôlgthrasir, Hâr, Haugspori, Hlævang,
Glôi, Skirvir, Virvir, Skafid, Ai, Alf and Yngvi, Eikinskialdi,

16. Fialar and Frosti, Finn and Ginnar, Heri, Höggstari, Hliôdôlf,
Moin: that above shall, while mortals live, the progeny of Lofar,
accounted be.

17. Until there came three mighty and benevolent Æsir to the world
from their assembly. They found on earth, nearly powerless, Ask and
Embla, void of destiny.

18. Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not, blood nor motive
powers, nor goodly colour. Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hoenir, blood
gave Lodur, and goodly colour.

19. I know an ash standing Yggdrasil hight, a lofty tree, laved with
limpid water: thence come the dews into the dales that fall; ever
stands it green over Urd's fountain.

20. Thence come maidens, much knowing, three from the hall, which
under that tree stands; Urd hight the one, the second Verdandi,--on a
tablet they graved--Skuld the third. Laws they established, life
allotted to the sons of men; destinies pronounced.

21. Alone she[7] sat without, when came that ancient dread Æsir's
prince; and in his eye she gazed.

22. "Of what wouldst thou ask me? Why temptest thou me? Odin! I know
all, where thou thine eye didst sink in the pure well of Mim." Mim
drinks mead each morn from Valfather's pledge.[8] Understand ye yet,
or what?

23. The chief of hosts gave her rings and necklace, useful
discourse, and a divining spirit: wide and far she saw o'er every
world.

24. She the Valkyriur saw from afar coming, ready to ride to the
god's people: Skuld held a shield, Skögul was second, then Gunn, Hild
Göndul, and Geirskögul. Now are enumerated Herian's maidens, the
Valkyriur, ready over the earth to ride.

25. She that war remembers, the first on earth, when Gullveig[9]
they with lances pierced, and in the high one's[10] hall her burnt,
thrice burnt, thrice brought her forth, oft not seldom; yet she still
lives.

26. Heidi they called her, whithersoe'r she came, the
well-foreseeing Vala: wolves she tamed, magic arts she knew, magic
arts practised; ever was she the joy of evil people.

27. Then went the powers all to their judgment-seats, the all-holy
gods, and thereon held council, whether the Æsir should avenge the
crime,[11] or all the gods receive atonement.

28. Broken was the outer wall of the Æsir's burgh. The Vanir,
foreseeing conflict, tramp o'er the plains. Odin cast [his spear], and
mid the people hurled it: that was the first warfare in the world.

29. Then went the powers all to their judgment-seats, the all-holy
gods, and thereon held council: who had all the air with evil mingled?
or to the Jötun race Od's maid had given?

30. There alone was Thor with anger swollen. He seldom sits, when
of the like he hears. Oaths are not held sacred; nor words, nor
swearing, nor binding compacts reciprocally made.

31. She knows that Heimdall's horn is hidden under the heaven-bright
holy tree. A river she sees flow, with foamy fall, from Valfather's
pledge. Understand ye yet, or what?

32. East sat the crone, in Iârnvidir, and there reared up Fenrir's
progeny: of all shall be one especially the moon's devourer, in a
troll's semblance.

33. He is sated with the last breath of dying men; the god's seat he
with red gore defiles: swart is the sunshine then for summers after;
all weather turns to storm. Understand ye yet, or what?

34. There on a height sat, striking a harp, the giantess's watch,
the joyous Egdir; by him crowed, in the bird-wood, the bright red
cock, which Fialar hight.

35. Crowed o'er the Æsir Gullinkambi, which wakens heroes with the
sire of hosts; but another crows beneath the earth, a soot-red cock,
in the halls of Hel.

36. I saw of Baldr, the blood-stained god, Odin's son, the hidden
fate. There stood grown up, high on the plain, slender and passing
fair, the mistletoe.

37. From that shrub was made, as to me it seemed, a deadly, noxious
dart. Hödr shot it forth; but Frigg bewailed, in Fensalir, Valhall's
calamity. Understand ye yet, or what?

38. Bound she saw lying, under Hveralund, a monstrous form, to Loki
like. There sits Sigyn, for her consort's sake, not right glad.
Understand ye yet, or what?

39. Then the Vala knew the fatal bonds were twisting, most rigid,
bonds from entrails made.

40. From the east a river falls, through venom dales, with mire and
clods, Slîd is its name.

41. On the north there stood, on Nida-fells, a hall of gold, for
Sindri's race; and another stood in Okôlnir, the Jötuns beer-hall
which Brîmir hight.

42. She saw a hall standing, far from the sun, in Nâströnd; its
doors are northward turned, venom-drops fall in through its apertures:
entwined is that hall with serpents' backs.

43. She there saw wading the sluggish streams bloodthirsty men and
perjurers, and him who the ear beguiles of another's wife. There
Nidhögg sucks the corpses of the dead; the wolf tears men. Understand
ye yet, or what?

44. Further forward I see, much can I say of Ragnarök and the gods'
conflict.

45. Brothers shall fight, and slay each other; cousins shall kinship
violate. The earth resounds, the giantesses flee; no man will another
spare.

46. Hard is it in the world, great whoredom, an axe age, a sword
age, shields shall be cloven, a wind age, a wolf age, ere the world
sinks.

47. Mim's sons dance, but the central tree takes fire at the
resounding Giallar-horn. Loud blows Heimdall, his horn is raised; Odin
speaks with Mim's head.

48. Trembles Yggdrasil's ash yet standing; groans that aged tree,
and the jötun is loosed. Loud bays Garm before the Gnupa-cave, his
bonds he rends asunder; and the wolf runs.

49. Hrym steers from the east, the waters rise, the mundane snake is
coiled in jötun-rage. The worm beats the water, and the eagle screams:
the pale of beak tears carcases; Naglfar is loosed.

50. That ship fares from the east: come will Muspell's people o'er
the sea, and Loki steers. The monster's kin goes all with the wolf;
with them the brother is of Byleist on their course.

51. Surt from the south comes with flickering flame; shines from his
sword the Val-gods' sun. The stony hills are dashed together, the
giantesses totter; men tread the path of Hel, and heaven is cloven.

52. How is it with the Æsir? How with the Alfar? All Jötunheim
resounds; the Æsir are in council. The dwarfs groan before their stony
doors, the sages of the rocky walls. Understand ye yet, or what?

53. Then arises Hlîn's second grief, when Odin goes with the wolf to
fight, and the bright slayer of Beli with Surt. Then will Frigg's
beloved fall.

54. Then comes the great victor-sire's son, Vidar, to fight with the
deadly beast. He with his hands will make his sword pierce to the
heart of the giant's son: then avenges he his father.

55. Then comes the mighty son of Hlôdyn: (Odin's son goes with the
monster to fight); Midgârd's Veor in his rage will slay the worm. Nine
feet will go Fiörgyn's son, bowed by the serpent, who feared no foe.
All men will their homes forsake.

56. The sun darkens, earth in ocean sinks, fall from heaven the
bright stars, fire's breath assails the all-nourishing tree, towering
fire plays against heaven itself.

57. She sees arise, a second time, earth from ocean, beauteously
green, waterfalls descending; the eagle flying over, which in the fell
captures fish.

58. The Æsir meet on Ida's plain, and of the mighty earth-encircler
speak, and there to memory call their mighty deeds, and the supreme
god's ancient lore.

59. There shall again the wondrous golden tables in the grass be
found, which in days of old had possessed the ruler of the gods, and
Fiölnir's race.

60. Unsown shall the fields bring forth, all evil be amended; Baldr
shall come; Hödr and Baldr, the heavenly gods, Hropt's glorious
dwellings shall inhabit. Understand ye yet, or what?

61. Then can Hoenir choose his lot, and the two brothers' sons
inhabit the spacious Vindheim. Understand ye yet, or what?

62. She a hall standing than the sun brighter, with gold bedecked,
in Gimill: there shall be righteous people dwell, and for evermore
happiness enjoy.

64. Then comes the mighty one to the great judgment, the powerful
from above, who rules o'er all. He shall dooms pronounce, and strifes
allay, holy peace establish, which shall ever be.

65. There comes the dark dragon flying from beneath the glistening
serpent, from Nida-fels. On his wings bears Nidhögg, flying o'er the
plain, a corpse. Now she will descend.

THE LAY OF VAFTHRUDNIR.

Odin visits the Giant (Jötun) Vafthrûdnir, for the purpose of proving
his knowledge. They propose questions relative to the Cosmogony of the
Northern creed, on the conditions that the baffled party forfeit his
head. The Jötun incurs the penalty.

_Odin_.

1. Counsel thou me now, Frigg! as I long to go Vafthrûdnir to visit;
great desire, I say, I have, in ancient lore with that all-wise Jötun
to contend.

_Frigg_.

2. At home to bide Hærfather I would counsel, in the gods'
dwellings; because no Jötun is, I believe, so mighty as is
Vafthrûdnir.

_Odin_.

3. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many proved;
but this I fain would know, how in Vafthrûdnir's halls it is.

_Frigg_.

4. In safety mayest thou go, in safety return; in safety on thy
journeyings be; may thy wit avail thee, when thou, father of men!
shalt hold converse with the Jötun.

5. Then went Odin the lore to prove of that all-wise Jötun. To the
hall he came which Im's father owned. Ygg went forthwith in.

_Odin._

6. Hail to thee, Vafthrûdnir! to thy hall I am now come, thyself to
see; for I fain would know, whether thou art a cunning and all-wise
Jötun.

_Vafthrûdnir._

7. What man is this, that in my habitation by word addresses me? Out
thou goest not from our halls, if thou art not the wiser.

_Odin._

8. Gagnrâd is my name, from my journey I am come thirsty to thy
halls, needing hospitality,--for I long have journeyed--and kind
reception from thee, Jötun!

_Vafthrûdnir._

9. Why then, Gagnrâd! speakest thou from the floor? Take in the hall
a seat; then shall be proved which knows most, the guest or the
ancient talker.

_Gagnrâd._

10. A poor man should, who to a rich man comes, speak usefully or
hold his tongue: over-much talk brings him, I ween, no good, who
visits an austere man.

_Vafthrûdnir._

11. Tell me, Gagnrâd! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy
proficiency, how the horse is called that draws each day forth over
human kind?

_Gagnrâd._

12. Skinfaxi he is named, that the bright day draws forth over human
kind. Of coursers he is best accounted among the Reid-goths. Ever
sheds light that horse's mane.

_Vafthrûdnir._

13. Tell me now, Gagnrâd! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy
proficiency, how that steed is called, which from the east draws night
o'er the beneficent powers?

_Gagnrâd._

14. Hrimfaxi he is called, that each night draws forth over the
beneficent powers. He from his bit lets fall drops every morn, whence
in the dales comes dew.

_Vafthrûdnir._

15. Tell me, Gagnrâd! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy
proficiency, how the stream is called, which earth divides between the
Jötuns and the Gods?

_Gagnrâd._

16. Ifing the stream is called which earth divides between the
Jötuns and the Gods: open shall it run throughout all time. On that
stream no ice shall be.

_Vafthrûdnir._

17. Tell me, Gagnrâd! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy
proficiency, how that plain is called, where in fight shall meet Surt
and the gentle Gods?

_Gagnrâd._

18. Vigrid the plain is called where in fight shall meet Surt and
the gentle Gods; a hundred rasts it is on every side. That plain is to
them decreed.

_Vafthrûdnir._

19. Wise art thou, O guest! Approach the Jötuns bench, and sitting
let us together talk; we will our heads in the hall pledge, guest! for
wise utterance.

_Gagnrâd._

20. Tell me first, if thy wit suffices, and thou, Vafthrûdnir!
knowest, whence first came the earth, and the high heaven, thou,
sagacious Jötun?

_Vafthrûdnir._

21. From Ymir's flesh the earth was formed, and from his bones the
hills, the heaven from the skull of that ice-cold giant, and from his
blood the sea.

_Gagnrâd._

22. Tell me secondly, if thy wit suffices, and thou, Vafthrûdnir!
knowest, whence came the moon, which over mankind passes, and the sun
likewise?

_Vafthrûdnir._

23. Mundilfoeri hight he, who the moon's father is, and eke the
sun's: round heaven journey each day they must, to count years for
men.

_Gagnrâd._

24. Tell me thirdly, since thou art called wise, and if thou,
Vafthrûdnir! knowest, whence came the day, which over people passes,
and night with waning moons?

_Vafthrûdnir._

25. Delling hight he who the day's father is, but night was of Nörvi
born; the new and waning moons the beneficent powers created, to count
years for men.

_Gagnrâd._

26. Tell me fourthly, since they pronounce thee sage, and if thou,
Vafthrûdnir! knowest, whence winter came, and warm summer first among
the wise gods?

_Vafthrûdnir._

27. Vindsval hight he, who winter's father is, and Svâsud summer's;
yearly they both shall ever journey, until the powers perish.

_Gagnrâd._

28. Tell me fifthly, since they pronounce thee sage, and if thou,
Vafthrûdnir! knowest, which of the Æsir earliest, or of Ymir's sons,
in days of old existed?

_Vafthrûdnir._

29. Countless winters, ere earth was formed, was Bergelmir born;
Thrûdgelmir was his sire, his grandsire Aurgelmir.

_Gagnrâd._

30. Tell me sixthly, since thou art called wise, and if thou,
Vafthrûdnir! knowest, whence first came Aurgelmir, among the Jötun's
sons, thou sagacious Jötun?

_Vafthrûdnir._

31. From Elivâgar sprang venom drops, which grew till they became a
Jötun; but sparks flew from the south-world: to the ice the fire gave
life.

_Gagnrâd_.

33. Tell me seventhly, since thou are called wise, and if thou
knowest, Vafthrûdnir! how he children begat, the bold Jötun, as he had
no giantess's company?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

33. Under the armpit grew, 'tis said, of the Hrîmthurs, a girl and
boy together; foot with foot begat, of that wise Jötun, a six-headed
son.

_Gagnrâd_.

34. Tell me eighthly, since thou art called wise, and if thou
knowest, Vafthrûdnir! what thou doest first remember, or earliest
knowest? Thou art an all-wise Jötun.

_Vafthrûdnir_.

35. Countless winters, ere earth was formed, Bergelmir was born.
That I first remember, when that wise Jötun in an ark was laid.

_Gagnrâd_.

36. Tell me ninthly, since thou art called wise, and if thou
knowest, Vafthrûdnir! whence the wind comes, that over ocean passes,
itself invisible to man?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

37. Hraesvelg he is called, who at the end of heaven sits, a Jötun
in an eagle's plumage: from his wings comes, it is said, the wind,
that over all men passes.

_Gagnrâd_.

38. Tell me tenthly, since thou all the origin of the gods knowest,
Vafthrûdnir! whence Niörd came among the Æsir's sons? O'er fanes and
offer-steads he rules by hundreds, yet was not among the Æsir born.

_Vafthrûdnir_.

39. In Vanaheim wise powers him created, and to the gods a hostage
gave. At the world's dissolution, he will return to the wise Vanir.

_Gagnrâd_.

40. Tell me eleventhly, since all the condition of the gods thou
knowest, Vafthrûdnir! what the Einheriar do in Haerfather's halls,
until the powers perish?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

41. All the Einheriar in Odin's halls each day together fight; the
fallen they choose, and from the conflict ride; beer with the Æsir
drink, of Saehrimnir eat their fill, then sit in harmony together.

_Gagnrâd_.

42. Tell me twelfthly, as thou all the condition of the gods
knowest, Vafthrûdnir! of the Jötuns' secrets, and of all the gods',
say what truest is, thou all-knowing Jötun!

_Vafthrûdnir_.

43. Of the secrets of the Jötuns and of all the gods, I can truly
tell; for I have over each world travelled; to nine worlds I came, to
Niflhel beneath: here die men from Hel.

_Gagnrâd_.

44. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many
proved. What mortals will live, when the great "Fimbul"-winter shall
from men have passed?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

45. Lif and Lifthrasir; but they will be concealed in Hoddmimir's
holt. The morning dews they will have for food. From, them shall men
be born.

_Gagnrâd_.

46. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many
proved. Whence will come the sun in that fair heaven, when Fenrir has
this devoured?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

47. A daughter shall Alfrödull bear, ere Fenrir shall have swallowed
her. The maid shall ride, when the powers die, on her mother's course.

_Gagnrâd_.

48. Much have I journeyed, etc. Who are the maidens that o'er the
ocean travel, wise of spirit, journey?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

49. O'er people's dwellings three descend of Mögthrasir's maidens,
the sole Hamingiur who are in the world, although with Jötuns
nurtured.

_Gagnrâd_.

50. Much have I journeyed, etc. Which of the Æsir will rule o'er the
gods' possession, when Surt's fire shall be quenched?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

51. Vidar and Vali will the gods' holy fanes inhabit, when Surt's
fire shall be quenched. Môdi and Magni will Miöllnir possess, and
warfare strive to end.

_Gagnrâd_.

52. Much have I journeyed, etc. What of Odin will the life's end be,
when the powers perish?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

53. The wolf will the father of men devour; him Vidar will avenge:
he his cold jaws will cleave, in conflict with the wolf.

_Gagnrâd_.

54. Much have I journeyed, etc. What said Odin in his son's ear, ere
he on the pile was laid?

_Vafthrûdnir_.

55. That no one knoweth, what thou in days of old saidst in thy
son's ear. With dying mouth my ancient saws I have said, and the gods'
destruction. With Odin I have contended in wise utterances: of men
thou ever art the wisest!


THE LAY OF GRIMNIR.

The subject is wholly mythological.


King Hraudung had two sons, one named Agnar, the other Geirröd. Agnar
was ten, and Geirröd eight winters old. They both rowed out in a boat,
with their hooks and lines, to catch small fish; but the wind drove
them out to sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the
shore, and went up into the country, where they found a cottager, with
whom they stayed through the winter. The cottager's wife brought up
Agnar, and the cottager, Geirröd, and gave him good advice. In the
spring the man got them a ship; but when he and his wife accompanied
them to the strand, the man talked apart with Geirröd. They had a fair
wind, and reached their father's place. Geirröd was at the ship's
prow: he sprang on shore, but pushed the ship out, saying, "Go where
an evil spirit may get thee." The vessel was driven out to sea, but
Geirröd went up to the town, where he was well received; but his
father was dead. Geirröd was then taken for king, and became a famous
man.

Odin and Frigg were sitting in Hlidskiâlf, looking over all the world.
Odin said, "Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is, getting
children with a giantess in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster-son, is a
king residing in his country." Frigg answered, "He is so inhospitable
that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come." Odin
replied that that was the greatest falsehood; and they wagered
thereupon. Frigg sent her waiting-maid Fulla to bid Geirröd be on his
guard, lest the trollmann who was coming should do him harm, and also
say that a token whereby he might be known was, that no dog, however
fierce, would attack him. But that King Geirröd was not hospitable was
mere idle talk. He, nevertheless, caused the man to be secured whom no
dog would assail. He was clad in a blue cloak, and was named Grimnir,
and would say no more concerning himself, although he was questioned.
The king ordered him to be tortured to make him confess, and to be set
between two fires; and there he sat for eight nights. King Geirröd had
a son ten years old, whom he named Agnar, after his brother. Agnar
went to Grimnir and gave him a full horn to drink from, saying that
the king did wrong in causing him to be tortured, though innocent.
Grimnir drank from it. The fire had then so approached him that his
cloak was burnt; whereupon he said:--


1. Fire! thou art hot, and much too great; flame! let us separate.
My garment is singed, although I lift it up, my cloak is scorched
before it.

2. Eight nights have I sat between fires here, and to me no one food
has offered, save only Agnar, the son of Geirröd, who alone shall rule
over the land of Goths.

3. Be thou blessed, Agnar! as blessed as the god of men bids thee to
be. For one draught thou never shalt get better recompense.

4. Holy is the land, which I see lying to Æsir and Alfar near; but
in Thrûdheim Thor shall dwell until the powers perish.

5. Ydalir it is called, where Ullr has himself a dwelling made.
Alfheim the gods to Frey gave in days of yore for a tooth-gift.

6. The third dwelling is, where the kind powers have with silver
decked the hall; Valaskiâlf 'tis called, which for himself acquired
the As in days of old.

7. Sökkvabekk the fourth is named o'er which the gelid waves
resound; Odin and Saga there, joyful each day, from golden beakers
quaff.

8. Gladsheim the fifth is named, there the golden-bright Valhall
stands spacious, there Hropt selects each day those men who die by
weapons.

9. Easily to be known is, by those who to Odin come, the mansion by
its aspect. Its roof with spears is laid, its hall with shields is
decked, with corslets are its benches strewed.

10. Easily to be known is, by those who to Odin come, the mansion by
its aspect. A wolf hangs before the western door, over it an eagle
hovers.

11. Thrymheim the sixth is named, where Thiassi dwelt that
all-powerful Jötun; but Skadi now inhabits, the bright bride of gods,
her father's ancient home.

12. Breidablik is the seventh, where Baldr has built for himself a
hall, in that land, in which I know exists the fewest crimes.

13. Himinbiörg is the eighth, where Heimdall, it is said, rules
o'er the holy fanes: there the gods' watchman, in his tranquil home,
drinks joyful the good mead.

14. Fôlkvang is the ninth, there Freyia directs the sittings in the
hall. She half the fallen chooses each day, but Odin th' other half.

15. Glitnir is the tenth; it is on gold sustained, and eke with
silver decked. There Forseti dwells throughout all time, and every
strife allays.

16. Nôatûn is the eleventh, there Niörd has himself a dwelling made,
prince of men; guiltless of sin, he rules o'er the high-built fane.

17. O'ergrown with branches and high grass is Vidar's spacious
Landvîdi: There will the son descend, from the steed's back, bold to
avenge his father.

18. Andhrimnir makes, in Eldhrimnir, Sæhrimnir to boil, of meats the
best; but few know how many Einheriar it feeds.

19. Geri and Freki the war-wont sates, the triumphant sire of hosts;
but on wine only the famed in arms, Odin, ever lives.

20. Hugin and Munin fly each day over the spacious earth. I fear for
Hugin, that he come not back, yet more anxious am I for Munin.

21. Thund roars; joyful in Thiodvitnir's water lives the fish; the
rapid river seems too great for the battle-steed to ford.

22. Valgrind is the lattice called, in the plain that stands, holy
before the holy gates: ancient is that lattice, but few only know how
it is closed with lock.

23. Five hundred doors, and forty eke, I think, are in Valhall.
Eight hundred Einheriar will at once from each door go when they issue
with the wolf to fight.

24. Five hundred floors, and forty eke, I think, has Bilskirnir with
its windings. Of all the roofed houses that I know, is my son's the
greatest.

25. Heidrûn the goat is called, that stands o'er Odin's hall, and
bites from Lærâd's branches. He a bowl shall fill with the bright
mead; that drink shall never fail.

26. Eikthyrnir the hart is called, that stands o'er Odin's hall, and
bites from Lærâd's branches; from his horns fall drops into
Hvergelmir, whence all waters rise:--

27. Sid and Vid, Soekin and Eikin, Svöl and Gunnthrô, Fiörm and
Fimbulthul, Rin and Rennandi, Gipul and Göpul, Gömul and Geirvimul:
they round the gods' dwelling wind. Thyn and Vin, Thöll and Höll, Grâd
and Gunnthorin.

28. Vina one is called, a second Vegsvin, a third Thiodnuma; Nyt and
Nön and Hrön, Slid and Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vîd and Vân, Vönd and
Strönd, Gioll and Leipt; these (two) fall near to men, but fall hence
to Hel.

29. Körmt and Ormt, and the Kerlaugs twain: these Thor must wade
each day, when he to council goes at Yggdrasil's ash; for the
As-bridge is all on fire, the holy waters boil.

30. Glad and Gyllir, Gler and Skeidbrimir, Sillfrintopp and Sinir,
Gisl and Falhôfnir, Gulltopp and Lettfeti; on these steeds the Æsir
each day ride, when they to council go, at Yggdrasil's ash.

31. Three roots stand on three ways under Yggdrasil's ash: Hel under
one abides, under the second the Hrimthursar, under the third mankind.

32. Ratatösk is the squirrel named, which, has to run in Yggdrasil's
ash; he from above the eagle's words must carry, and beneath to
Nidhögg repeat.

33. Harts there are also four, which from its summits, arch-necked,
gnaw. Dâin and Dvalin, Duneyr and Durathrôr.

34. More serpents lie under Yggdrasil's ash, than any one would
think of witless mortals: Gôin and Môin,--they are Grafvitnir's
sons--Grâbak and Grafvöllud, Ofnir and Svafnir, will, I ween, the
branches of that tree ever lacerate.

35. Yggdrasil's ash hardship suffers greater than men know of; a
hart bites it above, and in its side it rots, Nidhögg beneath tears
it.

36. Hrist and Mist the horn shall bear me Skeggöld and Skögul, Hlökk
and Herfiotur, Hildi and Thrûdi, Göll and Geirölul, Randgríd and
Râdgrîd, and Reginleif, these bear beer to the Einheriar.

37. Arvakr and Alsvid, theirs 'tis up hence fasting the sun to draw:
under their shoulder the gentle powers, the Æsir, have concealed an
iron-coolness.

38. Svalin the shield is called, which stands before the sun, the
refulgent deity; rocks and ocean must, I ween, be burnt, fell it from
its place.

39. Sköll the wolf is named, that the fair-faced goddess to the
ocean chases; another Hati hight, he is Hrôdvitnir's son; he the
bright maid of heaven shall precede.

40. Of Ymir's flesh was earth created, of his blood the sea, of his
bones the hills, of his hair trees and plants, of his skull the
heaven;

41. And of his brows the gentle powers formed Midgard for the sons
of men; but of his brain the heavy clouds are all created.

42. Ullr's and all the gods' favour shall have, whoever first shall
look to the fire; for open will the dwelling be, to the Æsir's sons,
when the kettles are lifted off.[12]

43. Ivaldi's sons went in days of old Skidbladnir to form, of ships
the best, for the bright Frey, Niörd's benign son.

44. Yggdrasil's ash is of all trees most excellent, and of all
ships, Skidbladnir, of the Æsir, Odin, and of horses, Sleipnir,
Bifröst of bridges, and of skallds, Bragi, Hâbrôk of hawks, and of
dogs, Garm, [Brimir of swords.]

45. Now I my face have raised to the gods' triumphant sons, at that
will welcome help awake; from all the Æsir, that shall penetrate, to
Oegir's bench, to Oegir's compotation.[13]

46. I am called Grim, I am called Gangleri, Herian and Hiâlmberi,
Thekk and Thridi, Thund and Ud, Helblindi and Har,

47. Sad and Svipall, and Sanngetall, Herteit and Hnikar Bileyg,
Bâleyg, Bölverk, Fiölnir, Grîm and Grimnir, Glapsvid and Fiölsvid,

48. Sîdhött, Sîdskegg Sigfödr, Hnikud, Alfodr, Valfödr, Atrid and
Farmatyr; by one name I never have been called, since among men I have
gone.

49. Grimnir I am called at Geirröd's, and at Asmund's Jâlk and
Kialar, when a sledge I drew; Thrôr at the public meetings, Vidur in
battles, Oski and Omi, Jafnhâr and Biflindi, Gôndlir and Harbard with
the gods.

50. Svidur and Svidrir I was at Sökkmimir's called, and beguiled
that ancient Jötun, when of Midvitnir's renowned son I was the sole
destroyer.

51. Drunken art thou, Geirröd, thou hast drunk too much, thou art
greatly by mead beguiled. Much didst thou lose, when thou wast of my
help bereft, of all the Einheriar's and Odin's favour.

52. Many things I told thee, but thou hast few remembered: thy
friends mislead thee. My friend's sword lying I see, with blood all
dripping.

53. The fallen by the sword Ygg shall now have; thy life is now run
out: Wroth with thee are the Dîsir: Odin thou now shalt see: draw near
to me if thou canst.

54. Odin I now am named, Ygg I was called before, before that,
Thund, Vakr and Skilfing, Vâfudr and Hrôptatyr, with the gods, Gaut
and Jâlk, Ofnir and Svafnir, all which I believe to be names of me
alone.

King Geirröd was sitting with his sword lying across his knees, half
drawn from the scabbard, but on finding that it was Odin, he rose for
the purpose of removing him from the fires, when the sword slipt from
his hand with the hilt downwards; and the king having stumbled, the
sword pierced him through and killed him. Odin then vanished, and
Agnar was king for a long time after.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 12: What in this strophe is said of Ullr has apparently
reference to a lost myth. It would seem that, through the intervention
of the kettles, the Æsir were unable to see Odin's unpleasant position
between the two fires.]

[Footnote 13: My version of this strophe is not in accordance with
those of other interpreters. Odin raises his countenance to heaven, in
full confidence that when seen help will forthwith be afforded him.
Under the name of Oegir, Gierrod is generally understood: I rather
think the meaning to be, that all the Æsir who [sit at] Oegir's
compotation will forthwith come to his aid.]


THE LAY OF VEGTAM, OR BALDR'S DREAMS.

1. Together were the Æsir all in council, and the Asyniur all in
conference, and they consulted, the mighty gods, why Baldr had
oppressive dreams.

2. [To that god his slumber was most afflicting; his auspicious
dreams seemed departed. They the Jötuns questioned, wise seers of the
future, whether this might not forebode calamity?

3. The responses said that to death destined was Ullr's kinsman, of
all the dearest: that caused grief to Frigg and Svafnir, and to the
other powers--On a course they resolved:

4. That they would send to every being, assurance to solicit, Baldr
not to harm. All species swore oaths to spare him; Frigg received all
their vows and compacts.

5. Valfather fears something defective; he thinks the Hamingiur may
have departed; the Æsir he convenes, their counsel craves: at the
deliberation much is devised.]

6. Uprose Odin lord of men and on Sleipnir he the saddle laid; rode
thence down to Niflhel. A dog he met, from Hel coming.

7. It was blood-stained on its breast, on its slaughter-craving
throat, and nether jaw. It bayed and widely gaped at the sire of magic
song:--long it howled.

8. Forth rode Odin--the ground rattled--till to Hel's lofty house he
came. Then rode Ygg to the eastern gate, where he knew there was a
Vala's grave.

9. To the prophetess, he began a magic song to chant, towards the
north looked, potent runes applied, a spell pronounced, an answer
demanded, until compelled she rose, and with deathlike voice she said:

_Vala_.

10. "What man is this, to me unknown, who has for me increased an
irksome course? I have with snow been decked, by rain beaten, and with
dew moistened: long have I been dead."

_Vegtam_.

11. "Vegtam is my name, I am Valtam's son. Tell thou me of Hel:
from, earth I call on thee. For whom are those benches strewed o'er
with rings, those costly couches o'erlaid with gold?"

_Vala_.

12. "Here stands mead, for Baldr brewed, over the bright potion a
shield is laid; but the Æsir race are in despair. By compulsion I have
spoken. I will now be silent."

_Vegtam_.

13. "Be not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I
will yet know who will Baldr's slayer be, and Odin's son of life
bereave."

_Vala_.

14. "Hödr will hither his glorious brother send, he of Baldr will
the slayer be, and Odin's son of life bereave. By compulsion I have
spoken; I will now be silent."

_Vegtam_.

15. "Be not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I
will yet know who on Hödr vengeance will inflict, or Baldr's slayer
raise on the pile."

_Vala_.

16. "Rind a son shall bear, in the western halls: he shall slay
Odin's son, when one night old. He a hand will not wash, nor his head
comb, ere he to the pile has borne Baldr's adversary. By compulsion I
have spoken; I will now be silent."

_Vegtam_.

17. "Be not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I
will yet know who the maidens are, that weep at will, and heavenward
cast their neck-veils? Tell me but that: till then thou sleepest not."

_Vala_.

18. "Not Vegtam art thou, as I before believed; rather art thou
Odin, lord of men!"

_Odin_.

19. "Thou art no Vala, nor wise woman, rather art thou the mother of
three Thursar."

_Vala_.

20. "Home ride thou, Odin! and exult. Thus shall never more man
again visit me, until Loki free from his bonds escapes, and Ragnarök
all-destroying comes."


THE HIGH ONE'S[14] LAY.

1. All door-ways, before going forward, should be looked to; for
difficult it is to know where foes may sit within a dwelling.

2. Givers, hail! A guest is come in: where shall he sit? In much
haste is he, who on the ways has to try his luck.

3. Fire is needful to him who is come in, and whose knees are
frozen; food and raiment a man requires, wheo'er the fell has
travelled.

4. Water to him is needful who for refection comes, a towel and
hospitable invitation, a good reception; if he can get it, discourse
and answer.

5. Wit is needful to him who travels far: at home all is easy. A
laughing-stock is he who nothing knows, and with the instructed sits.

6. Of his understanding no one should be proud, but rather in
conduct cautious. When the prudent and taciturn come to a dwelling,
harm seldom befalls the cautious; for a firmer friend no man ever gets
than great sagacity.

7. A wary guest,[15] who to refection comes, keeps a cautious
silence, with his ears listens, and with his eyes observes: so
explores every prudent man.

8. He is happy, who for himself obtains fame and kind words: less
sure is that which a man must have in another's breast.

9. He is happy, who in himself possesses fame and wit while living;
for bad counsels have oft been received from another's breast.

10. A better burthen no man bears on the way than much good sense;
that is thought better than riches in a strange place; such is the
recourse of the indigent.

11. A worse provision on the way he cannot carry than too much
beer-bibbing; so good is not, as it is said, beer for the sons of men.

12. A worse provision no man can take from table than too much
beer-bibbing: for the more he drinks the less control he has of his
own mind.

13. Oblivion's heron 'tis called that over potations hovers; he
steals the minds of men. With this bird's pinions I was fettered in
Gunnlods dwelling.

14. Drunk I was, I was over-drunk, at that cunning Fialar's. It's
the best drunkenness, when every one after it regains his reason.

15. Taciturn and prudent, and in war daring, should a king's
children be; joyous and liberal every one should be until his hour of
death.

16. A cowardly man thinks he will ever live, if warfare he avoids;
but old age will give him no peace, though spears may spare him.

17. A fool gapes when to a house he comes, to himself mutters or is
silent; but all at once, if he gets drink, then is the man's mind
displayed.

18. He alone knows who wanders wide, and has much experienced, by
what disposition each man is ruled, who common sense possesses.

19. Let a man hold the cup, yet of the mead drink moderately, speak
sensibly or be silent. As of a fault no man will admonish thee, if
thou goest betimes to sleep.

20. A greedy man, if he be not moderate, eats to his mortal sorrow.
Oftentimes his belly draws laughter on a silly man, who among the
prudent comes.

21. Cattle know when to go home, and then from grazing cease; but a
foolish man never knows his stomach's measure.

22. A miserable man, and ill-conditioned, sneers at every thing: one
thing he knows not, which he ought to know, that he is not free from
faults.

23. A foolish man is all night awake, pondering over everything; he
then grows tired; and when morning comes, all is lament as before.

24. A foolish man thinks all who on him smile to be his friends; he
feels it not, although they speak ill of him, when he sits among the
clever.

25. A foolish man thinks all who speak him fair to be his friends;
but he will find, if into court he comes, that he has few advocates.

26. A foolish man thinks he knows everything if placed in unexpected
difficulty; but he knows not what to answer, if to the test he is put.

27. A foolish man, who among people comes, had best be silent; for
no one knows that he knows nothing, unless he talks too much. He who
previously knew nothing will still know nothing, talk he ever so much.

28. He thinks himself wise, who can ask questions and converse also;
conceal his ignorance no one can, because it circulates among men.

29. He utters too many futile words who is never silent; a garrulous
tongue, if it be not checked, sings often to its own harm.

30. For a gazing-stock no man shall have another, although he come a
stranger to his house. Many a one thinks himself wise, if he is not
questioned, and can sit in a dry habit.

31. Clever thinks himself the guest who jeers a guest, if he takes
to flight. Knows it not certainly he who prates at meat, whether he
babbles among foes.

32. Many men are mutually well-disposed, yet at table will torment
each other. That strife will ever be; guest will guest irritate.

33. Early meals a man should often take, unless to a friend's house
he goes; else he will sit and mope, will seem half-famished, and can
of few things inquire.

34. Long is and indirect the way to a bad friend's, though by the
road he dwell; but to a good friend's the paths lie direct, though he
be far away.

35. A guest should depart, not always stay in one place. The welcome
becomes unwelcome, if he too long continues in another's house.

36. One's own house is best, small though it be; at home is every
one his own master. Though he but two goats possess, and a
straw-thatched cot, even that is better than begging.

37. One's own house is best, small though it be, at home is every
one his own master. Bleeding at heart is he, who has to ask for food
at every meal-tide.

38. Leaving in the field his arms, let no man go a foot's length
forward; for it is hard to know when on the way a man may need his
weapon.

39. I have never found a man so bountiful, or so hospitable that he
refused a present; or of his property so liberal that he scorned a
recompense.

40. Of the property which he has gained no man should suffer need;
for the hated oft is spared what for the dear was destined. Much goes
worse than is expected.

41. With arms and vestments friends should each other gladden, those
which are in themselves most sightly. Givers and requiters are longest
friends, if all [else] goes well.[16]

42. To his friend a man should be a friend, and gifts with gifts
requite. Laughter with laughter men should receive, but leasing with
lying.

43. To his friend a man should be a friend; to him and to his
friend; but of his foe no man shall the friend's friend be.

44. Know, if thou hast a friend whom thou fully trustest, and from
whom thou woulds't good derive, thou shouldst blend thy mind with his,
and gifts exchange, and often go to see him.

45. If thou hast another, whom thou little trustest, yet wouldst
good from him derive, thou shouldst speak him fair, but think
craftily, and leasing pay with lying.

46. But of him yet further, whom thou little trustest, and thou
suspectest his affection; before him thou shouldst laugh, and contrary
to thy thoughts speak: requital should the gift resemble.

47. I was once young, I was journeying alone, and lost my way; rich
I thought myself, when I met another. Man is the joy of man.

48. Liberal and brave men live best, they seldom cherish sorrow; but
a base-minded man dreads everything; the niggardly is uneasy even at
gifts.

49. My garments in a field I gave away to two wooden men: heroes
they seemed to be, when they got cloaks: exposed to insult is a naked
man.

50. A tree withers that on a hill-top stands; protects it neither
bark nor leaves: such is the man whom no one favours: why should he
live long?

51. Hotter than fire love for five days burns between false
friends; but is quenched when the sixth day comes, and-friendship is
all impaired.

52. Something great is not [always] to be given, praise is often for
a trifle bought. With half a loaf and a tilted vessel I got myself a
comrade.

53. Little are the sand-grains, little the wits, little the minds of
[some] men; for all men are not wise alike: men are everywhere by
halves.

54. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise: of
those men the lives are fairest, who know much well.

55. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise; for a
wise man's heart is seldom glad, if he is all-wise who owns it.

56. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise. His
destiny let know no man beforehand; his mind will be freest from'
care.

57. Brand burns from brand until it is burnt out; fire is from fire
quickened. Man to' man becomes known by speech, but a fool by his
bashful silence.

58. He should early rise, who another's property or wife desires to
have. Seldom a sluggish wolf gets prey, or a sleeping man victory.

59. Early should rise he who has few workers, and go his work to see
to; greatly is he retarded who sleeps the morn away. Wealth half
depends on energy.

60. Of dry planks and roof-shingles a man knows the measure; of the
fire-wood that may suffice, both measure and time.

61. Washed and refected let a man ride to the Thing,[17] although
his garments be not too good; of his shoes and breeches let no one be
ashamed, nor of his horse, although he have not a good one.

62. Inquire and impart should every man of sense, who will be
accounted sage. Let one only know, a second may not; if three, all the
world knows.

63. Gasps and gapes, when to the sea he comes, the eagle over old
ocean; so is a man, who among many comes, and has few advocates.

64. His power should every sagacious man use with discretion; for he
will find, when among the bold he comes, that no one alone is
doughtiest.

65. Circumspect and reserved every man should be, and wary in
trusting friends. Of the words that a man says to another he often
pays the penalty.

66. Much too early I came to many places, but too late to others:
the beer was drunk, or not ready: the disliked seldom hits the moment.

67. Here and there I should have been invited, if I a meal had
needed; or two hams had hung, at that true friend's, where of one I
had eaten.

68. Fire is best among the sons of men, and the sight of the sun, if
his health a man can have, with a life free from vice.

69. No man lacks everything, although his health be bad: one in his
sons is happy, one in his kin, one in abundant wealth, one in his good
works.

70. It is better to live, even to live miserably; a living man can
always get a cow. I saw fire consume the rich man's property, and
death stood without his door.

71. The halt can ride on horseback, the one-handed drive cattle; the
deaf fight and be useful: to be blind is better than to be burnt[18]
no one gets good from a corpse.

72. A son is better, even if born late, after his father's
departure. Gravestones seldom stand by the way-side unless raised by a
kinsman to a kinsman.

73. Two are adversaries: the tongue is the bane of the head: under
every cloak I expect a hand. * * *

74. At night is joyful he who is sure of travelling entertainment.
[A ship's yards are short.][19] Variable is an autumn night. Many are
the weather's changes in five days, but more in a month.

75. He [only] knows not who knows nothing, that many a one apes
another. One man is rich, another poor: let him not be thought
blameworthy.

76. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but the fair
fame never dies of him who has earned it.

77. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but I know one
thing that never dies,--judgment on each one dead.

78. Full storehouses I saw at Dives' sons': now bear they the
beggar's staff. Such are riches; as is the twinkling of an eye: of
friends they are most fickle.

79. A foolish man, if he acquires wealth or woman's love, pride
grows within him, but wisdom never: he goes on more and more arrogant.

80. Then 'tis made manifest, if of runes thou questionest him, those
to the high ones known, which the great powers invented, and the
great talker[20] painted, that he had best hold silence.

81. At eve the day is to be praised, a woman after she is burnt, a
sword after it is proved, a maid after she is married, ice after it
has passed away, beer after it is drunk.

82. In the wind one should hew wood, in a breeze row out to sea, in
the dark talk with a lass: many are the eyes of day. In a ship voyages
are to be made, but a shield is for protection, a sword for striking,
but a damsel for a kiss.

83. By the fire one should drink beer, on the ice slide; buy a horse
that is lean, a sword that is rusty; feed a horse at home, but a dog
at the farm.

84. In a maiden's words no one should place faith, nor in what a
woman says; for on a turning wheel have their hearts been formed, and
guile in their breasts been laid;

85. In a creaking bow, a burning flame, a yawning wolf, a chattering
crow, a grunting swine, a rootless tree, a waxing wave, a boiling
kettle,

86. A flying dart, a falling billow, a one night's ice, a coiled
serpent, a woman's bed-talk, or a broken sword, a bear's play, or a
royal child,

87. A sick calf, a self-willed thrall, a flattering prophetess, a
corpse newly slain, [a serene sky, a laughing lord, a barking dog, and
a harlot's grief];

88. An early sown field let no one trust, nor prematurely in a son:
weather rules the field, and wit the son, each of which is doubtful;

89. A brother's murderer, though on the high road met, a half-burnt
house, an over-swift horse, (a horse is useless, if a leg be broken),
no man is so confiding as to trust any of these.

90. Such is the love of women, who falsehood meditate, as if one
drove not rough-shod, on slippery ice, a spirited two-years old and
unbroken horse; or as in a raging storm a helmless ship is beaten; or
as if the halt were set to catch a reindeer in the thawing fell.[21]

91. Openly I now speak, because I both sexes know: unstable are
men's minds towards women; 'tis then we speak most fair when we most
falsely think: that deceives even the cautious.

92. Fair shall speak, and money offer, who would obtain a woman's
love. Praise the form of a fair damsel; he gets who courts her.

93. At love should no one ever wonder in another: a beauteous
countenance oft captivates the wise, which captivates not the foolish.

94. Let no one wonder at another's folly, it is the lot of many.
All-powerful desire makes of the sons of men fools even of the wise.

95. The mind only knows what lies near the heart, that alone is
conscious of our affections. No disease is worse to a sensible man
than not to be content with himself.

96. That I experienced, when in the reeds I sat, awaiting my
delight. Body and soul to me was that discreet maiden: nevertheless I
possess her not.

97. Billing's lass[22] on her couch I found, sun-bright, sleeping. A
prince's joy to me seemed naught, if not with that form to live.

98. "Yet nearer eve must thou, Odin, come, if thou wilt talk the
maiden over; all will be disastrous, unless we alone are privy to such
misdeed."

99. I returned, thinking to love, at her wise desire. I thought I
should obtain her whole heart and love.

100. When next I came the bold warriors were all awake, with lights
burning, and bearing torches: thus was the way to pleasure closed.

101. But at the approach of morn, when again I came, the household
all was sleeping; the good damsel's dog alone I found tied to the bed.

102. Many a fair maiden, when rightly known, towards men is fickle:
that I experienced, when that discreet maiden I strove to seduce:
contumely of every kind that wily girl heaped upon me; nor of that
damsel gained I aught.

103. At home let a man be cheerful, and towards a guest liberal; of
wise conduct he should be, of good memory and ready speech; if much
knowledge he desires, he must often talk on good.

104. Fimbulfambi he is called who' little has to say: such is the
nature of the simple.

105. The old Jotun I sought; now I am come back: little got I there
by silence; in many words I spoke to my advantage in Suttung's halls.

106. Gunnlod gave me, on her golden seat, a draught of the precious
mead; a bad recompense I afterwards made her, for her whole soul, her
fervent love.

107. Rati's mouth I caused to make a space, and to gnaw the rock;
over and under me were the Jotun's ways: thus I my head did peril.

108. Of a well-assumed form I made good use: few things fail the
wise; for Odhrærir is now come up to men's earthly dwellings.

109. 'Tis to me doubtful that I could have come from the Jotun's
courts, had not Gunnlod aided me, that good damsel, over whom I laid
my arm.

110. On the day following came the Hrimthursar, to learn something
of the High One, in the High One's hall: after Bolverk they inquired,
whether he with the gods were come, or Suttung had destroyed him?

111. Odin, I believe, a ring-oath[23] gave. Who in his faith will
trust? Suttung defrauded, of his drink bereft, and Gunnlod made to
weep!

112. Time 'tis to discourse from the preacher's chair. By the well
of Urd I silent sat, I saw and meditated, I listened to men's words.

113. Of runes I heard discourse, and of things divine, nor of
graving them were they silent, nor of sage counsels, at the High One's
hall. In the High One's hall. I thus heard say:

114. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice: thou wilt profit if
thou takest it. Rise not at night, unless to explore, or art compelled
to go out.

115. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice, thou wilt profit if
thou takest it. In an enchantress's embrace thou mayest not sleep, so
that in her arms she clasp thee.

116. She will be the cause that thou carest not for Thing or
prince's words; food thou wilt shun and human joys; sorrowful wilt
thou go to sleep.

117. I counsel thee, etc. Another's wife entice thou never to secret
converse.

118. I counsel thee, etc. By fell or firth if thou have to travel,
provide thee well with food.

119. I counsel thee, etc. A bad man let thou never know thy
misfortunes; for from a bad man thou never wilt obtain a return for
thy good will.

120. I saw mortally wound a man a wicked woman's words; a false
tongue caused his death, and most unrighteously.

121. I counsel thee, etc. If thou knowest thou hast a friend, whom
thou well canst trust, go oft to visit him; for with brushwood
over-grown, and with high grass, is the way that no one treads.

122. I counsel thee, etc. A good man attract to thee in pleasant
converse; and salutary speech learn while thou livest.

123. I counsel thee, etc. With thy friend be thou never first to
quarrel. Care gnaws the heart, if thou to no one canst thy whole mind
disclose.

124. I counsel thee, etc. Words thou never shouldst exchange with a
witless fool;

125. For from an ill-conditioned man thou wilt never get a return
for good; but a good man will bring thee favour by his praise.

126. There is a mingling of affection, where one can tell another
all his mind. Everything is better than being with the deceitful. He
is not another's friend who ever says as he says.

127. I counsel thee, etc. Even in three words quarrel not with a
worse man: often the better yields, when the worse strikes.

128. I counsel thee, etc. Be not a shoemaker, nor a shaftmaker,
unless for thyself it be; for a shoe if ill made, or a shaft if
crooked, will call down evil on thee.

129. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever of injury thou knowest, regard
that injury as thy own; and give to thy foes no peace.

130. I counsel thee, etc. Rejoiced at evil be thou never; but let
good give thee pleasure.

131. I counsel thee, etc. In a battle look not up, (like swine the
sons of men then become) that men may not fascinate thee.

132. If thou wilt induce a good woman to pleasant converse, thou
must promise fair, and hold to it: no one turns from good if it can be
got.

133. I enjoin thee to be wary, but not over wary; at drinking be
thou most wary, and with another's wife; and thirdly, that thieves
delude thee not.

134. With insult or derision treat thou never a guest or wayfarer.
They often little know, who sit within, of what race they are who
come.

135. Vices and virtues the sons of mortals bear in their breasts
mingled; no one is so good that no failing attends him, nor so bad as
to be good for nothing.

136. At a hoary speaker laugh thou never; often is good that which
the aged utter, oft from a shriveled hide discreet words issue; from
those whose skin is pendent and decked with scars, and who go
tottering among the vile.

137. I counsel thee, etc. Rail not at a guest, nor from thy gate
thrust him; treat well the indigent; they will speak well of thee.

138. Strong is the bar that must be raised to admit all. Do thou
give a penny, or they will call down on thee every ill in thy limbs.

139. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever thou beer drinkest, invoke to
thee the power of earth; for earth is good against drink, fire for
distempers, the oak for constipation, a corn-ear for sorcery, a hall
for domestic strife. In bitter hates invoke the moon; the biter for
bite-injuries is good; but runes against calamity; fluid let earth
absorb.

ODIN'S RUNE-SONG.[24]

140. I know that I hung, on a wind-rocked tree, nine whole nights,
with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered, myself to myself; on that
tree, of which no one knows from what root it springs.

141. Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink, downward I peered,
to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them, then fell down thence.

142. Potent songs nine from the famed son I learned of Bolthorn,
Bestla's sire, and a draught obtained of the precious mead, drawn from
Odhrærir.

143. Then I began to bear fruit, and to know many things, to grow
and well thrive: word by word I sought out words, fact by fact I
sought out facts.

144. Runes thou wilt find, and explained characters, very large
characters, very potent characters, which the great speaker depicted,
and the high powers formed, and the powers' prince graved:

145. Odin among the Æsir, but among the Alfar, Dain, and Dvalin for
the dwarfs, Asvid for the Jotuns: some I myself graved.

146. Knowest thou how to grave them? knowest thou how to expound
them? knowest thou how to depict them? knowest thou how to prove them?
knowest thou how to pray? knowest thou how to offer? knowest thou how
to send?[25] knowest thou how to consume?

147. 'Tis better not to pray than too much offer; a gift ever looks
to a return. 'Tis better not to send than too much consume. So Thund
graved before the origin of men, where he ascended, to whence he
afterwards came.

148. Those songs I know which the king's wife knows not nor son of
man. Help the first is called, for that will help thee against strifes
and cares.

149. For the second I know, what the sons of men require, who will
as leeches live. * * * *

150. For the third I know,[26] if I have great need to restrain my
foes, the weapons' edge I deaden: of my adversaries nor arms nor wiles
harm aught.

151. For the fourth I know, if men place bonds on my limbs, I so
sing that I can walk; the fetter starts from my feet, and the manacle
from my hands.

152. For the fifth I know, if I see a shot from a hostile hand, a
shaft flying amid the host, so swift it cannot fly that I cannot
arrest it, if only I get sight of it.

153. For the sixth I know, if one wounds me with a green tree's
roots;[27] also if a man declares hatred to me, harm shall consume
them sooner than me.

154. For the seventh I know, if a lofty house I see blaze o'er its
inmates, so furiously it shall not burn that I cannot save it. That
song I can sing.

155. For the eighth I know, what to all is useful to learn: where
hatred grows among the sons of men--that I can quickly assuage.

156. For the ninth I know, if I stand in need my bark on the water
to save, I can the wind on the waves allay, and the sea lull.

157. For the tenth I know, if I see troll-wives sporting in air, I
can so operate that they will forsake their own forms, and their own
minds.

158. For the eleventh I know, if I have to lead my ancient friends
to battle, under their shields I sing, and with power they go safe to
the fight, safe from the fight; safe on every side they go.

159. For the twelfth I know, if on a tree I see a corpse swinging
from a halter, I can so grave and in runes depict, that the man shall
walk, and with me converse.

160. For the thirteenth I know, if on a young man I sprinkle water,
he shall not fall, though he into battle come: that man shall not sink
before swords.

161. For the fourteenth I know, if in the society of men I have to
enumerate the gods, Æsir and Alfar, I know the distinctions of all.
This few unskilled can do.

162. For the fifteenth I know what the dwarf Thiodreyrir sang before
Delling's doors. Strength he sang to the Æsir, and to the Alfar
prosperity, wisdom to Hroptatyr.

163. For the sixteenth I know, if a modest maiden's favour and
affection I desire to possess, the soul I change of the white-armed
damsel, and wholly turn her mind.

164. For the seventeenth I know, that that young maiden will
reluctantly avoid me. These songs, Loddfafnir! thou wilt long have
lacked; yet it may be good if thou understandest them, profitable if
thou learnest them.

165. For the eighteenth I know that which I never teach to maid or
wife of man, (all is better what one only knows. This is the closing
of the songs) save her alone who clasps me in her arms, or is my
sister.

166. Now are sung the High-one's songs, in the High-one's hall, to
the sons of men all-useful, but useless to the Jotuns' sons. Hail to
him who has sung them! Hail to him who knows them! May he profit who
has learnt them! Hail to those who have listened to them!

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 24: The first eight strophes of this composition require an
explanation which I am incompetent to afford. They have had many
interpreters and as many interpretations. The idea of Odin hanging on
a tree would seem to have been suggested by what we read of the grove
at Upsala, or Sigtuna, in which the victims offered to that deity were
suspended from the trees. In the guise of an unknown wanderer, Odin
may be supposed to have been captured and thus offered to himself. It
no doubt refers to some lost legend.]

[Footnote 25: Probably, send them (the runes) forth on their several
missions.]

[Footnote 26: The miraculous powers here ascribed by Odin to himself
bear, in many instances, a remarkable similarity to those attributed
to him by Snorri.]

[Footnote 27: The ancient inhabitants of the North believed that the
roots of trees were particularly fitted for hurtful trolldom, or
witchcraft, and that wounds caused thereby were mortal. In India a
similar superstition prevails of the hurtfulness of the roots of
trees.]


THE LAY OF HYMIR.

1. Once the celestial gods had been taking fish, and were in
compotation, ere they the truth discovered.[28] Rods[29] they shook,
and blood inspected, when they found at Oegir's a lack of kettles.

2. Sat the rock-dweller glad as a child, much like the son of
Miskorblindi. In his eyes looked Ygg's son steadfastly. "Thou to the
Æsir shalt oft a compotation give."

3. Caused trouble to the Jotun th' unwelcome-worded As: he forthwith
meditated vengeance on the gods. Sif's husband he besought a kettle
him to bring, "in which I beer for all of you may brew."

4. The illustrious gods found that impossible, nor could the exalted
powers it accomplish, till from true-heartedness, Ty to Hlorridi much
friendly counsel gave.

5. "There dwells eastward of Elivagar the all-wise Hymir, at
heaven's end. My sire, fierce of mood, a kettle owns, a capacious
cauldron, a rast in depth."

_Thor_.

6. "Knowest thou whether we can get the liquor-boiler?"

_Ty_.

"Yes, friend! if we stratagem' employ." Rapidly they drove forward
that day from Asgard, till to the giant's home they came.

7. Thor stalled his goats, splendid of horn, then turned him to the
hall that Hymir owned. The son his granddam found to him most
loathful; heads she had nine hundred.

8. But another came all-golden forth, fair-browed, bearing the
beer-cup to her son:

9. "Ye Jotuns' kindred! I will you both, ye daring pair, under the
kettles place. My husband is oftentimes niggard towards guests, to
ill-humour prone."

10. But the monster, the fierce-souled Hymir, late returned home
from the chase. He the hall entered, the icebergs resounded, as the
churl approached; the thicket on his cheeks was frozen.

11. "Hail to thee, Hymir! be of good cheer: now thy son is come to
thy hall, whom we expected from his long journey; him accompanies our
famed adversary, the friend of man, who Veor hight.

12. See where they sit under the hall's gable, as if to shun thee:
the pillar stands before them." In shivers flew the pillar at the
Jotun's glance; the beam was first broken in two.

13. Eight kettles fell, but only one of them, a hard-hammered
cauldron, whole from the column. The two came forth, but the old Jotun
with eyes surveyed his adversary.

14. Augured to him his mind no good, when he saw the giantess's
sorrow on the floor coming. Then were three oxen taken, and the Jotun
bade them forthwith be boiled.

15. Each one they made by the head shorter, and to the fire
afterwards bore them. Sif's consort ate, ere to sleep he went,
completely, he alone, two of Hymir's beeves.

16. Seemed to the hoary friend of Hrungnir Hlorridi's refection full
well large: "We three to-morrow night shall be compelled on what we
catch to live."

17. Veor said he would on the sea row, if the bold Jotun him would
with baits supply: "To the herd betake thee, (if thou in thy courage
trustest, crusher of the rock-dwellers!) for baits to seek.

18. I expect that thou wilt bait from an ox easily obtain." The
guest in haste to the forest went, where stood an all-black ox before
him.

19. The Thursar's bane wrung from an ox the high fastness of his two
horns. "To me thy work seems worse by far, ruler of keels! than if
thou hadst sat quiet."

20. The lord of goats the apes' kinsman besought the horse of plank
farther out to move; but the Jotun declared his slight desire farther
to row.

21. The mighty Hymir drew, he alone, two whales up with his hook;
but at the stern abaft Veor cunningly made him a line.

22. Fixed on the hook the shield of men, the serpent's slayer, the
ox's head. Gaped at the bait the foe of gods, the encircler beneath of
every land.[30]

23. Drew up boldly the mighty Thor the worm with venom glistening,
up to the side; with his hammer struck, on his foul head's summit,
like a rock towering, the wolf's own brother.

24. The icebergs resounded, the caverns howled, the old earth shrank
together: at length the fish back into ocean sank.[31]

25. The Jotun was little glad, as they rowed back, so that the
powerful Hymir nothing spake, but the oar moved in another course.

26. "Wilt thou do half the work with me, either the whales home to
the dwelling bear, or the boat fast bind?"

27. Hlorridi went, grasped the prow, quickly, with its hold-water,
lifted the water-steed, together with its oars and scoop; bore to the
dwelling the Jotun's ocean-swine, the curved vessel, through the
wooded hills.

28. But the Jotun yet ever frowned, to strife accustomed, with Thor
disputed, said that no one was strong, however vigorously he might
row, unless he his cup could break.

29. But Hlorridi, when to his hands it came, forthwith brake an
upright stone in twain; sitting dashed the cup through the pillars:
yet they brought it whole to Hymir back.

30. Until the beauteous woman gave important, friendly counsel,
which she only knew: "Strike at the head of Hymir, the Jotun with food
oppressed, that is harder than any cup."

31. Rose then on his knee the stern lord of goats, clad in all his
godlike power. Unhurt remained the old man's helm-block, but the round
wine-bearer was in shivers broken.

32. "Much good, I know, has departed from me, now that my cup I see
hurled from my knees." Thus the old man spake: "I can never say again,
beer thou art too hot.

33. "Now 'tis to be tried if ye can carry the beer-vessel out of our
dwelling." Ty twice assayed to move the vessel, yet at each time stood
the kettle fast.

34. Then Modi's father by the brim grasped it, and trod through the
dwelling's floor. Sif's consort lifted the kettle on his head, while
about his heels its rings jingled.

35. They had far journeyed before Odin's son cast one look backward:
he from the caverns saw, with Hymir from the east, a troop of
many-headed monsters coming.

36. From his shoulders he lifted the kettle down; Miollnir hurled
forth towards the savage crew, and slew all the mountain-giants, who
with Hymir had him pursued.

37. Long they had not journeyed when of Hlorridi's goats one lay
down half-dead before the car. It from the pole had sprung across the
trace; but the false Loki was of this the cause.

38. Now ye have heard,--for what fabulist can more fully tell--what
indemnity he from the giant got: he paid for it with his children
both.[32]

39. In his strength exulting he to the gods' council came, and had
the kettle, which Hymir had possessed, out of which every god shall
beer with Oegir drink at every harvest-tide.

THE LAY OF THRYM, OR THE HAMMER RECOVERED.

1. Wroth was Vingthor, when he awoke, and his hammer missed; his
beard he shook, his forehead struck, the son of earth felt all around
him;

2. And first of all these words he uttered: "Hear now, Loki! what I
now say, which no one knows anywhere on earth, nor in heaven above;
the As's hammer is stolen!"

3. They went to the fair Freyia's dwelling, and he these words first
of all said: "Wilt thou me, Freyia, thy feather-garment lend, that
perchance my hammer I may find?"

_Freyia._

4. "That I would give thee, although of gold it were, and trust it
to thee, though it were of silver."

5. Flew then Loki--the plumage rattled--until he came beyond the
Æsir's dwellings, and came within the Jotun's land.

6. On a mound sat Thrym, the Thursar's lord, for his greyhounds
plaiting gold bands and his horses' manes smoothing.

7. "How goes it with the Æsir? How goes it with the Alfar? Why art
thou come alone to Jotunheim?"

_Loki_.

8. "Ill it goes with the Æsir, Ill it goes with the Alfar. Hast thou
Hlorridi's hammer hidden?"

_Thrym_.

9. "I have Hlorridi's hammer hidden eight rasts beneath the earth;
it shall no man get again, unless he bring me Freyia to wife."

10. Flew then Loki--the plumage rattled--until he came beyond the
Jotun's dwellings, and came within the Æsir's courts; there he met
Thor, in the middle court, who these words first of all uttered.

11. "Hast thou had success as well as labour? Tell me from the air
the long tidings. Oft of him who sits are the tales defective, and he
who lies down utters falsehood."

_Loki_.

12. "I have had labour and success: Thrym has thy hammer, the
Thursar's lord. It shall no man get again, unless he bring him Freyia
to wife."

13. They went the fair Freyia to find; and he those words first of
all said: "Bind thee, Freyia, in bridal raiment, we two must drive to
Jotunheim."

14. Wroth then was Freyia, and with anger chafed, all the Æsir's
hall beneath her trembled: in shivers flew the famed Brisinga
necklace. "Know me to be of women lewdest, if with thee I drive to
Jotunheim."

15. Straightway went the Æsir all to council, and the Asyniur all to
hold converse; and deliberated the mighty gods, how they Hlorridi's
hammer might get back.

16. Then said Heimdall, of Æsir brightest--he well foresaw, like
other Vanir--"Let us clothe Thor with bridal raiment, let him have the
famed Brisinga necklace.

17. "Let by his side keys jingle, and woman's weeds fall round his
knees, but on his breast place precious stones, and a neat coif set on
his head."

18. Then said Thor, the mighty As: "Me the Æsir will call womanish,
if I let myself be clad in bridal raiment."

19. Then spake Loki, Laufey's son: "Do thou, Thor! refrain from
suchlike words: forthwith the Jotuns will Asgard inhabit, unless thy
hammer thou gettest back."

20. Then they clad Thor in bridal raiment, and with the noble
Brisinga necklace, let by his side keys jingle, and woman's weeds fall
round his knees; and on his breast placed precious stones, and a neat
coif set on his head.

21. Then said Loki, Laufey's son: "I will with thee as a servant go:
we two will drive to Jotunheim."

22. Straightway were the goats homeward driven, hurried to the
traces; they had fast to run. The rocks were shivered, the earth was
in a blaze; Odin's son drove to Jotunheim.

23. Then said Thrym, the Thursar's lord: "Rise up, Jotuns! and the
benches deck, now they bring me Freyia to wife, Niord's daughter, from
Noatun.

24. "Hither to our court let bring gold-horned cows, all-black oxen,
for the Jotuns' joy. Treasures I have many, necklaces many, Freyia
alone seemed to me wanting."

25. In the evening they early came, and for the Jotuns beer was
brought forth. Thor alone an ox devoured, salmons eight, and all the
sweetmeats women should have. Sif's consort drank three salds of mead.

26. Then said Thrym, the Thursar's prince: "Where hast thou seen
brides eat more voraciously? I never saw brides feed more amply, nor a
maiden drink more mead."

27. Sat the all-crafty serving-maid close by, who words fitting
found against the Jotun's speech: "Freyia has nothing eaten for eight
nights, so eager was she for Jotunheim."

28. Under her veil he stooped desirous to salute her, but sprang
back along the hall. "Why are so piercing Freyia's looks? Methinks
that fire burns from her eyes."

29. Sat the all-crafty serving-maid close by, who words fitting
found against the Jotun's speech: "Freyia for eight nights has not
slept, so eager was she for Jotunheim."

30. In came the Jotun's luckless sister, for a bride-gift she dared
to ask: "Give me from thy hands the ruddy rings, if thou wouldst gain
my love, my love and favour all."

31. Then said Thrym, the Thursar's lord: "Bring the hammer in, the
bride to consecrate; lay Miollnir on the maiden's knee; unite us each
with other by the hand of Vor."

32. Laughed Hlorridi's soul in his breast, when the fierce-hearted
his hammer recognized. He first slew Thrym, the Thursar's lord, and
the Jotun's race all crushed;

33. He slew the Jotun's aged sister, her who a bride-gift had
demanded; she a blow got instead of skillings, a hammer's stroke for
many rings. So got Odin's son his hammer back.


THE LAY OF THE DWARF ALVIS.

_Alvis_.

1. The benches they are decking, now shall the bride[33] with me
bend her way home. That beyond my strength I have hurried will to
every one appear: at home naught shall disturb my quiet.

_Vingthor_.

2. What man is this? Why about the nose art thou so pale? Hast thou
last night with corpses lain? To me thou seemst to bear resemblance to
the Thursar. Thou art not born to carry off a bride.

_Alvis_.

3. Alvis I am named, beneath the earth I dwell, under the rock I own
a place. The lord of chariots I am come to visit. A promise once
confirmed let no one break.[34]

_Vingthor_.

4. I will break it; for o'er the maid I have, as father, greatest
power. I was from home when the promise was given thee. Among the gods
I the sole giver am.

_Alvis_.

5. What man is this, who lays claim to power over that fair, bright
maiden? For far-reaching shafts few will know thee. Who has decked
thee with bracelets?

_Vingthor_.

6. Vingthor I am named, wide I have wandered; I am Sidgrani's son:
with my dissent thou shalt not that young maiden have, nor that union
obtain.

_Alvis_.

7. Thy consent I fain would have, and that union obtain. Rather
would I possess than be without that snow-white maiden.

_Vingthor_.

8. The maiden's love shall not, wise guest! be unto thee denied, if
thou of every world canst tell all I desire to know.

_Alvis_.

9. Vingthor! thou canst try, as thou art desirous the knowledge of
the dwarf to prove. All the nine worlds I have travelled over, and
every being known.

_Vingthor_.

10. Tell me, Alvis!--for all men's concerns I presume thee, dwarf,
to know--how the earth is called, which lies before the sons of men,
in every world.

_Alvis_.

11. Jord among men 'tis called, but with the Æsir fold; the Vanir
call it vega, the Jotuns igroen, the Alfar groandi, the powers supreme
aur.

_Vingthor_.

12. Tell me, Alvis, etc. how the heaven is called, which is
perceptible in every world.

_Alvis_.

13. Himinn 'tis called by men; but hlyrnir with the gods; vindofni
the Vanir call it, uppheimr the Jotuns, the Alfar fagraræfr, the
dwarfs driupansal.

_Vingthor_.

14. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the moon is called, which men see in
every world.

_Alvis_.

15. Mani 'tis called by men, but mylinn with the gods, hverfanda
hvel in Hel[35] they call it, skyndi the Jotuns, but the dwarfs skin;
the Alfar name it artali.

_Vingthor_.

16. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the sun is called, which men's sons
see in every world.

_Alvis_.

17. Sol among men 'tis called, but with the gods sunna, the dwarfs
call it Dvalinn's leika, the Jotuns eyglo, the Alfar fagrahvel, the
Æsir's sons alskir.

_Vingthor_.

18. Tell me, Alvis, etc., how the clouds are called, which with
showers are mingled in every world.

_Alvis_.

19. Sky they are called by men, but skurvan by the gods; the Vanir
call them vindflot, the Jotuns urvan, the Alfar vedrmegin; in Hel they
are called hialm hulids.

_Vingthor_.

20. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the wind is called, which widely
passes over every world.

_Alvis_.

21. Windr 'tis called by men, but vavudr by the gods, the
wide-ruling powers call it gneggiud, the Jotuns oepir, the Alfar
dynfari, in Hel they call it hvidudr.

_Vingthor_.

22. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the calm is called, which has to rest
in every world.

_Alvis_.

23. Logn 'tis called by men, but lægi by the gods, the Vanir call it
vindslot, the Jotuns ofhly, the Alfar dagsevi, the Dwarfs call it dags
vera.

_Vingthor_.

24. Tell me, Alvis! etc., what the sea is called, which men row over
in every world.

_Alvis_.

25. Sær 'tis called by men, but silægia with the gods; the vanir
call it vagr, the Jotuns alheimr, the Alfar lagastafr, the Dwarfs call
it diupan mar.

_Vingthor_.

26. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the fire is called, which burns before
men's sons in every world.

_Alvis_.

27. Eldr 'tis called by men, but by the Æsir funi; the Vanir call it
vagr, the Jotuns frekr, but the Dwarfs forbrennir; in Hel they call it
hrodudr.

_Vingthor_.

28. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the forest is called, which grows for
the sons of men in every world.

_Alvis_.

29. Vidr 'tis called by men, but vallarfax by the gods, Hel's
inmates call it hlidthangr, the Jotuns eldi, the Alfar fagrlimi; the
Vanir call it vondr.

_Vingthor_.

30. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the night is called, that Norvi's
daughter hight, in every world.

_Alvis_.

31. Nott it is called by men, but by the gods niol; the wide-ruling
powers call it grima, the Jotuns olios, the Alfar svefngaman; the
Dwarfs call it draumniorunn.

_Vingthor_.

32. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the seed is called, which the sons of
men sow in every world.

_Alvis_.

33. Bygg it is called by men, but by the gods barr, the Vanir call
it vaxtr, the Jotuns æti, the Alfar lagastafr; in Hel 'tis hnipinn
called.

_Vingthor_.

34. Tell me, Alvis! etc., how the beer is called, which the sons of
men drink in every world.

_Alvis_.

35. Ol it is called by men, but by the Æsir biorr, the Vanir call it
veig, hreina logr the Jotuns, but in Hel 'tis called miodr: Suttung's
sons call it sumbl.

_Vingthor_.

36. In one breast I have never found more ancient lore. By great
wiles thou hast, I tell thee, been deluded. Thou art above ground,
dwarf! at dawn; already in the hall the sun is shining!

THE LAY OF HARBARD.


Thor journeying from the eastern parts came to a strait or sound, on
the other side of which was a ferryman with his boat. Thor cried
out:--

1. Who is the knave of knaves, that by the sound stands yonder?

_Harbard_.

2. Who is the churl of churls, that cries across the water?

_Thor_.

3. Ferry me across the sound, to-morrow I'll regale thee. I have a
basket on my back: there is no better food: at my ease I ate, before I
quitted home, herrings and oats, with which I yet feel sated.

_Harbard_.

4. Thou art in haste to praise thy meal: thou surely hast no
foreknowledge; for sad will be thy home: thy mother, I believe, is
dead.

_Thor_.

5. Thou sayest now what seems to every one most unwelcome to
know--that my mother is dead.

_Harbard_.

6. Thou dost not look like one who owns three country dwellings,
bare-legged thou standest, and like a beggar clothed; thou hast not
even breeches.

_Thor_.

7. Steer hitherward thy boat; I will direct thee where to land. But
who owns this skiff, which by the strand thou holdest?

_Harbard_.

8. Hildolf fief is named who bade me hold it, a man in council wise,
who dwells in Radso sound. Robbers he bade me not to ferry, or
horse-stealers, but good men only, and those whom I well knew. Tell me
then thy name, if thou wilt cross the sound.

_Thor_.

9. I my name will tell, (although I am an outlaw) and all my kin: I
am Odin's son, Meili's brother, and Magni's sire, the gods' mighty
leader: With Thor thou here mayest speak. I will now ask how thou art
called.

_Harbard_.

10. I am Harbard called; seldom I my name conceal.

_Thor_.

11. Why shouldst thou thy name conceal, unless thou crime hast
perpetrated?

_Harbard_.

12. Yet, though I may crime have perpetrated, I will nathless guard
my life against such as thou art; unless I death-doomed am.

_Thor_.

13. It seems to me a foul annoyance to wade across the strait to
thee, and wet my garments: but I will pay thee, mannikin! for thy
sharp speeches, if o'er the sound I come.

_Harbard_.

14. Here will I stand, and here await thee. Thou wilt have found no
stouter one since Hrungnir's death.

_Thor_.

15. Thou now remindest me how I with Hrungnir fought, that
stout-hearted Jotun, whose head was all of stone; yet I made him fall,
and sink before me. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?

_Harbard_.

16. I was with Fiolvari five winters through, in the isle which
Algron hight. There we could fight, and slaughter make, many perils
prove, indulge in love.

_Thor_.

17. How did your women prove towards you?

_Harbard_.

18. Sprightly women we had, had they but been meek; shrewd ones we
had, had they but been kind. Of sand a rope they twisted, and from the
deep valley dug the earth: to them all I alone was superior in
cunning. I rested with the sisters seven, and their love and pleasures
shared. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?

_Thor_.

19. I slew Thiassi, that stout-hearted Jotun: up I cast the eyes of
Allvaldi's son into the heaven serene: they are signs the greatest of
my deeds. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?

_Harbard_.

20. Great seductive arts I used against the riders of the night,[36]
when from their husbands I enticed them. A mighty Jotun I believed
Hlebard to be: a magic wand he gave me, but from his wits I charmed
him.

_Thor_.

21. With evil mind then thou didst good gifts requitè _Harbard_.

22. One tree gets that which, is from another scraped: each one in
such case is for self. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?

_Thor_.

23. In the east I was, and slew the Jotun brides, crafty in evil, as
they to the mountain went. Great would have been the Jotun race, had
they all lived; and not a man left in Midgard. What meanwhile didst
thou, Harbard?

_Harbard_.

24. I was in Valland, and followed warfare; princes I excited, but
never reconciled. Odin has all the jarls that in conflict fall; but
Thor the race of thralls.

_Thor_.

25. Unequally thou wouldst divide the folk among the Æsir, if thou
but hadst the power.

_Harbard_.

36. Thor has strength over-much, but courage none; from cowardice
and fear, thou wast crammed into a glove, and hardly thoughtest thou
wast Thor. Thou durst not then, through thy terror, either sneeze or
cough, lest Fialar it might hear.

_Thor_.

27. Harbard, thou wretch! I would strike thee dead, could I but
stretch my arm across the sound.

_Harbard_.

28. Why wouldst thou stretch thy arm across the sound, when there is
altogether no offence? But what didst thou, Thor?

_Thor_.

39. In the east I was, and a river I defended, when the sons of
Svarang me assailed, and with stones pelted me, though in their
success they little joyed: they were the first to sue for peace. What
meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?

_Harbard_.

30. I was in the east, and with a certain lass held converse; with
that fair I dallied, and long meetings had. I that gold-bright one
delighted; the game amused her.

_Thor_.

31. Then you had kind damsels there?

_Harbard_.

32. Of thy aid I had need, Thor! in retaining that maiden lily-fair.

_Thor_.

33. I would have given it thee, if I had had the opportunity.

_Harbard_.

34. I would have trusted thee, my confidence if thou hadst not
betrayed it.

_Thor_.

35. I am not such a heel-chafer as an old leather shoe in spring.

_Harbard_.

36. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?

_Thor_.

37. The Berserkers' brides I on Læsso cudgeled; they the worst had
perpetrated, the whole people, had seduced.

_Harbard_.

38. Dastardly didst thou act, Thor! when thou didst cudgel women.

_Thor_.

39. She-wolves they were, and scarcely women. They crushed my ship,
which with props I had secured, with iron clubs threatened me, and
drove away Thialfi. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?

_Harbard_.

40. I in the army was, which was hither sent, war-banners to raise,
lances to redden.

_Thor_.

41. Of that thou now wilt speak, as thou wentest forth us hard terms
to offer.

_Harbard_.

42. That shall be indemnified by a hand-ring, such as arbitrators
give, who wish to reconcile us.

_Thor_.

43. Where didst thou learn words than which I never heard more
irritating?

_Harbard_.

44. From men I learned them, from ancient men, whose home is in the
woods.

_Thor_.

45. Thou givest certainly a good name to grave-mounds, when thou
callest them, homes in the woods.

_Harbard_.

46. So speak I of such a subject.

_Thor_.

47. Thy shrewd words will bring thee evil, if I resolve the sound to
ford. Louder than a wolf thou wilt howl, I trow, if of my hammer thou
gettest a touch.

_Harbard_.

48. Sif has a gallant at home; thou wilt anxious be to find him:
thou shalt that arduous work perform; it will beseem thee better.

_Thor_.

49. Thou utterest what comes upmost, so that to me it be most
annoying, thou dastardly varlet! I believe thou art lying.

_Harbard_.

50. I believe I am telling truth. Thou art travelling slowly; thou
wouldst have long since arrived, hadst thou assumed another form.

_Thor_.

51. Harbard! thou wretch! rather is it thou who hast detained me.

_Harbard_.

52. I never thought that a ferryman could the course of Asa-Thor
retard.

_Thor_.

53. One advice I now will give thee: row hither with thy boat; let
us cease from threats; approach the sire of Magni.

_Harbard_.

54. Go farther from the sound, the passage is refused thee.

_Thor_.

55. Show me then the way, if thou wilt not ferry me across the
water.

_Harbard_.

56. That's too little to refuse. 'Tis far to go; 'tis to the stock
an hour, and to the stone another; then keep the left hand way, until
thou reachest Verland; there will Fiorgyn find her son Thor, and
point out to him his kinsmen's ways to Odin's land.

_Thor_.

57. Can I get there to-day?

_Harbard_.

58. With pain and toil thou mayest get there, while the sun is up,
which, I believe, is now nigh.

_Thor_.

59. Our talk shall now be short, as thou answerest with scoffing
only. For refusing to ferry me I will reward thee, if another time we
meet.

_Harbard_.

60. Just go to where all the powers of evil may have thee.

THE JOURNEY OR LAY OF SKIRNIR.

Frey, son of Niord; had one day seated himself in Hlidskialf, and was
looking over all regions, when turning his eyes to Jotunheim, he there
saw a beautiful girl, as she was passing from her father's dwelling to
her bower. Thereupon he became greatly troubled in mind. Frey's
attendant was named Skirnir; him Niord desired to speak with Frey;
when Skadi said:--

1. Rise up now, Skirnir! go and request our son to speak; and
inquire with whom he so sage may be offended.

_Skirnir_.

2. Harsh words I have from your son to fear, if I go to speak with
him, and to inquire with whom he so sage may be offended.

_Skirnir_.

3. Tell me now, Frey, prince of gods! for I desire to know, why
alone thou sittest in the spacious hall the livelong day?

_Frey_.

4. Why shall I tell thee, thou young man, my mind's great trouble?
for the Alfs' illuminator shines every day, yet not for my pleasure.

_Skirnir_.

5. Thy care cannot, I think, be so great, that to me thou canst not
tell it; for in early days we were young together: well might we trust
each other.

_Frey_.

6. In Gymir's courts I saw walking a maid for whom I long. Her arms
gave forth light wherewith shone all air and water.

7. Is more desirable to me that maid than to any youth in early
days; yet will no one, Æsir or Alfar, that we together live.

_Skirnir_.

8. Give me but thy steed, which can bear me through the dusk,
flickering flame, and that sword, which brandishes itself against the
Jotuns' race.

_Frey_.

9. I will give thee my steed, which can bear thee through the dusk,
flickering flame, and that sword, which will itself brandish, if he is
bold who raises it.

_Skirnir Speaks to the Horse_.

10. Dark it is without, 'tis time, I say, for us to go across the
misty fells, over the Thursar's land: we shall both return, or the
all-potent Jotun will seize us both. Skirnir rides to Jotunheim, to
Gymir's mansion, where fierce dogs were chained at the gate of the
enclosure that was round Gymir's hall. He rides on to where a cowherd
was sitting on a mound, and says to him:

11. Tell me, cowherd! as on the mound thou sittest, and watchest all
the ways, how I to the speech may come, of the young maiden, for
Gymir's dogs?

_Cowherd_.

12. Either thou art death-doomed, or thou art a departed one. Speech
wilt thou ever lack with the good maid of Gymir.

_Skirnir_.

13. Better choices than to whine there are for him who is prepared
to die: for one day was my age decreed, and my whole life determined.

_Gerd_.

14. What is that sound of sounds, which I now sounding hear within
our dwelling? The earth is shaken, and with it all the house of Gymir
trembles.

_A serving-maid_.

15. A man is here without, dismounted from his horse's back: he lets
his steed browse on the grass.

_Gerd_.

16. Bid him enter into our hall, and drink of the bright mead;
although I fear it is my brother's slayer who waits without.

17. Who is this of the Alfar's, or of the Æsir's sons, or of the
wise Vanir's? Why art thou come alone, through the hostile fire, our
halls to visit?

_Skirnir_.

18. I am not of the Alfar's, nor of the Æsir's sons, nor of the wise
Vanir's; yet I am come alone, through the hostile fire, your halls to
visit.

19. Apples all-golden I have here eleven: these I will give thee,
Gerd, thy love to gain, that thou mayest say that Frev to thee lives
dearest.

_Gerd_.

20. The apples eleven I never will accept for any mortal's pleasure;
nor will I and Frey, while our lives last, live both together.

_Skirnir_.

21. The ring too I will give thee, which was burnt with the young
son of Odin. Eight of equal weight will from it drop, every ninth
night.

_Gerd_.

22. The ring I will not accept, burnt though it may have been with
the young son of Odin. I have no lack of gold in Gymir's courts; for
my father's wealth I share.

_Skirnir_.

23. Seest thou this sword, young maiden! thin, glittering-bright,
which I have here in hand? I thy head will sever from thy neck, if
thou speakst not favourably to me.

_Gerd_.

24. Suffer compulsion will I never, to please any man; yet this I
foresee, if thou and Gymir meet, ye will eagerly engage in fight.

_Skirnir_.

25. Seest thou this sword, young maiden! thin, glittering-bright,
which I have here in hand? Beneath its edge shall the old Jotun fall:
thy sire is death-doomed.

26. With a taming-wand I smite thee, and I will tame thee, maiden!
to my will. Thou shalt go thither, where the sons of men shall never
more behold thee.

27. On an eagle's mount thou shalt early sit, looking and turned
towards Hel. Food shall to thee more loathsome be than is to any one
the glistening serpent among men.

28. As a prodigy thou shalt be, when thou goest forth; Hrimnir shall
at thee gaze, all beings at thee stare; more wide-known thou shalt
become than the watch among the gods,[37] if thou from thy gratings
gape.

29. Solitude and disgust, bonds and impatience, shall thy tears with
grief augment. Set thee down, and I will tell thee of a whelming flood
of care, and a double grief.

30. Terrors shall bow thee down the livelong day, in the Jotuns'
courts. To the Hrimthursar's halls, thou shalt each day crawl
exhausted, joyless crawl; wail for pastime shalt thou have, and tears
and misery.

31. With a three-headed Thurs thou shalt be ever bound, or be
without a mate. Thy mind shall tear thee from morn to morn: as the
thistle thou shalt be which has thrust itself on the house-top.

32. To the wold I have been, and to the humid grove, a magic wand to
get. A magic wand I got.

33. Wroth with thee is Odin, wroth with thee is the Æsir's prince;
Frey shall loathe thee, even ere thou, wicked maid! shalt have felt
the gods' dire vengeance.

34. Hear ye, Jotuns! hear ye, Hrimthursar! sons of Suttung! also ye,
Æsir's friends! how I forbid, how I prohibit man's joy unto the
damsel, man's converse to the damsel.

35. Hrimgrimnir the Thurs is named, that shall possess thee, in the
grating of the dead beneath; there shall wretched thralls, from the
tree's roots, goats' water give thee. Other drink shalt thou, maiden!
never get, either for thy pleasure, or for my pleasure.

36. Thurs[38] I cut for thee, and three letters mere: ergi, and
oedi, and othola. So will I cut them out, as I have cut them, in, if
there need shall be.

_Gerd_.

37. Hail rather to thee, youth! and accept an icy cup, filled with
old mead; although I thought not that I ever should love one of Vanir
race.

_Skirnir_.

38. All my errand will I know, ere I hence ride home. When wilt thou
converse hold with the powerful son of Niord?

_Gerd_.

39. Barri the grove is named, which we both know, the grove of
tranquil paths. Nine nights hence, there to Niord's son Gerd will
grant delight.

Skimir then rode home. Frey was standing without, and spoke to him,
asking tidings:

40. Tell me, Skirnir! ere thou thy steed unsaddlest, and a foot
hence thou goest, what thou hast accomplished in Jotunheim, for my
pleasure or thine?

_Skirnir_.

41. Barri the grove is named, which we both know, the grove of
tranquil paths. Nine nights hence, there to Niord's son Gerd will
grant delight.

_Frey_.

42. Long is one night, yet longer two will be; how shall I three
endure. Often a month to me less has seemed than half a night of
longing.

THE LAY OF RIG.

In ancient Sagas it is related that one of the Æsir named Heimdall,
being on a journey to a certain sea-shore, came to a village, where he
called himself Rig. In accordance with this Saga is the following:

1. In ancient days, they say, along the green ways went the powerful
and upright sagacious As, the strong and active Rig, his onward course
pursuing.

2. Forward he went on the mid-way, and to a dwelling came. The door
stood ajar, he went in, fire was on the floor. The man and wife sat
there, hoary-haired, by the hearth, Ai and Edda, in old guise clad.

3. Rig would counsel give to them both, and himself seated in the
middle seat, having on either side the domestic pair.

4. Then Edda from the ashes took a loaf, heavy and thick, and with
bran mixed; more besides she laid on the middle of the board; there in
a bowl was broth on the table set, there was a calf boiled, of cates
most excellent.

5. Then rose he up, prepared to sleep: Rig would counsel give to
them both; laid him down in the middle of the bed; the domestic pair
lay one on either side.

6. There he continued three nights together, then departed on the
mid-way. Nine months then passed way.

7. Edda a child brought forth: they with water sprinkled its swarthy
skin, and named it Thræl.

8. It grew up, and well it throve; of its hands the skin was
shriveled, the knuckles knotty, * * * and the fingers thick; a hideous
countenance it had, a curved back, and protruding heels.

9. He then began his strength to prove, bast to bind, make of it
loads; then faggots carried home, the livelong day.

10. Then to the dwelling came a woman walking, scarred were her
foot-soles, her arms sunburnt, her nose compressed, her name was Thy.

11. In the middle seat herself she placed; by her sat the house's
son. They spoke and whispered, prepared a bed, Thræl and Thy, and days
of care.

12. Children they begat, and lived content: Their names, I think,
were Hreimr and Fiosnir, Klur and Kleggi, Kefsir, Fulnir, Drumb,
Digraldi, Drott and Hosvir, Lut and Leggialdi. Fences they erected,
fields manured, tended swine, kept goats, dug turf.

13. The daughters were Drumba and Kumba, Okkvinkalfa, and Arinnefia,
Ysia and Ambatt, Eikintiasna, Totrughypia, and Tronubeina, whence are
sprung the race of thralls.

14. Rig then went on, in a direct course, and came to a house; the
door stood ajar: he went in; fire was on the floor, man and wife sat
there engaged at work.

15. The man was planing wood for a weaver's beam; his beard was
trimmed, a lock was on his forehead, his shirt close; his chest stood
on the floor.

16. His wife sat by, plied her rock, with outstretched arms,
prepared for clothing. A hood was on her head, a loose sark over her
breast, a kerchief round her neck, studs on her shoulders. Afi and
Amma owned the house.

17. Rig would counsel give to them both; rose from the table,
prepared to sleep; laid him down in the middle of the bed, the
domestic pair lay one on either side.

18. There he continued three nights together. Nine months then
passed away. Amma a child brought forth, they with water sprinkled it,
and called it Karl. The mother in linen swathed the ruddy redhead: its
eyes twinkled.

19. It grew up, and well throve; learned to tame oxen, make a
plough, houses build, and barns construct, make carts, and the plough
drive.

20. Then they home conveyed a lass with pendent keys, and goatskin
kirtle; married her to Karl. Snor was her name, under a veil she sat.
The couple dwelt together, rings exchanged, spread couches, and a
household formed.

21. Children they begat, and lived content. Hal and Dreng, these
were named, Held, Thegn, Smith, Breidr-bondi, Bundinskegg, Bui and
Boddi, Brattskegg and Segg.

22. But [the daughters] were thus called, by other names: Snot,
Brud, Svanni, Svarri, Sprakki, Fliod, Sprund, and Vif, Feima, Ristil;
whence are sprung the races of churls.

23. Rig then went thence, in a direct course, and came to a hall:
the entrance looked southward, the door was half closed, a ring was on
the door-post.

24. He went in; the floor was strewed, a couple sat facing each
other, Fadir and Modir, with fingers playing.

25. The husband sat, and twisted string, bent his bow, and
arrow-shafts prepared; but the housewife looked on her arms, smoothed
her veil, and her sleeves fastened;

26. Her head-gear adjusted. A clasp was on her breast; ample her
robe, her sark was blue; brighter was her brow, her breast fairer, her
neck whiter than driven snow.

27. Rig would counsel give to them both, and himself seated on the
middle seat, having on either side the domestic pair.

28. Then took Modir a figured cloth of white linen, and the table
decked. She then took thin cakes of snow-white wheat, and on the table
laid.

29. She set forth salvers full, adorned with silver, on the table
game and pork, and roasted birds. In a can was wine; the cups were
ornamented. They drank and talked; the day was fast departing, Rig
would counsel give to them both.

30. Rig then rose, the bed prepared; there he then remained three
nights together, then departed on the mid-way. Nine months after that
passed away.

31. Modir then brought forth a boy: in silk they wrapped him, with
water sprinkled him, and named him Jarl. Light was his hair, bright
his cheeks, his eyes piercing as a young serpent's.

32. There at home Jarl grew up, learned the shield to shake, to fix
the string, the bow to bend, arrows to shaft, javelins to hurl,
spears to brandish, horses to ride, dogs to let slip, swords to draw,
swimming to practise.

33. Thither from the forest came Rig walking, Rig walking: runes he
taught him, his own name gave him, and his own son declared him, whom
he bade possess his alodial fields, his alodial fields, his ancient
dwellings.

34. Jarl then rode thence, through a murky way, over humid fells,
till to a hall he came. His spear he brandished, his shield he shook,
made his horse curvet, and his falchion drew, strife began to raise,
the field to redden, carnage to make; and conquer lands.

35. Then he ruled alone over eight vills, riches distributed, gave
to all treasures and precious things; lank-sided horses, rings he
dispersed, and collars cut in pieces.[39]

36. The nobles drove through humid ways, came to a hall, where
Hersir dwelt; there they found a slender maiden, fair and elegant,
Erna her name.

37. They demanded her, and conveyed her home, to Jarl espoused her;
she under the linen[40] went. They together lived, and well throve,
had offspring, and old age enjoyed.

38. Bur was their eldest, Barn the second, Jod and Adal, Arfi, Mog,
Nid and Nidjung. They learned games; Son and Svein swam and at tables
played. One was named Kund, Kon was youngest.

39. There grew up Jarl's progeny; horses they broke, curved shields,
cut arrows, brandished spears.

40. But the young Kon understood runes, æfin-runes, and aldr-runes;
he moreover knew men to preserve, edges to deaden, the sea to calm.

41. He knew the voice of birds, how fires to mitigate, assuage and
quench; sorrows to allay. He of eight men had the strength and energy.

42. He with Rig Jarl in runes contended, artifices practised, and
superior proved; then acquired Rig to be called, and skilled in runes.

43. The young Kon rode through swamps and forests, hurled forth
darts, and tamed birds.

44. Then sang the crow, sitting lonely on a bough! "Why wilt thou,
young Kon: tame the birds? rather shouldst thou, young Kon! on horses
ride * * * and armies overcome.

45. Nor Dan nor Danp halls more costly had, nobler paternal seats,
than ye had. They well knew how the keel to ride, the edge to prove,
wounds to inflict.

The rest is wanting.

OEGIR'S COMPOTATION, OR LOKI'S ALTERCATION.

Oegir, who is also named Gymir, had brewed beer for the Æsir, after he
had got the great kettle, as has been already related. To the
entertainment came Odin and his wife Frigg. Thor did not come, being
in the East, but his wife Sif was there, also Bragi and his wife Idun,
and Ty, who was one-handed, Fenrisulf having bitten off his hand while
being bound. Besides these there were Niord and his wife Skadi, Frey
and Freyia, and Odin's son Vidar. Loki too was there, and Frey's
attendants, Byggvir and Beyla. Many other Æsir and Alfar were also
present.

Oegir had two servants, Fimafeng and Eldir. Bright gold was there used
instead of fire-light. The beer served itself to the guests. The place
was a great sanctuary. The guests greatly praised the excellence of
Oegir's servants. This Loki could not hear with patience, and so slew
Fimafeng; whereupon the Æsir shook their shields, exclaimed against
Loki, chased him into the forest, and then returned to drink. Loki
came again, and found Eldir standing without, whom he thus addressed:

1. Tell me, Eldir! ere thou thy foot settest one step forward, on
what converse the sons of the triumphant gods at their potation?

_Eldir_.

2. Of their arms converse, and of their martial fame, the sons of
the triumphant gods. Of the Æsir and the Alfar that are here within
not one has a friendly word for thee.

_Loki_.

3. I will go into Oegir's halls, to see the compotation. Strife and
hate to the Æsir's sons I bear, and will mix their mead with bale.

_Eldir_.

4. Knowest thou not that if thou goest into Oegir's halls to see the
compotation, but contumely and clamour pourest forth on the kindly
powers, they will wipe it all off on thee?

_Loki_.

5. Knowest thou not, Eldir, that if we two with bitter words
contend, I shall be rich in answers, if thou sayest too much?

Loki then went into the hall, but when those present saw who was come
in, they all sat silent.

_Loki_.

6. I Lopt am come thirsty into this hall, from a long journey, to
beseech the Æsir one draught to give me of the bright mead.

7. Why gods! are ye so silent, so reserved, that ye cannot speak? A
seat and place choose for me at your board, or bid me hie me hence.

_Bragi_.

8. A seat and place will the Æsir never choose for thee at their
board; for well the Æsir know for whom they ought to hold a joyous
compotation.

_Loki_.

9. Odin! dost thou remember when we in early days blended our blood
together? When to taste beer thou didst constantly refuse, unless to
both 'twas offered?

_Odin_.

10. Rise up, Vidar! and let the wolf's sire sit at our compotation;
that Loki may not utter words of contumely in Oegir's hall.

Vidar then rising, presented Loki with drink, who before drinking thus
addressed the Æsir:

11. Hail, Æsir! Hail, Asyniur! And ye, all-holy gods! all, save that
one As, who sits within there, Bragi, on yonder bench.

_Bragi_.

12. A horse and falchion I from my stores will give thee, and also
with a ring reward thee, if thou the Æsir wilt not requite with
malice. Provoke not the gods against thee.

_Loki_.

13. Of horse and rings wilt thou ever, Bragi! be in want. Of the
Æsir and the Alfar, that are here present, in conflict thou art the
most backward, and in the play of darts most timid.

_Bragi_.

14. I know that were I without, as I am now within, the hall of
Oegir, I thy head would bear in my hand, and so for lying punish thee.

_Loki_.

15. Valiant on thy seat art thou, Bragi! but so thou shouldst not
be, Bragi, the bench's pride! Go and fight, if thou art angry; a brave
man sits not considering.

_Idun_.

16. I pray thee, Bragi! let avail the bond of children, and of all
adopted sons, and to Loki speak not in reproachful words, in Oegir's
hall.

_Loki_.

17. Be silent, Idun! of all women I declare thee most fond of men,
since thou thy arms, carefully washed, didst twine round thy brother's
murderer.

_Idun_.

18. Loki I address not with opprobrious words, in Oegir's hall.
Bragi I soothe, by beer excited. I desire not that angry ye fight.

_Gefion_.

19. Why will ye, Æsir twain, here within, strive with reproachful
words? Lopt perceives not that he is deluded, and is urged on by fate.

_Loki_.

20. Be silent, Gefion! I will now just mention, how that fair youth
thy mind corrupted, who thee a necklace gave, and around whom thou thy
limbs didst twine?

_Odin_.

21. Thou art raving, Loki! and hast lost thy wits, in calling
Gefion's anger on thee; for all men's destinies, I ween, she knows as
thoroughly as I do.

_Loki_.

22. Be silent, Odin! Thou never couldst allot conflicts between men:
oft hast thou given to those to whom thou oughtest not--victory to
cowards.

_Odin_.

23. Knowest thou that I gave to those I ought not--victory to
cowards? Thou wast eight winters on the earth below, a milch cow and a
woman, and didst there bear children. Now that, methinks, betokens a
base nature.

_Loki_.

24. But, it is said, thou wentest with tottering steps in Samso, and
knocked at houses as a Vala. In likeness of a fortune teller, thou
wentest among people. Now that, methinks, betokens a base nature.

_Frigg_.

25. Your doings ye should never publish among men, what ye, Æsir
twain, did in days of yore. Ever forgotten be men's former deeds!

_Loki_.

26. Be thou silent, Frigg! Thou art Fiorgyn's daughter, and ever
hast been fond of men, since Ve and Vili, it is said, thou, Vidrir's
wife, didst both to thy bosom take.

_Frigg_.

27. Know thou that if I had, in Oegir's halls, a son like Baldr, out
thou shouldst not go from the Æsir's sons: thou should'st have been
fiercely assailed.

_Loki_.

28. But wilt thou, Frigg! that of my wickedness I more recount? I am
the cause that thou seest not Baldr riding to the halls.

_Freyia_.

29. Mad art thou, Loki! in recounting thy foul misdeeds. Frigg, I
believe, knows all that happens, although she says it not.

_Loki_.

30. Be thou silent, Freyia! I know thee full well; thou art not free
from vices: of the Æsir and the Alfar, that are herein, each has been
thy paramour.

_Freyia_.

31. False is thy tongue. Henceforth it will, I think, prate no good
to thee. Wroth with thee are the Æsir, and the Asyniur. Sad shalt thou
home depart.

_Loki_.

32. Be silent, Freyia! Thou art a sorceress, and with much evil
blended; since against thy brother thou the gentle powers excited. And
then, Freyia! what didst thou do?

_Niord_.

33. It is no great wonder, if silk-clad dames get themselves
husbands, lovers; but 'tis a wonder that a wretched As, that has borne
children, should herein enter.

_Loki_.

34. Be silent, Niord! Thou wast sent eastward hence, a hostage from
the gods. Hymir's daughters had thee for an utensil, and flowed into
thy mouth.[41] _Niord_.

35. 'Tis to me a solace, as I a long way hence was sent, a hostage
from the gods, that I had a son, whom no one hates, and accounted is a
chief among the Æsir.

_Loki_.

36. Cease now, Niord! in bounds contain thyself; I will no longer
keep it secret: it was with thy sister thou hadst such a son; hardly
worse than thyself.

_Ty_.

37. Frey is best of all the exalted gods in the Æsir's courts: no
maid he makes to weep, no wife of man, and from bonds looses all.

_Loki_.

38. Be silent, Ty! Thou couldst never settle a strife 'twixt two; of
thy right hand also I must mention make, which Fenrir from thee tore.

_Ty_.

39. I of a hand am wanting, but thou of honest fame; sad is the lack
of either. Nor is the wolf at ease: he in bonds must bide, until the
gods' destruction.

_Loki_.

40. Be silent, Ty; to thy wife it happened to have a son by me. Nor
rag nor penny ever hadst thou, poor wretch! for this injury.

_Frey_.

41. I the wolf see lying at the river's mouth, until the powers are
swept away. So shalt thou be bound, if thou art not silent, thou
framer of evil.

_Loki_.

42. With gold thou boughtest Gymir's daughter, and so gavest away
thy sword: but when Muspell's sons through the dark forest ride, thou,
unhappy, wilt not have wherewith to fight.

_Byggvir_.

43. Know that were I of noble race, like Ingun's Frey, and had so
fair a dwelling, than marrow softer I would bray that ill-boding crow,
and crush him limb by limb.

_Loki_.

44. What little thing is that I see wagging its tail, and snapping
eagerly? At the ears of Frey thou shouldst ever be, and clatter under
mills.

_Byggvir_.

45. Byggvir I am named, and am thought alert, by all gods and men;
therefore am I joyful here, that all the sons of Hropt drink beer
together.

_Loki_.

46. Be silent, Byggvir! Thou couldst never dole out food to men,
when, lying in thy truckle bed, thou wast not to be found, while men
were fighting.

_Heimdall_.

47. Loki, thou art drunk, and hast lost thy wits. Why dost thou not
leave off, Loki? But drunkenness so rules every man, that he knows not
of his garrulity.

_Loki_.

48. Be silent, Heimdall! For thee in early days was that hateful
life decreed: with a wet back thou must ever be, and keep watch as
guardian of the gods.

_Skadi_.

49. Thou art merry, Loki! Not long wilt thou frisk with an unbound
tail; for thee, on a rock's point, with the entrails of thy ice-cold
son, the gods will bind.

_Loki_.

50. Know, if on a rock's point, with the entrails of my ice-cold
son, the gods will bind me, that first and foremost I was at the
slaying, when we assailed Thiassi.

_Skadi_.

51. Know, if first and foremost thou wast at the slaying, when ye
assailed Thiassi, that from my dwellings and fields shall to thee ever
cold counsels come.

_Loki_.

52. Milder wast thou of speech to Laufey's son, when to thy bed thou
didst invite me. Such matters must be mentioned, if we accurately must
recount our vices.

Then came Sif forth, and poured out mead for Loki in an icy cup,
saying:

53. Hail to thee, Loki! and this cool cup receive, full of old mead:
at least me alone, among the blameless Æsir race, leave stainless.

He took the horn, drank, and said:

54. So alone shouldst thou be, hadst thou strict and prudent been
towards thy mate; but one I know, and, I think, know him well, a
favoured rival of Hlorridi, and that is the wily Loki.

_Beyla_.

55. The fells all tremble: I think Hlorridi is from home journeying.
He will bid be quiet him who here insults all gods and men.

_Loki_.

56. Be silent, Beyla! Thou art Byggvir's wife, and with much evil
mingled: never came a greater monster among the Æsir's sons. Thou art
a dirty strumpet.

Thor then came in and said:

57. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Miollnir, shall
stop thy prating. I will thy head from thy neck strike; then will thy
life be ended.

_Loki_.

58. Now the son of earth is hither come. Why dost thou chafe so,
Thor? Thou wilt not dare do so, when with the wolf thou hast to fight,
and he the all-powerful father swallows whole.

_Thor_.

59. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Miollnir, shall
stop thy prating. Up I will hurl thee to the east region, and none
shall see thee after.

_Loki_.

60. Of thy eastern travels thou shouldest never to people speak,
since in a glove-thumb thou, Einheri! wast doubled up, and hardly
thoughtest thou wast Thor.

_Thor_.

61. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Miollnir, shall
stop thy prating: with this right hand I, Hrungnir's bane, will smite
thee, so that thy every bone be broken.

_Loki_.

62. 'Tis my intention a long life to live, though with thy hammer
thou dost threaten me. Skrymir's thongs seemed to thee hard, when at
the food thou couldst not get, when, in full health, of hunger dying.

_Thor_.

63. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Miollnir, shall
stop thy prating. Hrungnir's bane shall cast thee down to Hel, beneath
the gratings of the dead.

_Loki_.

64. I have said before the Æsir, I have said before the Æsir's sons,
that which my mind suggested: but for thee alone will I go out;
because I know that thou wilt fight.

65. Oegir! thou hast brewed beer; but thou never shalt henceforth a
compotation hold. All thy possessions, which are herein, flame shall
play over, and on thy back shall burn thee.

After this Loki, in the likeness of a salmon, cast himself into the
waterfall of Franangr, where the Æsir caught him, and bound him with
the entrails of his son Nari; but his other son, Narfi, was changed
into a wolf. Skadi took a venomous serpent, and fastened it up over
Loki's face. The venom trickled down from it. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat
by, and held a basin under the venom; and when the basin was full,
carried the venom out. Meanwhile the venom dropped on Loki, who shrank
from it so violently that the whole earth trembled. This causes what
are now called earthquakes.

perversion, by the poet, of what we know of Niord's history.]


THE LAY OF FIOLSVITH.

1. From the outward wall he saw one ascending to the seat of the
giant race.

_Fiolsvith_.

Along the humid ways haste thee back hence, here, wretch! is no place
for thee.

2. What monster is it before the fore-court standing, and hovering
round the perilous flame? Whom dost thou seek? Of what art thou in
quest? Or what, friendless being! desirest thou to know?

_Wanderer_.

3. What monster is that, before the fore-court standing, who to the
wayfarer offers not hospitality? Void of honest fame, prattler! hast
thou lived: but hence hie thee home.

_Fiolsvith_.

4. Fiolsvith is my name; wise I am of mind, though of food not
prodigal. Within these courts thou shalt never come: so now, wretch!
take thyself off.

_Wanderer_.

5. From the eye's delight few are disposed to hurry, where there is
something pleasant to be seen. These walls, methinks, shine around
golden halls. Here I could live contented with my lot.

_Fiolsvith_.

6. Tell me, youth; of whom thou art born, or of what race hast
sprung.

_Wanderer_.

7. Vindkald I am called, Varkald was my father named, his sire was
Fiolkald.

8. Tell me, Fiolsvith! that which I will ask thee, and I desire to
know: who here holds sway, and has power over these lands and costly
halls?

_Fiolsvith_.

9. Menglod is her name, her mother her begat with Svaf, Thorin's
son. She here holds sway, and has power over these lands and costly
halls.

_Vindkald_.

10. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what the grate is called, than which
among the gods mortals never saw a greater artifice?

_Fiolsvith_.

11. Thrymgioll it is called, and Solblindi's three sons constructed
it: a fetter fastens, every wayfarer, who lifts it from its opening.

_Vindkald_.

12. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what that structure is called, than
which among the gods mortals never saw a greater artifice?

_Fiolsvith_.

13. Gastropnir it is called, and I constructed it of Leirbrimir's
limbs. I have so supported it, that it will ever stand while the world
lasts.

_Vindkald_.

14. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what those dogs are called, that chase
away the giantesses, and safety to the fields restore?

_Fiolsvith_.

15. Gifr the one is called, the other Geri, if thou that wouldst
know. Eleven watches they will keep, until the powers perish.

_Vindkald_.

16. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether any man can enter while those
fierce assailants sleep?

_Fiolsvith_.

17. Alternate sleep was strictly to them enjoined, since to the
watch they were appointed. One sleeps by night, by day the other, so
that no wight can enter if he comes.

_Vindkald_.

18. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether there is any food that men can
get, such that they can run in while they eat?

_Fiolsvith_.

19. Two repasts lie in Vidofnir's wings, if thou that wouldst know:
that is alone such food as men can give them and run in while they
eat.

_Vindkald_.

20. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what that tree is called that with its
branches spreads itself over every land?

_Fiolsvith_.

21. Mimameidir it is called; but few men know from what roots it
springs: it by that will fall which fewest know. Nor fire nor iron
will harm it.

_Vindkald_.

22. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., to what the virtue is of that famed
tree applied, which nor fire nor iron will harm?

_Fiolsvith_.

23. Its fruit shall on the fire be laid, for labouring women; out
then will pass what would in remain: so is it a creator of mankind.

_Vindkald_.

24. Tell me, Fioisvith! etc., what the cock is called that sits in
that lofty tree, and all-glittering is with gold?

_Fiolsvith_.

25. Vidofnir he is called; in the clear air he stands, in the boughs
of Mima's tree: afflictions only brings, together indissoluble, the
swart bird at his lonely meal.

_Vindkald_.

26. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether there be any weapon, before
which Vidofnir may fall to Hel's abode?

_Fiolsvith_.

27. Hævatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it, down by the
gate of Death. In an iron chest it lies with Sinmoera, and is with
nine strong locks secured.

_Vindkald_.

28. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether he will alive return, who
seeks after, and will take, that rod?

_Fiolsvith_.

29. He will return who seeks after, and will take, the rod, if he
bears that which few possess to the dame of the glassy clay.

_Vindkald_.

30. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether there is any treasure, that
mortals can obtain, at which the pale giantess will rejoice?

_Fiolsvith_.

31. The bright sickle that lies in Vidofnir's wings, thou in a bag
shalt bear, and to Sinmoera give, before she will think fit to lend an
arm for conflict.

_Vindkald_.

32. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what this hall is called, which is
girt round with a curious flickering flame?

_Fiolsvith_.

33. Hyr it is called, and it will long tremble as on a lance's
point. This sumptuous house shall, for ages hence, be but from hearsay
known.

_Vindkald_.

34. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., which of the Æsir's sons has that
constructed, which within the court I saw?

_Fiolsvith_.

35. Uni and Iri, Bari and Ori, Var and Vegdrasil, Dorri and Uri,
Delling and Atvard, Lidskialf, Loki.

_Vindkald_.

36. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., what that mount is called, on which I
see a splendid maiden stand?

_Fiolsvith_.

37. Hyfiaberg 'tis called, and long has it a solace been to the
bowed-down and sorrowful: each woman becomes healthy, although a
year's disease she have, if she can but ascend it.

_Vindkald_.

38. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., how those maids are called, who sit at
Menglod's knees in harmony together?

_Fiolsvith_.

39. Hlif the first is called, the second is Hlifthursa, the third
Thiodvarta, Biort and Blid, Blidr, Frid, Eir and Orboda.

_Vindkald_.

40. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether they protect those who offer
to them, if it should, be needful?

_Fiolsvith_.

41. Every summer in which men offer to them, at the holy place, no
pestilence so great shall come to the sons of men, but they will free
each from peril.

_Vindkald_.

42. Tell me, Fiolsvith! etc., whether there is any man that may in
Menglod's soft arms sleep?

_Fiolsvith_.

43. There is no man who may in Menglod's soft arms sleep, save only
Svipdag; to him the sun-bright maid is for wife betrothed.

_Vindkald_.

44. Set the doors open! Let the gate stand wide; here thou mayest
Svipdag see; but yet go learn if Menglod will accept my love.

_Fiolsvith_.

45. Hear, Menglod! A man is hither come: go and behold the stranger;
the dogs rejoice; the house has itself opened. I think it must be
Svipdag.

_Menglod_.

46. Fierce ravens shall, on the high gallows, tear out thy eyes, if
thou art lying, that hither from afar is come the youth unto my halls.

47. Whence art thou come? Whence hast thou journeyed? How do thy
kindred call thee? Of thy race and name I must have a token, if I was
betrothed to thee.

_Svipdag_.

48. Svipdag I am named, Solbiart was my father named; thence the
winds on the cold ways drove me. Urd's decree may no one gainsay,
however lightly uttered.

_Menglod_.

49. Welcome thou art: my will I have obtained; greeting a kiss shall
follow. A sight unlooked-for gladdens most persons, when one the other
loves.

50. Long have I sat on my loved hill, day and night expecting thee.
Now that is come to pass which I have hoped, that thou, dear youth,
again to my halls art come.

_Svipdag_.

51. Longing I have undergone for thy love; and thou, for my
affection. Now it is certain, that we shall pass our lives together.


THE LAY OF HYNDLA.

Freyia rides with her favourite Ottar to Hyndla, a Vala, for the
purpose of obtaining information respecting Ottar's genealogy, such
information being required by him in a legal dispute with Angantyr.
Having obtained this, Freyia further requests Hyndla to give Ottar a
potion (minnisol) that will enable him to remember all that has been
told him. This she refuses, but is forced to comply by Freyia having
encircled her cave with flames. She gives him the potion, but
accompanied by a malediction, which is by Freyia turned to a blessing.

_Freyia_.

1. Wake, maid of maids! Wake, my friend! Hyndla! Sister! who in the
cavern dwellest. Now there is dark of darks; we will both to Valhall
ride, and to the holy fane.

2. Let us Heriafather pray into our minds to enter, he gives and
grants gold to the deserving. He gave to Hermod a helm and corslet,
and from him Sigmund a sword received.

3. Victory to his sons he gives, but to some riches; eloquence to
the great, and to men, wit; fair wind he gives to traders, but poesy
to skallds; valour he gives to many a warrior.

4. She to Thor will offer, she to him will pray, that to thee he may
be well disposed; although he bears ill will to Jotun females.

5. Now of thy wolves take one from out the stall; let him run with
runic rein.[42] _Hyndla_.

6. Sluggish is thy hog the god's way to tread:

_Freyia_.

7. I will my noble palfrey saddle.

_Hyndla_.

8. False are thou, Freyia! who temptest me: by thy eyes thou showest
it, so fixed upon us; while thou thy man hast on the dead-road,[43]
the young Ottar, Innstein's son.

9. Dull art thou, Hyndla! methinks thou dreamest, since thou sayest
that my man is on the dead-road with me; there where my hog sparkles
with its golden bristles, hight Hildisvini, which for me made the two
skilful dwarfs, Dain and Nabbi. From the saddle we will talk: let us
sit, and of princely families discourse, of those chieftains who from
the gods descend. They have contested for the dead's gold, Ottar the
young and Angantyr.

10. A duty 'tis to act so that the young prince his paternal
heritage may have, after his kindred.

11. An offer-stead to me he raised, with stones constructed; now is
that stone as glass become. With the blood of oxen he newly sprinkled
it. Ottar ever trusted in the Asyniur.

12. Now let us reckon up the ancient families, and the races of
exalted men. Who are the Skioldungs? Who are the Skilfings? Who the
Odlings? Who the Ylfings? Who the hold-born? Who the hers-born? The
choicest race of men under heaven?


_Hyndla_.

13. Thou, Ottar! art of Innstein born, but Innstein was from Alf the
Old, Alf was from Ulf, Ulf from Sæfari, but Sæfari from Svan the Red.

14. Thy father had a mother, for her necklaces famed, she, I think,
was named Hledis the priestess; Frodi her father was, and her mother
Friant: all that stock is reckoned among chieftains.

15. Ali was of old of men the strongest, Halfdan before him, the
highest of the Skioldungs; (Famed were the wars by those chieftains
led) his deeds seemed to soar to the skirts of heaven.

16. By Eimund aided, chief of men, he Sigtrygg slew with the cold
steel. He Almveig had to wife, first of women. They begat and had
eighteen sons.

17. From them the Skioldungs, from them the Skilfings, from them the
Odlings, from them the Ynglings, from them the hold-born, from them
the hers-born, the choicest race of men under heaven. All that race is
thine, Ottar Heimski!

18. Hildegun her mother was, of Svafa born and a sea-king. All that
race is thine, Ottar Heimski! Carest thou this to know? Wishest thou a
longer narrative?

19. Dag wedded Thora, mother of warriors: of that race were born the
noble champions, Fradmar, Gyrd, and the Frekis both, Am, Josur, Mar,
Alf the Old. Carest thou this to know? Wishest thou a longer
narrative?

20. Ketil their friend was named, heir of Klyp; he was maternal
grandsire of thy mother. Then was Frodi yet before Kari, but the
eldest born was Alf.

21. Nanna was next, Nokkvi's daughter; her son was thy father's
kinsman, ancient is that kinship. I knew both Brodd and Horfi. All
that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

22. Isolf, Asolf, Olmod's sons and Skurhild's Skekkil's daughter;
thou shalt yet count chieftains many. All that race is thine, Ottar
Heimski!

23. Gunnar, Balk, Grim, Ardskafi, Jarnskiold, Thorir, Ulf, Ginandi,
Bui and Brami, Barri and Reifnir, Tind and Hyrfing, the two Haddingis.
All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

24. To toil and tumult were the sons of Arngrim born, and of Eyfura:
ferocious berserkir, calamity of every kind, by land and sea, like
fire they carried. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

25. I knew both Brodd and Horfi, they were in the court of Hrolf the
Old; all descended from Jormunrek, son-in-law of Sigurd. (Listen to my
story) the dread of nations, him who Fafnir slew.

26. He was a king, from Volsung sprung, and Hiordis from Hrodung;
but Eylimi from the Odlings. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

27. Gunnar and Hogni, sons of Giuki; and Gudrun likewise, their
sister. Guttorm; was not of Giuki's race, although he brother was of
them both. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

28. Harald Hildetonn, born of Hrærekir Slongvanbaugi; he was a son
of Aud, Aud the rich was Ivar's daughter; but Radbard was Randver's
father. They were heroes to the gods devoted. All that race is thine,
Ottar Heimski!

29. There were eleven Æsir reckoned, when Baldr on the pile was
laid; him Vali showed himself worthy to avenge, his own brother: he
the slayer slew. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!

30. Baldr's father was son of Bur: Frey to wife had Gerd, she was
Gymir's daughter, from Jotuns sprung and Aurboda; Thiassi also was
their relation, that haughty Jotun; Skadi was his daughter.

31. We tell thee much, and remember more: I admonish thee thus much
to know. Wishest thou yet a longer narrative?

32. Haki was not the worst of Hvedna's sons, and Hiorvard was
Hvedna's father; Heid and Hrossthiof were of Hrimnir's race.

33. All the Valas are from Vidolf; all the soothsayers from
Vilmeidr, all the sorcerers from Svarthofdi; all the Jotuns come from
Ymir.

34. We tell thee much, and more remember, I admonish thee thus much
to know. Wishest thou yet a longer narrative?

35. There was one born, in times of old, with wondrous might
endowed, of origin divine: nine Jotun maids gave birth to the gracious
god, at the world's margin.

36. Gialp gave him birth, Greip gave him birth, Eistla gave him
birth, and Angeia; Ulfrun gave him birth, and Eyrgiafa, Imd and Atla,
and Jarnsaxa.

37. The boy was nourished with the strength of earth, with the
ice-cold sea, and with Son's blood. We tell thee much, and more
remember. I admonish thee thus much to know. Wishest thou a yet longer
narrative?

38. Loki begat the wolf with Angrboda, but Sleipnir he begat with
Svadilfari: one monster seemed of all most deadly, which from
Byleist's brother sprang.

39. Loki, scorched up in his heart's affections, had found a
half-burnt woman's heart. Loki became guileful from that wicked woman;
thence in the world are all giantesses come.

40. Ocean towers with storms to heaven itself, flows o'er the land;
the air is rent: thence come snows and rapid winds; then it is decreed
that the rain should cease.

41. There was one born greater than all, the boy was nourished with
the strength of earth; he was declared a ruler, mightiest and richest,
allied by kinship to all princes.

42. Then shall another come, yet mightier, although I dare not his
name declare. Few may see further forth than when Odin meets the wolf.


_Freyia_.

43. Bear thou the memory-cup to my guest, so that he may all the
words repeat of this, discourse, on the third morn, when he and
Angantyr reckon up races.


_Hyndla_.

44. Go thou quickly hence, I long to sleep; more of my wondrous
power thou gettest not from me. Thou runnest, my hot friend, out at
nights, as among he-goats the she-goat goes.

45. Thou hast run thyself mad, ever longing; many a one has stolen
under thy girdle. Thou runnest, my hot friend, out at nights, as among
he-goats, the she-goat goes.


_Freyia_.

46. Fire I strike over thee, dweller of the wood! so that thou goest
not ever away from hence.


_Hyndla_.

47. Fire I see burning, and the earth blazing; many will have their
lives to save. Bear thou the cup to Ottar's hand, the mead with venom
mingled, in an evil hour!

_Freyia_.

48. Thy malediction shall be powerless; although thou, Jotun-maid!
dost evil threaten. He shall drink delicious draughts. All the gods I
pray to favour Ottar.

THE INCANTATION OF GROA.

_Son_.

1. Wake up, Groa! wake up, good woman! at the gates of death I wake
thee! if thou rememberest, that thou thy son badest to thy grave-mound
to come.

_Mother_.

2. What now troubles my only son? With what affliction art thou
burthened, that thou thy mother callest, who to dust is come, and from
human homes departed?

_Son_.

3. A hateful game thou, crafty woman, didst set before me, whom my
has father in his bosom cherished, when thou badest me go no one knows
whither, Menglod to meet.

_Mother_.

4. Long is the journey, long are the ways, long are men's desires.
If it so fall out, that thou thy will obtainest, the event must then
be as it may.

_Son_.

5. Sing to me songs which are good. Mother! protect thy son. Dead on
my way I fear to be. I seem too young in years.

_Mother_.

6. I will sing to thee first one that is thought most useful, which
Rind sang to Ran; that from thy shoulders thou shouldst cast what to
thee seems irksome: let thyself thyself direct.

7. A second I will sing to thee, as thou hast to wander joyless on
thy ways. May Urd's protection hold thee on every side, where thou
seest turpitude.

8. A third I will sing to thee. If the mighty rivers to thy life's
peril fall, Horn and Rud, may they flow down to Hel, and for thee ever
be diminished.

9. A fourth I will sing to thee. If foes assail thee ready on the
dangerous road, their hearts shall fail them, and to thee be power,
and their minds to peace be turned.

10. A fifth I will sing to thee. If bonds be cast on thy limbs,
friendly spells I will let on thy joints be sung, and the lock from
thy arms shall start, [and from thy feet the fetter].

11. A sixth I will sing to thee. If on the sea thou comest, more
stormy than men have known it, air and water shall in a bag attend
thee, and a tranquil course afford thee.

12. A seventh I will sing to thee. If on a mountain high frost
should assail thee, deadly cold shall not thy carcase injure, nor draw
thy body to thy limbs.

13. An eighth I will sing to thee. If night overtake thee, when out
on the misty way, that the dead Christian woman no power may have to
do thee harm.

14. A ninth I will sing to thee. If with a far-famed spear-armed
Jotun thou words exchangest, of words and wit to thy mindful heart
abundance shall be given.

15. Go now ever where calamity may be, and no harm shall obstruct
thy wishes. On a stone fast in the earth I have stood within the door,
while songs I sang to thee.

16. My son! bear hence thy mother's words, and in thy breast let
them dwell; for happiness abundant shalt thou have in life, while of
my words thou art mindful.


THE SONG OF THE SUN.

This singular poem, the authorship of which is, in some manuscripts,
assigned to Sæmund himself, may be termed a Voice from the Dead, given
under the form of a dream, in which a deceased father is supposed to
address his son from another world. The first 7 strophes seem hardly
connected with the following ones, which, as far as the 32nd consist
chiefly in aphorisms with examples, some closely resembling those in
the Havamal. In the remaining portion is given the recital of the last
illness of the supposed speaker, his death, and the scenes his soul
passed through on the way to its final home.

The composition exhibits a strange mixture of Christianity and
Heathenism, whence it would seem that the poet's own religion was in a
transition state. Of the allusions to Heathenism it is, however, to be
observed that they are chiefly to persons and actions of which there
is no trace in the Odinic mythology, as known to us, and are possibly
the fruits of the poet's own imagination. The title of the poem is no
doubt derived from the allusion to the Sun at the beginning of
strophes 39-45.

For an elaborate and learned commentary, with an interlinear version
of "the Song of the Sun," the reader may consult "Les Chants de Sol,"
by Professor Bergmann, Strasbourg & Paris, 1858.

1. Of life and property a fierce freebooter despoiled mankind; over
the ways beset by him might no one living pass.

2. Alone he ate most frequently, no one invited he to his repast;
until weary, and with failing strength, a wandering guest came from
the way.

3. In need of drink that way-worn man, and hungry feigned to be:
with trembling heart he seemed to trust him who had been so
evil-minded.

4. Meat and drink to the weary one he gave, all with upright heart;
on God he thought, the traveller's wants supplied; for he felt he was
an evil-doer.

5. Up stood the guest, he evil meditated, he had not been kindly
treated; his sin within him swelled, he while sleeping murdered his
wary cautious host.

6. The God of heaven he prayed for help, when being struck he woke;
but he was doomed the sins of him on himself to take, whom sackless he
had slain.

7. Holy angels came from heaven above, and took to them his soul: in
a life of purity it shall ever live with the almighty God.

8. Riches and health no one may command, though all go smoothly with
him. To many that befalls which they least expect. No one may command
his tranquillity.

9. Unnar and Sævaldi never imagined that happiness would fall from
them, yet naked they became, and of all bereft, and, like wolves, ran
to the forest.

10. The force of pleasure has many a one bewailed. Cares are often
caused by women; pernicious they become, although the mighty God them
pure created.

11. United were Svafud and Skarthedin, neither might without the
other be, until to frenzy they were driven for a woman: she was
destined for their perdition.

12. On account of that fair maid, neither of them cared for games or
joyous days; no other thing could they in memory bear than that bright
form.

13. Sad to them were the gloomy nights, no sweet sleep might they
enjoy: but from that anguish rose hate intense between the faithful
friends.

14. Hostile deeds are in most places fiercely avenged. To the holm
they went,[44] for that fair woman, and each one found his death.

15. Arrogance should no one entertain: I indeed have seen that those
who follow her, for the most part, turn from God.

16. Rich were both, Radey and Vebogi, and thought only of their
well-being; now they sit and turn their sores to various hearths.

17. They in themselves confided, and thought themselves alone to be
above all people; but their lot Almighty God was pleased otherwise to
appoint.

18. A life of luxury they led, in many ways, and had gold for
sport. Now they are requited, so that they must walk between frost and
fire.

19. To thy enemies trust thou never, although they speak thee fair:
promise them good: 'tis good to have another's injury as a warning.

20. So it befell Sorli the upright, when he placed himself in
Vigolf's power; he confidently trusted him, his brother's murderer,
but he proved false.

21. Peace to them he granted, with heart sincere; they in return
promised him gold, feigned themselves friends, while they together
drank; but then came forth their guile.

22. Then afterwards, on the second day, when they in Rygiardal rode,
they with swords wounded him who sackless was, and let his life go
forth.

23. His corpse they dragged (on a lonely way, and cut up piecemeal)
into a well, and would it hide; but the holy Lord beheld from heaven.

24. His soul summoned home the true God into his joy to come; but
the evil doers will, I wean, late be from torments called.

25. Do thou pray the Disir of the Lord's words to be kind to thee in
spirit: for a week after, all shall then go happily, according to thy
will.

26. For a deed of ire that thou hast perpetrated, never atone with
evil: the weeping thou shalt soothe with benefits: that is salutary to
the soul.

27. On God a man shall for good things call, on him who has mankind
created. Greatly sinful is every man who late finds the Father.

28. To be solicited, we opine, is with all earnestness for that
which is lacking: of all things may be destitute he who for nothing
asks: few heed the wants of the silent.

29. Late I came, though called betimes, to the supreme Judge's door;
thitherward I yearn; for it was promised me, he who craves it shall of
the feast partake.

30. Sins are the cause that sorrowing we depart from this world: no
one stands in dread, if he does no evil: good it is to be blameless.

31. Like unto wolves all those seem who have a faithless mind: so he
will prove who has to go through ways strewed with gleeds.

32. Friendly counsels, and wisely composed, seven I have imparted to
thee: consider thou them well, and forget them never: they are all
useful to learn.

33. Of that I will speak, how happy I was in the world, and
secondly, how the sons of men reluctantly become corpses.

34. Pleasure and pride deceive the sons of men who after money
crave; shining riches at last become a sorrow: many have riches driven
to madness.

35. Steeped in joys I seemed to men; for little did I see before me:
our worldly sojourn has the Lord created in delights abounding.

36. Bowed down I sat, long I tottered, of life was most desirous;
but He prevailed who was all-powerful: onward are the ways of the
doomed.

37. The cords of Hel were tightly bound round my sides; I would rend
them, but they were strong. 'Tis easy free to go.

38. I alone knew, how on all sides my pains increased. The maids of
Hel each eve with horror bade me to their home.

39. The sun I saw, true star of day, sink in its roaring home; but
Hel's grated doors on the other side I heard heavily creaking.

40. The sun I saw with blood-red beams beset: (fast was I then from
this world declining) mightier she appeared, in many ways, than she
was before.

41. The sun I saw, and it seemed to me as if I saw a glorious god: I
bowed before her, for the last time, in the world of men.

42. The sun I saw: she beamed forth so that I seemed nothing to
know; but Gioll's streams roared from the other side mingled much with
blood.

43. The sun I saw, with quivering eyes, appalled and shrinking; for
my heart in great measure was dissolved in languor.

44. The sun I saw seldom sadder; I had then almost from the world
declined: my tongue was as wood become, and all was cold without me.

45. The sun I saw never after, since that gloomy day; for the
mountain-waters closed over me, and I went called from torments.

46. The star of hope, when I was born, fled from my breast away;
high it flew, settled nowhere, so that it might find rest.

47. Longer than all was that one night, when stiff on my straw I
lay; then becomes manifest the divine word: "Man is the same as
earth."

48. The Creator God can it estimate and know, (He who made heaven
and earth) how forsaken many go hence, although from kindred parted.

49. Of his works each has the reward: happy is he who does good. Of
my wealth bereft, to me was destined a bed strewed with sand.

50. Bodily desires men oftentimes seduce, of them has many a one too
much: water of baths was of all things to me most loathsome.

51. In the Norns' seat nine days I sat, thence I was mounted on a
horse: there the giantess's sun shone grimly through the dripping
clouds of heaven.

52. Without and within, I seemed to traverse all the seven nether
worlds: up and down, I sought an easier way, where I might have the
readiest paths.

53. Of that is to be told, which I first saw, when I to the worlds
of torment came:--scorched birds, which were souls, flew numerous as
flies.

54. From the west I saw Von's dragons fly, and Glæval's paths
obscure: their wings they shook; wide around me seemed the earth and
heaven to burst.

55. The sun's hart I saw from the south coming, he was by two
together led: his feet stood on the earth, but his horns reached up to
heaven.

56. From the north riding I saw the sons of Nidi, they were seven in
all: from full horns, the pure mead they drank from the heaven-god's
well.

57. The wind was silent, the waters stopped their course; then I
heard a doleful sound: for their husbands false-faced women ground
earth for food.

58. Gory stones those dark women turned sorrowfully; bleeding hearts
hung out of their breasts, faint with much affliction.

59. Many a man I saw wounded go on those gleed-strewed paths; their
faces seemed to me all reddened with reeking blood.

60. Many men I saw to earth gone down, who holy service might not
have; heathen stars stood above their heads, painted with deadly
characters.

61. I saw those men who much envy harbour at another's fortune;
bloody runes were on their breasts graved painfully.

62. I there saw men many not joyful; they were all wandering wild:
this he earns, who by this world's vices is infatuated.

63. I saw those men who had in various ways acquired other's
property: in shoals they went to Castle-covetous, and burthens bore of
lead.

64. I saw those men who many had of life and property bereft:
through the breasts of those men passed strong venomous serpents.

65. I saw those men who the holy days would not observe: their hands
were on hot stones firmly nailed.

66. I saw those men who from pride valued themselves too highly;
their garments ludicrously were in fire enveloped.

67. I saw those men who had many false words of others uttered:
Hel's ravens from their heads their eyes miserably tore.

68. All the horrors thou wilt not get to know which Hel's inmates
suffer. Pleasant sins end in painful penalties: pains ever follow
pleasure.

69. I saw those men who had much given for God's laws; pure lights
were above their heads brightly burning.

70. I saw those men who from exalted mind helped the poor to aid:
angels, read holy books above their heads.

71. I saw those men who with much fasting had their bodies wasted:
God's angels bowed before them: that is the highest joy.

72. I saw those men who had put food into their mothers' mouth:
their couches were on the rays of heaven pleasantly placed.

73. Holy virgins had cleanly washed the souls from sin of those men,
who for a long time had themselves tormented.

74. Lofty cars I saw towards heaven going; they were on the way to
God: men guided them who had been murdered wholly without crime.

75. Almighty Father! greatest Son! holy Spirit of heaven! Thee I
pray, who hast us all created; free us all from miseries.

76. Biugvor and Iyistvor sit at Herdir's doors, on resounding seat;
iron gore falls from their nostrils, which kindles hate among men.

77. Odin's wife rows in earth's ship, eager after pleasures; her
sails are reefed late, which on the ropes of desire are hung.

78. Son! I thy father and Solkatla's sons have alone obtained for
thee that horn of hart, which from the grave-mound bore the wise
Vigdvalin.

79. Here are runes which have engraven Niord's daughters nine,
Radvor the eldest, and the youngest Kreppvor, and their seven sisters.

80. How much violence have they perpetrated Svaf and Svaflogi!
bloodshed they have excited, and wounds have sucked, after an evil
custom.

81. This lay, which I have taught thee, thou shalt before the living
sing, the Sun-Song, which will appear in many parts no fiction.

82. Here we part, but again shall meet on the day of men's
rejoicing. Oh Lord! unto the dead grant peace, and to the living
comfort.

83. Wondrous lore has in dream to thee been sung, but thou hast seen
the truth: no man has been so wise created that has before heard the
Sun-song.

THE LAY OF VOLUND.

There was a king in Sweden named Nidud: he had two sons and a
daughter, whose name was Bodvild. There were three brothers, sons of a
king of the Finns, one was called Slagfid, the second Egil, the third
Volund. They went on snow-shoes and hunted wild-beasts. They came to
Ulfdal, and there made themselves a house, where there is a water
called Ulfsiar. Early one morning they found on the border of the lake
three females sitting and spinning flax. Near them lay their
swan-plumages: they were Valkyriur. Two of them, Hladgud-Svanhvit and
Hervor-Alvit, were daughters of King Hlodver; the third was Olrun, a
daughter of Kiar of Valland. They took them home with them to their
dwelling. Egil had Olrun, Slagfid Svanhvit, and Volund Alvit. They
lived there seven years, when they flew away seeking conflicts, and
did not return. Egil then went on snow-shoes in search of Olrun, and
Slagfid in search of Svanhvit, but Volund remained in Ulfdal. He was a
most skilful man, as we learn from old traditions. King Nidud ordered
him to be seized, so as it is here related.

1. Maids flew from the south, through the murky wood, Alvit the
young, fate to fulfil. On the lake's margin they sat to repose, the
southern damsels; precious flax they spun.

2. One of them, of maidens fairest, to his comely breast Egil
clasped. Svanhvit was the second, she a swan's plumage bore; but the
third, their sister, the white neck clasped of Volund.

3. There they stayed seven winters through; but all the eighth were
with longing seized; and in the ninth fate parted them. The maidens
yearned for the murky wood, the young Alvit, fate to fulfil.

4. From the chase came the ardent hunters, Slagfid and Egil, found
their house deserted, went out and in, and looked around. Egil went
east after Olrun, and Slagfid west after Svanhvit;

5. But Volund alone remained in Ulfdal. He the red gold set with the
hard gem, well fastened all the rings on linden bast, and so awaited
his bright consort, if to him she would return.

6. It was told to Nidud, the Niarars' lord, that Volund alone
remained in Ulfdal. In the night went men, in studded corslets, their
shields glistened in the waning moon.

7. From their saddles they alighted at the house's gable, thence
went in through the house. On the bast they saw the rings all drawn,
seven hundred, which the warrior owned.

8. And they took them off, and they put them on, all save one, which
they bore away. Came then from the chase the ardent hunter, Volund,
gliding[45] on the long way.

9. To the fire he went, bear's flesh to roast. Soon blazed the
brushwood, and the arid fir, the wind-dried wood, before Volund.

10. On the bearskin sat, his rings counted, the Alfar's companion:
one was missing. He thought that Hlodver's daughter had it, the young
Alvit, and that she was returned.

11. So long he sat until he slept; and he awoke of joy bereft: on
his hands he felt heavy constraints, and round his feet fetters
clasped.

12. "Who are the men that on the rings' possessor have laid bonds?
and me have bound?"

13. Then cried Nidud, the Niarars' lord: "Whence gottest thou,
Volund! Alfars' chief![46] our gold, in Ulfdal?"

14. "No gold was here in Grani's path, far I thought our land from
the hills of Rhine. I mind me that we more treasures possessed, when,
a whole family, we were at home.

15. Hladgud and Hervor were of Hlodver born; known was Olrun, Kiar's
daughter, she entered into the house, stood on the floor, her voice
moderated: Now is he not mirthful, who from the forest comes."

King Nidud gave to his daughter Bodvild the ring which had been taken
from the bast in Volund's house; but he himself bore the sword that
had belonged to Volund. The queen said:

16. His teeth he shows, when the sword he sees, and Bodvild's ring
he recognizes: threatening are his eyes as a glistening serpent's: let
be severed his sinews' strength; and set him then in Sævarstad.

This was done; he was hamstrung, and then set on a certain small
island near the shore, called Sævarstad. He there forged for the king
all kinds of jewellery work. No one was allowed to go to him, except
the king. Volund said:

17. "The sword shines in Nidud's belt, which I whetted as I could
most skilfully, and tempered, as seemed to me most cunningly. That
bright blade forever is taken from me: never shall I see it borne into
Volund's smithy.

18. Now Bodvild wears my consort's red-gold rings: for this I have
no indemnity." He sat and never slept, and his hammer plied; but much
more speedy vengeance devised on Nidud.

19. The two young sons of Nidud ran in at the door to look, in
Sævarstad. To the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was
their grudge, when therein they looked.

20. Many necklaces were there, which to those youths appeared of the
red gold to be, and treasures. "Come ye two alone, to-morrow come;
that gold shall be given to you.

21. Tell it not to the maidens, nor to the household folk, nor to
any one, that ye have been with me." Early called one the other,
brother, brother: "Let us go see the rings."

22. To the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was their
grudge, when therein they looked. Of those children he the heads cut
off, and under the prison's mixen laid their bodies.

23. But their skulls beneath the hair he in silver set, and to Nidud
gave; and of their eyes precious stones he formed, which to Nidud's
wily wife he sent.

24. But of the teeth of the two breast-ornaments he made, and to
Bodvild sent. Then did Bodvild praise the ring: to Volund brought it,
when she had broken it: "I dare to no tell it, save alone to thee."

_Volund_.

25. "I will so repair the fractured gold, that to thy father it
shall fairer seem, and to thy mother much more beautiful, and to
thyself, in the same degree."

26. He then brought her beer, that he might succeed the better, as
on her seat she fell asleep. "Now have I my wrongs avenged, all save
one in the wood perpetrated."[47]

27. "I wish," said Volund, "that on my feet I were, of the use of
which Nidud's men have deprived me." Laughing Volund rose in air:
Bodvild weeping from the isle departed. She mourned her lover's
absence, and for her father's wrath.

28. Stood without Nidud's wily wife; then she went in through the
hall; but he on the enclosure sat down to rest. "Art thou awake
Niarars' lord!"

29. "Ever am I awake, joyless I lie to rest, when I call to mind my
children's death: my head is chilled, cold are to me thy counsels.
Now with Volund I desire to speak."

30. "Tell me, Volund, Alfars' chief! of my brave boys what is
become?"

31. "Oaths shalt thou first to me swear, by board of ship, by rim of
shield, by shoulder of steed, by edge of sword, that thou wilt not
slay the wife of Volund, nor of my bride cause the death; although a
wife I have whom ye know, or offspring within thy court.

32. To the smithy go, which thou hast made, there wilt thou the
bellows find with blood besprinkled. The heads I severed of thy boys,
and under the prison's mixen laid their bodies.

33. But their skulls beneath the hair I in silver set, and to Nidud
gave; and of their eyes precious stones I formed, which to Nidud's
wily wife I sent.

34. Of the teeth of the two, breast-ornaments I made, and to Bodvild
sent. Now Bodvild goes big with child, the only daughter of you both."

35. "Word didst thou never speak that more afflicted me, or for
which I would more severely punish thee. There is no man so tall that
he from thy horse can take thee, or so skilful that he can shoot thee
down, thence where thou floatest up in the sky."

36. Laughing Volund rose in air, but Nidud sad remained sitting.

37. "Rise up Thakrad, my best of thralls! bid Bodvild, my
fair-browed daughter, in bright attire come, with her sire to speak.

38. Is it, Bodvild! true what has been told to me, that thou and
Volund in the isle together sat?"

39. "True it is, Nidud! what has been told to thee, that Volund and
I in the isle together sat, in an unlucky hour: would it had never
been! I could not against him strive, I might not against him
prevail."

[Footnote 46: The designation of Alfars' chief, or prince, applied to
Volund, who, as we learn from the prose introduction, was a son of a
king of the Finns, may perhaps be accounted for by the circumstance
that the poem itself hardly belongs to the Odinic Mythology, and was
probably composed when that system was in its decline and giving place
to the heroic or romantic.]

THE LAY OF HELGI HIORVARD'S SON.

There was a king named Hiorvard, who had four wives, one of whom was
named Alfhild, their son was named Hedin; the second was named Særeid,
their son was Humlung; the third was named Sinriod, their son was
Hymling. King Hiorvard made a vow that he would have to wife the most
beautiful woman he knew of, and was told that King Svafnir had a
daughter of incomparable beauty, named Sigrlinn. He had a jarl named
Idmund, whose son Atli was sent to demand the hand of Sigrlinn for the
king. He stayed throughout the winter with King Svafnir. There was a
jarl there named Franmar, who was the foster-father of Sigrlinn, and
had a daughter named Alof. This jarl advised that the maiden should be
refused, and Atli returned home. One day when the jarl's son Atli was
standing in a grove, there was a bird sitting in the boughs above him,
which had heard that his men called the wives which King Hiorvard had
the most beautiful. The bird talked, and Atli listened to what it
said. The bird said:

1. Hast thou seen Sigrlinn, Svafnir's daughter, of maidens fairest,
in her pleasant home? though fair the wives of Hiorvard seem to men in
Glasis-lund.

_Atli._

2. With Atli, Idmund's son, sagacious bird! wilt thou further speak?

_Bird._

I will if the prince will offer to me, and I may choose what I will
from the king's court.

_Atli._

3. Choose not Hiorvard nor his sons, nor the fair daughters of that
prince, nor the wives which the king has. Let us together bargain;
that is the part of friends.

_Bird._

4. A fane I will chose, offer steads many, gold-horned cows from the
chief's land, if Sigrlinn sleep in his arms, and unconstrained with
that prince shall live.

This took place before Atli's journey; but after his return, when the
king asked his tidings, he said:

5. Labour we have had, but errand none performed; our horses failed
us in the vast fell; we had afterwards a swampy lake to ford; then was
denied us Svafnir's daughter with rings adorned, whom we would obtain.

The king commanded them to go a second time, and also went himself.
But when they had ascended a fell, and saw in Svavaland the country on
fire, and a great reek from the horses of cavalry, the king rode down
the fell into the country, and took up his night-quarters by a river.
Atli kept watch, and crossed the river, and came to a house, on which
sat a great bird to guard it, but was asleep. Atli shot the bird dead
with an arrow. In the house he found the king's daughter Sigrlinn, and
Alof daughter of Franmar, and brought them both away with him. The
jarl Franmar had taken the form of an eagle, and protected them from a
hostile army by sorcery. There was a king named Hrodmar, a wooer of
Sigrlinn: he had slain the king of Svavaland, and ravaged and burnt
the country. Hiorvard obtained Sigrlinn, and Atli Alof. Hiorvard and
Sigrlinn had a son tall and comely: he was taciturn and had no fixed
name. As he was sitting on a mound he saw nine Valkyriur, one of whom
was of most noble aspect. She said:

6. Late wilt thou, Helgi! rings possess, a potent warrior, or
Rodulsvellir,--so at morn the eagle sang--if thou art ever silent;
although thou, prince! a fierce mood mayest show.

_Helgi_.

7. What wilt thou let accompany the name of Helgi, maid of aspect
bright! since that thou art pleased to give me? Think well over what
thou art saying. I will not accept it, unless I have thee also.

_Valkyria_.

8. Swords I know lying in Sigarsholm, fewer by four than five times
ten: one of them is of all the best, of shields the bale, with gold
adorned.

9. A ring is on the hilt, courage in the midst, in the point terror
for his use who owns it: along the edge a blood-stained serpent lies,
and on the guard the serpent casts its tail.

There was a king named Eylimi; Svava was his daughter; she was a
Valkyria and rode through air and water. It was she who gave Helgi
that name, and afterwards often protected him in battle. Helgi said:

10. Hiorvard! thou art not a king of wholesome counsel, leader of
people! renowned though thou mayest be. Thou hast let fire devour the
homes of princes, though harm to thee they none have done.

11. But Hrodmar shall of the rings dispose, which our relations have
possessed. That chief recks little of his life; he thinks only to
obtain the heritage of the dead.

Hiorvard answers, that he will supply Helgi with an army, if he will
avenge his mother's father. Helgi thereupon seeks the sword that Svava
had indicated to him. Afterwards he and Atli went and slew Hrodmar,
and performed many deeds of valour. He killed the Jotun Hati, as he
sat on a crag. Helgi and Atli lay with their ships in Hatafiord. Atli
kept watch in the first part of the night. Hrimgerd, Hati's daughter,
said:

12. Who are the chieftains in Hatafiord? With shields are your ships
bedecked; boldly ye bear yourselves, few things ye fear, I ween: tell
me how your king is named.

_Atli_.

13. Helgi is his name; but thou nowhere canst to the chief do harm;
iron forts are around the prince's fleet; giantesses may not assail
us.

_Hrimgerd_.

14. How art thou named? most powerful champion! How do men call
thee? Thy king confides in thee, since in the ship's fair prow he
grants thee place.

_Atli_.

15. Atli I am named, fierce I shall prove to thee; towards
giantesses I am most hostile. The humid prow I have oft occupied, and
the night-riders slain.

16. How art thou called? corpse-greedy giantess! hag! name thy
father. Nine rasts shouldst thou be underground, and a forest grow on
thy breast.

_Hrimgerd_.

17. Hrimgerd I am called, Hati was my father called, whom I knew the
mightiest Jotun. He many women had from their dwellings taken, until
him Helgi slew.

_Atli_.

18. Thou wast, hag! before the prince's ships, and layest before
them in the fiord's mouth. The chieftain's warriors thou wouldst to
Ran consign, had a bar not crossed thee.

_Hrimgerd_.

19. Now, Atli! thou art wrong, methinks thou art dreaming; thy brows
thou lettest over thy eyelids fall. My mother lay before the prince's
ships; I Hlodvard's sons drowned in the ocean.

20. Thou wouldst neigh, Atli! if thou wert not a gelding. See!
Hrimgerd cocks her tail. Thy heart, methinks, Atli! is in thy hinder
part, although thy voice is clear.

_Atli_.

21. I think I shall the stronger prove, if thou desirest to try;
and I can step from the port to land. Thou shalt be soundly cudgeled,
if I heartily begin, and let thy tail fall, Hrimgerd!

_Hrimgerd_.

22. Just come on shore, Atli! if in thy strength thou trustest, and
let us meet in Varinsvik. A rib-roasting thou shalt get, brave boy! if
in my claws thou comest.

_Atli_.

23. I will not come before the men awake, and o'er the king hold
watch. It would not surprise me, if from beneath our ship some hag
arose.

_Hrimgerd_.

24. Keep watch, Atli! and to Hrimgerd pay the blood-fine for Hati's
death. If one night she may sleep with the prince, she for the slain
will be indemnified.

_Helgi_.

25. Lodin is named he who shall thee possess, thou to mankind art
loathsome. In Tholley dwells that Thurs, that dog-wise Jotun, of all
rock-dwellers the worst: he is a fitting man for thee.

_Hrimgerd_.

26. Helgi would rather have her who last night guarded the port and
men, the gold-bright maiden. She methought had strength, she stept
from port to land, and so secured your fleet. She was alone the cause
that I could not the king's men slay.

_Helgi_.

27. Hear now, Hrimgerd! If I may indemnify thee, say fully to the
king: was it one being only, that saved the prince's ships, or went
many together?

_Hrimgerd_.

28. Three troops of maidens; though one maid foremost rode, bright,
with helmed head. Their horses shook themselves, and from their manes
there sprang dew into the deep dales, hail on the lofty trees, whence
comes fruitfulness to man. To me all that I saw was hateful.

_Atli_.

29. Look eastward now, Hrimgerd! whether Helgi has not stricken thee
with death-bearing words. By land and water the king's fleet is safe,
and the chief's men also.

30. It is now day, Hrimgerd! and Atli has thee detained to thy loss
of life. A ludicrous haven-mark 'twill, indeed, be, where thou a
stone-image standest.

King Helgi was a renowned warrior. He came to King Eylimi and demanded
his daughter Svava. Helgi and Svava were united, and loved each other
ardently. Svava remained at home with her father, but Helgi was
engaged in warfare. Svava was a Valkyria as before. Hedin was at home
with his father, King Hiorvard in Norway. Returning home alone from
the forest on a Yule-eve, Hedin met a troll-wife riding on a wolf,
with serpents for reins, who offered to attend him, but he declined
her offer; whereupon she said: "Thou shalt pay for this at the
Bragi-cup." In the evening solemn vows were made, and the son-hog was
led forth, on which the guests laid their hands, and then made solemn
vows at the Bragi-cup.[48] Hedin bound himself by a vow to possess
Svava, the beloved of his brother Helgi; but repented it so bitterly
that he left home and wandered through wild paths to the southern
lands, and there found his brother Helgi. Helgi said:

31. Welcome art thou, Hedin! What new tidings canst thou give from
Norway? Why art thou, prince! from the land driven, and alone art come
to find us?

_Hedin_.

32. Of a much greater crime I am guilty. I have chosen a royal
daughter, thy bride, at the Bragi-cup.

_Helgi_.

33. Accuse not thyself; true will prove words at drinking uttered by
us both. Me a chieftain has to the strand summoned; within three
nights I must be there. 'Tis to me doubtful whether I return; then may
well such befall, if it so must be.

_Hedin_.

34. Thou saidst, Helgi! that Hedin well deserved of thee, and great
gifts: It would beseem thee better thy sword to redden, than to grant
peace to thy foes.

Helgi so spoke, for he had a foreboding that his death was at hand,
and that his fylgiur (attendant spirit) had accosted Hedin, when he
saw the woman riding on a wolf. There was a king named Alf, a son of
Hrodmar, who had appointed a place of combat with Helgi in Sigar's
plain within three days. Then said Helgi:

35. On a wolf rode, at evening twilight, a woman who him offered to
attend. She well knew, that the son of Sigrlinn would be slain, on
Sigar's plain.

There was a great conflict, in which Helgi got his death-wound.

36. Helgi sent Sigar riding, after Eylimi's only daughter: he bade
her quickly be in readiness, if she would find the king alive.

_Sigar_.

37. Helgi has me hither sent, with thee, Svava! thyself to speak.
Thee, said the king, he fain would see, ere the noble-born breathes
forth his last.

_Svava_.

38. What has befallen Helgi, Hiorvard's son? I am sorely by
afflictions stricken. Has the sea him deluded, or the sword wounded?
On that man I will harm inflict.

_Sigar_.

39. This morning fell, at Frekastein, the king who beneath the sun
was of all the best. Alf has complete victory, though this time it
should not have been!

_Helgi_.

40. Hail to thee, Svava! Thy love thou must divide: this in this
world, methinks, is our last meeting. They say the chieftain's wounds
are bleeding. The sword came too near my heart.

41. I pray thee, Svava!--weep not, my wife!--if thou wilt my voice
obey, that for Hedin thou a couch prepare, and the young prince in thy
arms clasp.

_Svava_.

42. I had said, in our pleasant home, when for me Helgi rings
selected, that I would not gladly, after my king's departure, an
unknown prince clasp in my arms.

_Hedin_.

43. Kiss me, Svava! I will not return, Rogheim to behold, nor
Rodulsfioll, before I have avenged Hiorvard's son, who was of kings
under the sun the best.

Helgi and Svava were, it is said, born again.

FOOTNOTES:

[Footnote 48: At guilds the Bragi-cup (Bragafull) was drunk. It was
the custom at the funeral feast of kings and jarls, that the heir
should sit on a lower seat, until the Bragafull was brought in, that
he should then rise to receive it, make a vow, and drink the contents
of the cup (full). He was then led to his father's high seat. At an
offering guild, the chief signed with the figure of Thor's hammer both
the cup and the meat. First was drunk Odin's cup, for victory and
power to the king; then Niord's cup, and Frey's, for a good year and
peace; after which it was the custom with many to drink a Bragafull.
The peculiarity of this cup was, that it was a cup of vows, that on
drinking it a vow was made to perform some great and arduous deed,
that might be made a subject for the song of the skalld.]


THE FIRST LAY OF HELGI HUNDINGCIDE.

1. It was in times of yore, when the eagles screamed, holy waters
fell from the heavenly hills; then to Helgi, the great of soul,
Borghild gave birth in Bralund.

2. In the mansion it was night: the Norns came, who should the
prince's life determine. They him decreed a prince most famed to be,
and of leaders accounted best.

3. With all their might they span the fatal threads, when that [he]
burghs should overthrow[49] in Bralund. They stretched out the golden
cord, and beneath the middle of the moon's mansion fixed it.

4. East and west they hid the ends, where the prince had lands
between; towards the north Neri's sister cast a chain, which she bade
last for ever.

5. One thing disquieted the Ylfing's offspring, and the woman who
had the child brought forth. Sitting on a lofty tree, on prey intent,
a raven to a raven said: "I know something.

6. Stands cased in mail Sigmund's son, one day old: now is our day
come. His eyes are piercing as a warrior's; the wolf's friend is he:
we shall rejoice!"

7. He to the folk appeared a noble chief to be; among men 'twas said
that happy times were come; went the king himself from the din of war,
noble garlic to bring to the young prince;

8. Gave him the name of Helgi, and Hringstadir, Solfioll, Snæfioll,
and Sigarsvellir, Hringstad, Hatun, and Himinvangar, a sword ornate,
to Sinfiotli's brother.

9. Then grew up, in his friends' bosom, the high-born youth, in
joyous splendour. He paid and gave gold for deserts; nor spared the
chief the blood-stained sword.

10. A short time only the leader let warfare cease. When the prince
was fifteen winters old, he caused the fierce Hunding to fall, who
long had ruled over lands and people.

11. The sons of Hunding afterwards demanded from Sigmund's son
treasure and rings; because they had on the prince to avenge their
great loss of wealth, and their father's death.

12. The prince would neither the blood-fine pay, nor for the slain
indemnity would give. They might expect, he said, a terrific storm of
grey arrows, and Odin's ire.

13. The warriors went to the trysting place of swords, which they
had appointed at Logafioll. Broken was Frodi's peace between the foes:
Vidrir's hounds went about the isle slaughter-greedy.

14. The leader sat under the Arastein, after he had slain Alf and
Eyiolf, Hiorvard and Havard, sons of Hunding: he had destroyed all
Geirmimir's race.

15. Then gleamed a ray from Logafioll, and from that ray lightnings
issued; then appeared, in the field of air, a helmed band of
Valkyriur: their corslets were with blood besprinkled, and from their
spears shone beams of light.

16. Forthwith inquired the chieftain bold, from the wolf-congress of
the southern Disir, whether they would, with the warriors, that night
go home?--then was a clash of arms!

17. One from her horse, Hogni's daughter, stilled the crash of
shields, and to the leader said: "We have, I ween, other objects than
with princely warriors to drink beer.

18. My father has his daughter promised to the fierce son of
Granmar; but I have, Helgi! declared Hodbrodd, the proud prince, like
to a cat's son.

19. That chief will come in a few days, unless thou him call to a
hostile meeting; or the maiden take from the prince."

_Helgi_.

20. Fear thou not Isung's slayer; there shall be first a clash of
foes, unless I am dead.

21. Thence sent messengers the potent prince through air and over
water, succours to demand, and abundance of ocean's gleam to men to
offer, and to their sons.

22. "Bid them speedily to the ships to go, and those from Brandey to
hold them ready." There the king abode, until thither came warriors in
hundreds from Hedinsey.

23. From the strands also, and from Stafnsnes, a naval force went
out, with gold adorned. Helgi then of Hiorleif asked: "Hast thou
mustered the valiant people?"

24. But the young king the other answered: "Slowly" said he "are
counted from Tronuey the long-beaked ships, under the seafarers, which
sail without in the Oresund,--

25. Twelve hundred faithful men; though in Hatun there is more than
half of the king's host--We are to war inured."

26. Then the steersman threw the ship's tents aside, that the
princes' people might awake, and the noble chiefs the dawn might see;
and the warriors hauled the sails up to the mast in Varinsfiord.

27. There was a dash of oars, and clash of iron, shield against
shield resounded: the vikings rowed; roaring went, under the
chieftains the royal fleet far from the land.

28. So might be heard, when together came the tempest's sister[50]
and the long keels, as when rock and surge on each other break.

29. Higher still bade Helgi the deep sail be hauled. No port gave
shelter to the crews; when Oegir's terrific daughter the chieftains'
vessels would o'erwhelm,

30. But from above Sigrun intrepid, saved them and their fleet also;
from the hand of Ran powerfully was wrested the royal ship at
Gnipalund.

31. At eve they halted in Unavagar; the splendid ships might into
port have floated, but the crews, from Svarinshaug, in hostile mood,
espied the host.

32. Then demanded the god-born Gudmund: "Who is the chieftain that
commands the fleet, and that formidable force brings to our land?"

33. Sinfiotli said, slinging up on the yard a red-hued shield with
golden rim;--He at the strait kept watch, and able was to answer, and
with nobles words exchange--

34. "Tell it at eve, when you feed your pigs, and your dogs lead to
their food, that the Ylfings from the east are come, ready to fight at
Gnipalund.

35. Hodbrodd will Helgi find in the fleet's midst, a king hard to
make flee, who has oft the eagles sated, while thou wast at the mills,
kissing the thrall-wenches.

_Gudmund_.

36. Little dost thou remember of ancient saws, when of the noble
thou falsehoods utterest. Thou hast been eating wolves' dainties, and
of thy brother wast the slayer; wounds hast thou often sucked with
cold mouth; every where loathed, thou hast crawled in caverns.

_Sinfiotli_.

37. Thou wast a Valacrone in Varinsey, cunning as a fox, a spreader
of lies. Thou saidst thou no man wouldst ever marry, no corsleted
warrior, save Sinfiotli.

38. A mischievous crone wast thou, a giantess, a Valkyria, insolent,
monstrous, in Alfather's hall. All the Einheriar fought with each
other, deceitful woman! for thy sake. Nine wolves we begat in Sagunes;
I alone was father of them all.

_Gudmund_.

39. Father thou wast not of Fenriswolves, older than all, as far as
I remember; since by Gnipalund, the Thurs-maidens thee emasculated
upon Thorsnes.

40. Thou wast Siggeir's stepson, at home under the benches layest,
accustomed to the wolf's howl out in the forests: calamity of every
kind came over thee, when thou didst lacerate thy brother's breast.
Notorious thou mad'st thyself by thy atrocious works.

_Sinfiotli_.

41. Thou wast Grani's bride at Bravollr, hadst a golden bit, ready
for the course. Many a time have I ridden thee tired, hungry and
saddled, through the fells, thou hag!

_Gudmund_.

42. A graceless lad thou wast thought to be, when Gulnir's goats
thou didst milk. Another time thou wast a giantess's daughter, a
tattered wretch. Wilt thou a longer chat?

_Sinfiotli_.

43. I rather would at Frekastein the ravens cram with thy carcase,
than thy dogs lead to their meat, or thy hogs feed. May the fiend deal
with thee!

_Helgi_.

44. "Much more seemly, Sinfiotli! would it be for you both in battle
to engage, and the eagles gladden, than with useless words to contend,
however princes[51] may foster hate.

45. Not good to me appear Granmar's sons, yet 'tis right that
princes should speak the truth: they have shown, at Moinsheimar, that
they have courage to draw the sword."--

46. Rapidly they their horses made to run, Svipud and Svegiud, to
Solheimar, over dewy dales, dark mountain-sides; trembled the sea of
mist, where the men went.

47. The king they met at the burgh's gate, to the prince announced
the hostile advent. Without stood Hodbrodd with helmet decked: he the
speed noticed of his kinsmen. "Why have ye Hniflungs such wrathful
countenances?"

48. "Hither to the shore are come rapid keels, towering masts, and
long yards, shields many, and smooth-shaven oars, a king's noble host,
joyous Ylfings.

49. Fifteen bands are come to land; but there are out at sea, before
Gnipalund, seven thousand blue-black ocean-beasts with gold adorned;
there is by far their greatest multitude. Now will Helgi not delay the
conflict."

_Hodbrodd_.

50. "Let a bridled steed to the chief assembly run, but Sporvitnir
to Sparinsheid; Melnir and Mylnir to Myrkvid; let no man stay behind
of those who swords can brandish.

51. Summon to you Hogni, and the sons of Hring, Atli and Yngvi, Alf
the old; they will gladly engage in conflict. We will let the Volsungs
find resistance."

52. It was a whirlwind, when together came the fallow[52] blades at
Frekastein: ever was Helgi Hundingsbani foremost in the host, where
men together fought: ardent for battle, disdaining flight; the
chieftain had a valiant heart.

53. Then came a maid from heaven, helmed, from above--the clash of
arms increased--for the king's protection. Then said Sigrun--well
skilled to fly to the host of heroes from Hugin's grove--[53]

54. "Unscathed shalt thou, prince! possess thy people, pillar of
Yngvi's race! and life enjoy; thou hast laid low the slow of flight,
the chief who caused the dread warrior's death. And thee, O king! well
beseem both red-gold rings and a powerful maid: unscathed shalt thou,
prince! both enjoy, Hogni's daughter, and Hringstadir, victory and
lands: then is conflict ended."

THE SECOND LAY OF HELGI HUNDINGCIDE.

King Sigmund, son of Volsung, had to wife Borghild of Bralund. They
named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hiorvard's son. Helgi was fostered
by Hagal. There was a powerful king named Hunding, after whom the land
was called Hundland. He was a great warrior, and had many sons, who
were engaged in warfare. There was enmity, both open and concealed,
between King Hunding and King Sigmund, and they slew each other's
kinsmen. King Sigmund and his kindred were called Volsungs, and
Ylfings. Helgi went forth and secretly explored the court of King
Hunding. Heming, Hunding's son, was at home. On departing Helgi met a
herdsman, and said:

1. "Say thou to Heming, that Helgi bears in mind who the mailed
warrior was, whom the men laid low, when the grey wolf ye had within,
and King Hunding thought it was Hamal."

Hamal was the son of Hagal. King Hunding sent men to Hagal in search
of Helgi, and Helgi had no other way to save himself than by taking
the clothes of a female slave and going to grind. They sought but did
not find him. Then said Blind the Baleful:

2. Sharp are the eyes of Hagal's thrall-wench; of no churlish race
is she who at the mill stands. The millstones are split, the receiver
flies asunder. Now a hard fate has befallen the warrior, when a prince
must barley grind: much more fitting to that hand is the falchion's
hilt than a mill-handle.

Hagal answered and said:--

3. No wonder 'tis that the receiver rattles, when a royal damsel the
handle turns. She hovered higher than the clouds, and, like the
vikings, dared to fight, until Helgi made her captive. She is a sister
of Sigar and Hogni; therefore has fierce eyes the Ylfing maid.

Helgi escaped and went on board a ship of war. He slew King Hunding,
and was afterwards named Helgi Hundingsbani. He lay with his force in
Brunavagar, and carried on "strand-hogg"[54] and ate raw flesh. There
was a king named Hogni, whose daughter was Sigrun: she was a Valkyria,
and rode through the air and over the sea. She was Svava regenerated.
Sigrun rode to Helgi, and said:--

4. What men cause a ship along the coasts to float? where do ye
warriors a home possess? what await ye in Brunavagar? whither desire
ye to explore a way?

_Helgi_.

5. Hamal causes a ship along the coasts to float; we have home in
Hlesey; a fair wind we await in Brunavagar; eastward we desire to
explore a way.

_Sigrun_.

6. Where, O prince! hast thou wakened war, or fed the birds of
conflict's sisters?[55] Why is thy corslet sprinkled with blood? Why
beneath the helm eat ye raw flesh?

_Helgi_.

7. It was the Ylfings' son's last achievement,--if thou desirest to
know--west of the ocean, that I took bears in Bragalund, and the
eagles' race with our weapons sated. Now, maiden! I have said what the
reasons were, why at sea we little cooked meat ate.

_Sigrun_.

8. To a battle thou alludest. Before Helgi has King Hunding been
doomed to fall. In conflict ye have engaged, when your kindred ye
avenged, and stained with blood the falchion's edge.

_Helgi_.

9. Why dost thou suppose, sagacious maiden! that it was they, who
their kin avenged? Many a warrior's bold sons there are, and hostile
to our kindred.

_Sigrun_.

10. I was not far, leader of people! eager, at many a chieftain's
end: yet crafty I account Sigmund's son, when in val-runes[56] the
slaughter he announces.

11. A while ago I saw thee commanding the warships, when thou hadst
station on the bloody prow, and the cold sea waves were playing. Now,
prince! thou wilt from me conceal it, but Hogni's daughter recognizes
thee.

Granmar was the name of a powerful prince who dwelt at Svarinshaug. He
had many sons: one was called Hodbrodd, the second Gudmund, the third
Starkadr. Hodbrodd was at the assembly of kings, and there betrothed
himself to Sigrun, the daughter of Hogni. But when she was informed of
it, she rode with the Valkyriur through the air and over the sea in
quest of Helgi. Helgi was at that time at Logafioll, warring against
the sons of Hunding, where he slew Alf and Eyiolf, Hiorvard and
Hervard. Being over-fatigued with the conflict, he was sitting under
the Arastein, where Sigrun found him, and running to him, threw her
arms around his neck, and, kissing him, told him her errand so as it
related in the first Volsungakvida.

12. Sigrun sought the joyous prince, Helgi's hand she forthwith
grasped, kissed and addressed the helm-decked king.

13. Then was the chieftain's mind to the lady turned. She declared
that she had loved, with her whole heart, Sigmund's son, before she
had seen him.

14. "To Hodbrodd I was in th' assembly betrothed, but I another
prince would have: yet, chieftain! I foresee my kindred's wrath: I
have my father's promise broken."

15. Hogni's daughter spoke not at variance with her heart: she said
that Helgi's affection she must possess.

_Helgi_.

16. Care thou not for Hogni's wrath, nor for the evil mind of thy
kin. Thou shalt, young maiden! live with me: of a good race thou art,
as I perceive.

Helgi then collected a large fleet and proceeded to Frekastein, and at
sea experienced a perilous storm. Lightnings came over them, and the
flashes entered the ships. They saw that nine Valkyriur were riding in
the air, and recognized Sigrun among them. The storm then abated and
they reached land in safety. The sons of Granmar were sitting on a
hill as the ships were sailing towards the land. Gudmund leapt on a
horse, and rode to explore on the hill by the haven. The Volsungs then
lowered their sails, and Gudmund spoke as is before written in the
Helgakvida:--

"Who is the leader that commands the fleet, and an appalling host
leads to our land?"

This said Gudmund, Granmar's son:

17. Who is the warrior that commands the ships, and lets his golden
banner wave o'er his prow? No peace seems to me in that ship's front;
it casts a warlike glow around the vikings.

Sinfiotli, Sigmund's son, answered:

18. Here may Hodbrodd Helgi learn to know, the hard of flight, in
the fleet's midst: he the possession holds of thy race; he the fishes'
heritage has to him subjected.

_Gudmund_.

19. Therefore ought we first, at Frekastein, to settle together, and
decide our quarrels! Hodbrodd! 'tis time vengeance to take, if an
inferior lot we long have borne.

_Sinfiotli_.

20. Rather shalt thou, Gudmund! tend goats, and steep mountain-tops
shalt climb, have in thy hand a hazel staff, that will better please
thee than judgments of the sword.

Gudmund rode home with intelligence of the hostile armament; whereupon
the sons of Granmar collected a host, and many kings came thither.
Among them were Hogni, the father of Sigrun, with his sons, Bragi and
Dag. There was a great battle, and all the sons of Hogni, and all
their chiefs were slain, except Dag, who obtained peace, and swore
oaths to the Volsungs. Sigrun, going among the slain, found Hodbrodd
at the point of death. She said:

23. Not will Sigrun of Sefafioll, King Hodbrodd! sink in thy arms:
thy life is departed. Oft the axe's blade the head approaches of
Granmar's sons.

She then met Helgi, and was overjoyed. He said:

24. Not to thee, all-wise maiden! are all things granted, though, I
say, in somewhat are the Norns to blame. This morn have fallen at
Frekastein Bragi and Hogni: I was their slayer.

25. But at Styrkleifar King Starkadr, and at Hlebiorg the son of
Hrollaug. That prince I saw of all most fierce, whose trunk yet fought
when the head was far.

26. On the earth lie the greater number of thy kinsmen, to corpses
turned. Thou hast not fought the battle, yet 'twas decreed, that thou,
potent maiden! shouldst cause the strife.

Sigrun then wept. Helgi said:

27. Sigrun! console thyself; a Hild thou hast been to us. Kings
cannot conquer fate: gladly would I have them living who are departed,
if I might clasp thee to my breast.

Helgi obtained Sigrun, and they had sons. Helgi lived not to be old.
Dag, the son of Hogni, sacrificed to Odin, for vengeance for his
father. Odin lent Dag his spear. Dag met with his relation Helgi in a
place called Fioturlund, and pierced him through with his spear. Helgi
fell there, but Dag rode to the mountains and told Sigrun what had
taken place.

28. Loath am I, sister! sad news to tell thee; for unwillingly I
have my sister caused to weep. This morning fell, in Fioturlund, the
prince who was on earth the best, and on the necks of warriors stood.

_Sigrun_.

29. Thee shall the oaths all gnaw, which to Helgi thou didst swear,
at the limpid Leiptr's water, and at the cold dank wave-washed rock.

30. May the ship not move forward, which under thee should move,
although the wished-for wind behind thee blow. May the horse not run,
which under thee should run, although from enemies thou hast to flee!

31. May the sword not bite which thou drawest, unless it sing round
thy own head. Then would Helgi's death be on thee avenged, if a wolf
thou wert, out in the woods, of all good bereft, and every joy, have
no sustenance, unless on corpses thou shouldst spring.

_Dag_.

32. Sister! thou ravest, and hast lost thy wits, when on thy brother
thou callest down such miseries. Odin alone is cause of all the evil;
for between relatives he brought the runes of strife.

33. Thy brother offers thee rings of red gold, all Vandilsve and
Vigdalir: have half the land, thy grief to compensate, woman
ring-adorned! thou and thy sons.

_Sigrun_.

34. So happy I shall not sit at Sefafioll, neither at morn nor
night, as to feel joy in life, if o'er the people plays not the
prince's beam of light; if his war-steed runs not under the chieftain
hither, to the gold bit accustomed; if in the king I cannot rejoice.

35. So had Helgi struck with fear all his foes and their kindred, as
before the wolf the goats run frantic from the fell, of terror full.

36. So himself Helgi among warriors bore, as the towering ash is
among thorns, or as the fawn, moistened with dew, that more proudly
stalks than all the other beasts, and its horns glisten against the
sky.

A mound was raised for Helgi; but when he came to Valhall, Odin
offered him the rule over all jointly with himself. Helgi said:

37. Thou, Hunding! shalt for every man a foot-bath get, and fire
kindle; shalt bind the dogs, to the horses look, to the swine give
wash, ere to sleep thou goest.

A female slave passing at evening by Helgi's mound, saw him riding
towards it with many men:

38. Is it a delusion which methinks I see, or the powers'
dissolution, that ye, dead men, ride, and your horses with spurs urge
on, or to warriors is a home journey granted?

_Helgi_.

39. 'Tis no delusion which thou thinkst to see, nor of mankind the
end, although thou seest us, although our horses we with spurs urge
on, nor to warriors is a home-journey granted.

The slave went home and said to Sigrun:

40. Sigrun! go forth from Sefafioll, if the people's chief thou
desirest to meet. The mound is opened, Helgi is come, his wounds still
bleed; the prince prayed thee that thou wouldst still the trickling
blood.

Sigrun entered the mound to Helgi and said:

41. Now am I as glad, at our meeting, as the voracious hawks of
Odin, when they of slaughter know; of warm prey, or, dewy-feathered,
see the peep of day.

43. I will kiss my lifeless king, ere thou thy bloody corslet layest
aside. Thy hair is, Helgi! tumid with sweat of death; my prince is all
bathed in slaughter-dew; cold, clammy are the hands of Hogni's son.
How shall I, prince! for this make thee amends?

_Helgi_.

43. Thou art alone the cause,[57] Sigrun of Sefafioll! that Helgi is
with sorrow's dew suffused. Thou weepest, gold-adorned! cruel tears,
sun-bright daughter of the south! ere to sleep thou goest; each one
falls bloody on the prince's breast, wet, cold, and piercing, with
sorrow big.

44. We shall surely drink delicious draughts, though we have lost
life and lands. No one shall a song of mourning sing, though on my
breast he wounds behold. Now are women in the mound enclosed,
daughters of kings, with us the dead.

Sigrun prepares a bed in the mound.

35. Here, Helgi! have I for thee a peaceful couch prepared, for the
Ylfings' son. On thy breast I will, chieftain! repose, as in my hero's
lifetime I was wont.

_Helgi_.

46. Nothing I now declare unlooked for, at Sefafioll, late or early,
since in a corpse's arms thou sleepest, Hogni's fair daughter! in a
mound, and thou art living, daughter of kings!

47. Time 'tis for me to ride on the reddening ways: let the pale
horse tread the aerial path. I towards the west must go over
Vindhialm's bridge, ere Salgofnir awakens heroes.

Helgi and his attendants rode their way, but Sigrun and hers proceeded
to their habitation. The following evening Sigrun ordered her
serving-maid to hold watch at the mound; but at nightfall, when Sigrun
came thither, she said:

48. Now would he come, if he to come intended, Sigmund's son, from
Odin's halls. I think the hope lessens of the king's coming, since on
the ash's boughs the eagles sit, and all the folk to the dreams' tryst
are hastening.

_Serving-maid_.

49. Be not so rash alone to go, daughter of heroes! to the house of
draugs:[58] more powerful are, in the night-season, all dead warriors,
than in the light of day.

Sigrun's life was shortened by grief and mourning. It was a belief in
ancient times that men were regenerated, but that is now regarded as
an old crone's fancy. Helgi and Sigrun are said to have been
regenerated. He was then called Helgi Haddingiaskadi, and she Kara
Halfdan's daughter, as it is said in the songs of Kara; and she also
was a Valkyria.

SINFIOTLI'S END.

Sigmund Volsung's son was a king in Frankland. Sinfiotli was the
eldest of his sons, the second was Helgi, the third Hamund. Borghild,
Sigmund's wife, had a brother named Gunnar; but Sinfiotli her stepson
and Gunnar both courted one woman, on which account Sinfiotli slew
Gunnar. When he came home, Borghild bade him go away, but Sigmund
offered the blood-fine, which it was incumbent on her to accept. At
the funeral feast Borghild presented the beer: she took a large horn
full of poison, and offered it to Sinfiotli; who, when he looked into
the horn, and saw that there was poison in it, said to Sigmund: "the
drink ferments!" Sigmund took the horn and drank up the contents. It
is said that Sigmund was so strong that no poison could hurt him,
either outwardly or inwardly; but that all his sons could endure
poison outwardly. Borghild bore another horn to Sinfiotli, and prayed
him to drink, when all took place as before. Yet a third time she
offered him the horn, using reproachful words on his refusing to
drink. He said as before to Sigmund, but the latter answered: "Let it
pass through thy lips, my son." Sinfiotli drank and instantly died.
Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a long and narrow
firth, where there was a little vessel and one man in it. He offered
Sigmund to convey him over the firth; but when Sigmund had borne the
corpse into the vessel, the boat was full-laden. The man then said
that Sigmund should go before through the firth. He then pushed off
his boat and instantly departed.

King Sigmund sojourned long in Denmark, in Borghild's kingdom, after
having espoused her. He then went south to Frankland, to the kingdom
he there possessed. There he married Hiordis, the daughter of Eylimi.
Sigurd was their son. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of
Hunding. Hiordis was afterwards married to Alf, son of King Hialprek,
with whom Sigurd grew up in childhood. Sigmund and his sons exceeded
all other men in strength, and stature, and courage, and all
accomplishments, though Sigurd was foremost of all; and in old
traditions he is mentioned as excelling all men, and as the most
renowned of warlike kings.


THE FIRST LAY OF SIGURD FAFNICIDE, OR GRIPIR'S PROPHECY.

Gripir was the name of the son of Eylimi, the brother of Hiordis. He
ruled over lands, and was of all men wisest and prescient of the
future. Sigurd rode alone, and came to Gripir's dwelling. Sigurd was
of a distinguished figure. He found a man to address outside the hall,
whose name was Geitir. Sigurd applied to him, and asked:

1. Who here inhabits, in these towers? what nation's king do people
name him?

_Geitir_.

Gripir is named the chief of men, he who rules a firm realm and
people.

_Sigurd_.

2. Is the wise king of the land at home? Will the chief with me come
and converse? With him needs speech an unknown man: I desire speedily
Gripir to see.

_Geitir_.

3. The glad king will of Geitir ask, who the man is that demands
speech of Gripir.

_Sigurd_.

Sigurd I am named, born of Sigmund, and Hiordis is the chieftain's
mother.

4. Then went Geitir, Gripir to inform: "Here is a man without, a
stranger, come; of aspect he is most distinguished. He desires, king!
with thee to speak."

5. Goes from the hall the lord of men, and the stranger prince
kindly greets: "Welcome, Sigurd! better had it been earlier: but do
thou, Geitir! take charge of Grani."

6. They began to talk, and much to tell, when the sagacious men
together met. "Tell me, if thou knowest, my mother's brother! how will
Sigurd's life fall out?"

_Gripir_.

7. Thou wilt foremost be of men beneath the sun, exalted high above
every king; liberal of gold, but of flight sparing, of aspect comely,
and wise of words.

_Sigurd_.

8. Say thou, sage king! more than I ask, thou wise one, to Sigurd,
if thou thinkst to see it: what will first happen for my advancement,
when from thy dwelling I shall have departed?

_Gripir_.

9. First wilt thou, prince! avenge thy father, and for the wrongs of
Eylimi wilt retaliate; thou wilt the cruel sons of Hunding boldly lay
low; thou wilt have victory.

_Sigurd_.

10. Say, noble king! kinsman mine! with all forethought, as we hold
friendly converse; seest thou of Sigurd those bold achievements, that
will highest soar under heaven's regions?"

_Gripir_.

11. Thou alone wilt slay that glistening serpent, which greedy lies
on Gnitaheid; thou shalt of both the slayer be, Regin and Fafnir.
Gripir tells truly.

_Sigurd_.

12. Riches will abound, if I so bring conflict among men, as thou
for certain sayest. Apply thy mind, and at length say what will yet my
life befall.

_Gripir_.

13. Thou wilt find Fafnir's lair, and thence wilt take splendid
riches, with gold wilt load Grani's back. Thou wilt to Giuki ride, the
war-famed prince.

_Sigurd_.

14. Yet must thou, prince! in friendly speech, foresighted king!
more relate. I shall be Giuki's guest, and I shall thence depart: what
will next my life befall?

_Gripir_.

15. A king's daughter will on a mountain sleep, fair, in corslet
cased, after Helgi's death. Thou wilt strike with a keen sword, wilt
the corslet sever with Fafnir's bane.

_Sigurd_.

16. The corslet is ript open, the maid begins to speak. When
awakened from her sleep, on what will she chiefly with Sigurd converse
hold, which to the prince's benefit may tend?

_Gripir_.

17. She to thee, powerful one! runes will teach, all those which
men ought to know; and in every man's tongue to speak, and medicines
for healing. May good await thee, king!

_Sigurd_.

18. Now that is past, the knowledge is acquired, and I am ready
thence away to ride. Apply thy mind, and at length say what more will
my life befall.

_Gripir_.

19. Thou wilt find Heimir's dwellings, and the glad guest wilt be of
that great king. Vanished is, Sigurd! that which I foresaw; no further
mayest thou Gripir question.

_Sigurd_.

20. Now bring me grief the words thou speakest; for thou foreseest,
king! much further; thou knowest of too great calamity to Sigurd;
therefore thou, Gripir! wilt not utter it.

_Gripir_.

21. Of thy life the early portion lay before me clearest to
contemplate. I am not truly accounted sage, nor of the future
prescient: that which I knew is gone.

_Sigurd_.

22. No man I know on the earth's surface, who greater prescience has
than thou, Gripir! Thou mayest not conceal it, unhappy though it be,
or if ill betide my life.

_Gripir_.

23. Not with vices will thy life be sullied; let that, noble
prince! in thy mind be borne; for while mankind exists, thy name,
director of the spear-storm! will be supreme.

_Sigurd_.

24. The worst seems to me, that Sigurd is compelled from the king to
