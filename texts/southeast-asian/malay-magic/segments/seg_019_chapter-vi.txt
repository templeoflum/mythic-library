1.BIRTH-SPIRITS
Wenowcome tothe spirits which arebelieved to
attack bothwomen andchildren atchildbirth.
These arefour innumber :theBajang, which
generally takes theform ofapole-cat(musang)and
disturbs thehousehold bymewing likeagreat cat;
theLangsuir, which takes theform ofanowlwith
long claws, which sitsandhoots upon theroof-tree;
thePontianak orMati-anak, which, aswillbeseen
presently, isalso anight-owl, and issupposed tobe
achild oftheLangsuir, andthePenanggalan, which
isbelieved toresemble atrunkless human head with
thesacofthestomach attached to it,andwhich flies
about seeking foranopportunity ofsucking theblood
ofinfants.
With theabove areoften associated thePolong,
which isdescribed asadiminutive but malicious
species ofbottle -imp, and the Pelesit, which isthe
name given toakind ofgrasshopper (orcricket ?),
butthese latter, though often associated with the
regular birth-spirits, partake also ofthecharacter of

property.
Iwillnow take these spirits intheabove order.
The Bajang, as Ihave said, isgenerally described
astaking theform ofapole-cat(musang),but it
appears tobeoccasionally confused with the Pelesit.
Thus aMalay magician once toldmethattheBajang
took theform ofahouse-cricket, and thatwhen thus
embodied itmaybekeptbyaman, asthePelesit
maybekeptbyawoman. This statement, however,
must notbeaccepted without due reserve, and it
maybetaken asacertainty thattheusual conception
oftheBajang’s embodiment isapole-cat .2
Ineed hardly saythat itisconsidered verydanger-
oustochildren, who aresometimes provided with a
sortofarmlet ofblack silkthreads, called a“bajang
bracelet ”(glang bajang),which, itissupposed, will
protect them against it.Ontheopposite page will

itwasexplained tomebyaMalay,
withwhom Idiscussed thesubject at
leisure, that apart from the spirits
which areanobject ofreverence, and
which when treated withproper defer-
ence areusually beneficent, there are
avariety ofothers. Tobegin with,
spirits (theword usedonthisoccasion
washantu)
areofatleasttwokinds—
wild ones, whose normal habitat isthe
jungle, andthose that are,sotosay,
domesticated. The latter, which seem
tocorrespond towhat inWestern
magic arecalled‘familiars,’ vary in
character with their owners orthe
persons towhom they areattached.
Thus inthisparticular village ofBukit
Senggeh, afewyears ago, therewasa
good dealofalarm onaccount ofthe
arrival oftwoorthree strangers believed
tobeofbad character, whowere sup-
posed tokeep afamiliar spirit ofapeculiarly malignant disposition, which
was inthehabit ofattacking people in
their sleep bythrottling them. One
ortwocases ofthiskind occurred, and
itwasseriously suggested that Ishould
make thematter thesubject ofama-
gisterial inquiry, which, however, Idid
notfind itnecessary todo.Butthe
familiar spirits arebynomeans neces-
sarily evil The chief point of
importance istokeep these wild spirits
intheir proper place, viz.thejungle,
and toprevent them taking uptheir
abode inthevillages. For thisreason
charms arehungupattheborders of
thevillages, andwhenever awild spirit
breaks bounds andencroaches onhuman
habitations itisnecessary togethim
turned out.”—Blagden inJ.R.A.S.,

beseen aremarkable drawing1(ofwhich afacsimile
ishere given), which appears torepresent theoutline
ofaBajang, “scripturally”modified toserve asa
counter-charm against theBajang itself .2
The following account oftheBajang isbySir
Frank Swettenham:—
“Some one inthevillage falls illofacomplaint
thesymptoms ofwhich areunusual;theremaybe
convulsions, unconsciousness, ordelirium, possibly for
some days together orwith intervals between the
attacks. The relatives will call inanative doctor,
and ather(she isusually anancient female) sug-
gestion, orwithout it,animpression will arise that
thepatient isthevictim ofabajang. Such anim-
pression quickly develops into certainty, andany
trifle willsuggest theowner ofthe evil spirit. One
method ofverifying thissuspicion istowait tillthe
patient isinastate ofdelirium, andthen toquestion
him orherastowho istheauthor ofthetrouble.
This should bedonebysome independent person of
authority, who issupposed tobeable toascertain
thetruth.
1This‘‘Bajang ”was copied for
meby’CheSam (formany years
Malay munshi and clerk atKuala
Lumpur, Selangor), from theoriginal
which wasposted uponthedoor of
oneofhisneighbours. The outlines
ofthefigure aremade upfrom varying
combinations ofthenames “Allah,”
“Muhammad,”“‘Ali,” etc., inthe
Arabic character.
2“Inallparts ofthePeninsula
theBajang issaid tobeofthe
male gender,while theLangsuir is
supposed tobeafemale. Itisusually
believed byMalays thattheBajang is
merely amalignant spirit which haunts
mankind, andwhose presence foretells
disaster. InPerak andsome otherparts ofthePeninsula, however, the
Bajang isregarded asone ofthe
several kinds ofdemons which, the
Malays hold, canbeenslaved byman
andbecome hisfamiliar spirit. Such
familiars, itisbelieved, arehanded
down incertain families asheirlooms.
Themaster ofthefamiliar issaid to

which isclosed byastopper made
from theleaves oftheCotyledon lacini-
ata,theDaun chekar bebek, orDaun

bytheMalays. Both thecaseand

magic artsbefore theycanbeemployed
inthisway. The familiar isfedwith


VI DETECTION OFSORCERY 323
“Afurther andconvincing proof isthen tocall
ina‘Pawang' skilled indealing with wizards (in
Malay countries they areusually men), and ifhe
knows hisbusiness hispower issuch thathewill
place thesorcerer inoneroom, and, while hein
another scrapes aniron vessel with arazor, the
culprits hair will fall offasthough therazor had
been applied tohishead instead oftothevessel!
That issupposing heistheculprit;ifnot,ofcourse
hewillpassthrough theordeal without damage.
“Ihave been assured that theshaving process is
soefficacious that, asthevessel represents thehead
oftheperson standing his trial,wherever itisscraped
thewizard’s hair will falloffinacorresponding spot.
Itmight besupposed thatunder these circumstances
theaccused isreasonably safe, but this testofguilt
isnotalways employed. What more commonly
happens isthatwhen several cases ofunexplained
sickness have occurred inavillage, with possibly one
ortwodeaths, thepeople oftheplace lodge aformal
complaint against thesupposed author ofthese ills,
anddesire thathebepunished.
“Before theadvent ofBritish influence itwasthe
practice tokillthewizard orwitch whose guilthad
been established toMalay satisfaction, andsuch execu-
tionswere carried outnotmany years ago.
“Iremember acase inPerak lessthan tenyears
ago,when thepeople ofanup-river village accused
aman ofkeeping abajang,andthepresent Sultan,
eggs and milk. When itsmaster which canonly becured bymagic
wishes tomake useofithesends it agencies. IftheBajang isneglected

whowasthen theprincipal Malay judge intheState,
toldthem hewould severely punish thebajang ifthey
would produce it.They wentaway hardly satisfied,
andshortly aftermade aunited representation tothe
effect that iftheperson suspected were allowed to
remain intheir midst theywould killhim. Before
anything could bedone theyputhim, hisfamily, and
effects onaraftand started themdown the river.
Ontheir arrival atKuala Kangsar themanwasgiven
anisolated huttolive in,butnotlong afterwards he
disappeared.
“The hereditary bajang comes likeother evils,
theunsought heritage ofadissolute ancestry, butthe
acquired bajang isusually obtained from thenewly-
buried body ofastillborn child, which issupposed
tobetheabiding-place ofafamiliar spirit until lured
therefrom bythesolicitations ofsome onewho, at
dead ofnight, stands over thegrave andbypotent
incantations persuades thebajang tocome forth.”1
“It isallvery well fortheKedah ladies tosacrifice
theirshadows toobtain possession ofapelsit, leaders
ofsociety must beinthefashion atany cost;but
there areplenty ofpeople living inPerak whohave
seenmore than oneancient Malay dame taken out
into the river and, despite her protestations, her
tears, and entreaties, have watched her,withhands
and feet tied, putinto thewater andslowly pushed
down outofsight bymeans ofalong pole with a
fork atoneendwhich fitted onherneck. Those
whohave witnessed these executions have nodoubt
ofthejustice ofthepunishment, andnotuncommonly
add that aftertwoorthree examples hadbeenmade
there would always ensue aperiod ofrestfrom the

torments ofthebajang. Ihave alsobeen assured
that thebajang,intheshape ofalizard, hasbeen
seen toissuefrom thedrowning person’s nose. That
statement nodoubt ismade ontheauthority ofthose
whocondemned andexecuted thevictim.”1
The popular superstition about theLangsuir is
thusdescribed bySirWilliam Maxwell:—
“Ifawoman dies inchildbirth, either before
delivery orafter thebirth ofachild, andbefore the
forty days ofuncleanness have expired, she ispopu-
larly supposed tobecome alangsuyar,aflying
demon ofthenature ofthe‘white lady’ or‘banshee.’
Toprevent thisaquantity ofglass beads areput in
themouth ofthecorpse, ahen’s egg isputunder
each arm-pit, andneedles areplaced inthepalms of
thehands. Itisbelieved that ifthis isdone the
deadwoman cannot become alangsuyar,asshe
cannot open hermouth toshriek(ngilai)orwave
herarms aswings, oropen andshut herhands to
assist herflight.”2
The superstitions about theLangsuir, however,
donotend here, forwith regard toitsorigin the
Selangor Malays tellthefollowing story:—
The original Langsuir (whose embodiment is
supposed tobeakind ofnight-owl) isdescribed as
being awoman ofdazzling beauty, whodiedfrom the
shock ofhearing thatherchild was stillborn, andhad
taken theshape ofthePontianak .3Onhearing this

terrible news, she “clapped herhands,” andwithout
further warning “flew whinnying away toatree,
upon which sheperched.” Shemay beknown by
herrobe ofgreen, byhertapering nails ofextraordinary
length (amark ofbeauty), andbythelong jetblack
tresses which sheallows tofalldown toherankles—
only, alas
!(forthetruth must betold) inorder to
conceal thehole intheback ofherneckthrough which
shesucks theblood ofchildren !These vampire-like
proclivities ofhersmay, however, besuccessfully com-
bated iftherightmeans areadopted, for ifyouare
able tocatch her, cutshort her nails andluxuriant
tresses, andstuffthem intothehole inherneck, she
willbecome tame andindistinguishable from anordi-
narywoman, remaining soforyears. Cases havebeen
known, indeed, inwhich shehasbecome awifeand
amother, until shewasallowed todance atavillage
merry-making, when she atonce reverted toher
ghostly form, andflew offinto thedarkandgloomy
forest fromwhence shecame.
Intheir wild state, aMalay once informed me,
these woman-vampires areexceedingly fond offish,
andonce andagainmaybeseen “sitting incrowds
onthe fishing -stakes atthe river mouth awaiting
anopportunity tosteal thefish.” However thatmay
be, itseems curiously inkeeping with thefollowing
charm for“laying”aLangsuir:—
“Oyemosquito-fry attheriver’s mouth
When yetagreatway off,yearesharp ofeye,
When near, yearehard ofheart.
When therock intheground opens ofitself
Then (andthen only) beemboldened thehearts ofmyfoesand
opponents !
When thecorpse intheground opens ofitself
Then (andthen only) beemboldened thehearts ofmyfoesand

The “mosquito-fry attherivers mouth”inthe first

suirwhofrequent thefishing-stakes.
ThePontianak (orMati-anak), ashasalready been
said, isthestillborn child oftheLangsuir, and its
embodiment islikethatofitsmother, akind ofnight-
owl .1Curiously enough, itappears tobetheonlyone
ofthese spirits which rises tothedignity ofbeing
addressed asa“Jin”or“Genie,” asappears from the
charms which areused forlaying it.Thuswefind in
acommon charm:—
“OPontianak theStillborn,
Mayyoubestruck deadbythesoilfrom thegrave-mound.
Thus (we) cutthebamboo-joints, thelongandtheshort,
Tocook therein theliver oftheJin(Demon) Pontianak.

aneedle inthepalm ofeachhand, and(probably) glass
beads orsome simple equivalent initsmouth. The
charm which isusedonthisoccasion willbefound in

ThePenanggalan isasort ofmonstrous vampire
which delights insucking theblood ofchildren. The
story goes thatonceupon atime awoman was sitting,

pectedly amancame in,andfinding hersitting inthe
vat,asked her, “What areyoudoing there ?”To
thisthewoman replied, “What business haveyouto
ask ?”butbeing verymuch startled sheattempted to
escape, and intheexcitement ofthemoment, kicked
herownchinwithsuch force that theskin splitround
herneck, andherhead (with thesacofthestomach
depending from it)actually became separated from the
trunk, andflew offtoperch upon thenearest tree.
Ever since then shehasexisted asaspirit ofevil,
sitting ontheroof-tree whinnying(mengilai)whenever
achild isborn inthehouse, ortrying toforce herway
upthrough theflooronwhich thechild lies, inorder
todrink itsblood .1
The onlytwo spirits ofthis class which now re-
main arethePolong and the Pelesit, and these,
asIhave said,partake toagreat extent ofthecharac-

sure todie. Iftheblood andwater
which dripped from the intestines

immediately followed and hisbody

means confined toasingle “role”asthepreceding
oneshave been.
The Polong resembles anexceedingly diminu-
tivefemale figure ormannikin, being inpoint ofsize
about asbigasthetopjoint ofthe little finger. It
will flythrough the airtowherever itistold to
go,but isalways preceded by itspetorplaything
(pemainan),the Pelesit, which, ashasalready been
said,appears tobeaspecies ofhouse-cricket. When-
ever thePolong wishes toenter(di-rasoki)anew
victim, itsends thePelesit onbefore it,andassoon as
thelatter, “flying inaheadlong fashion (menelentang
menjerongkong ),”hasentered itsvictim’s body, which
itusually does /#f/-foremost, andbegins tochirp, the
Polong follows. Itisgenerally hidden away outside
thehouse by itsowner(Jinjangan :),and fedwith
blood pricked from thefinger. Thedescription usually
given ofaPolong tallies curiously with theMalay
definition ofthesoul .1
The lastofthese spirits, the Pelesit (orhouse-
forthepenanggalan has, itseems, a
dread ofthorns inwhich herintestines
mayhappen togetcaught. Itissaid
that apenanggalan once came toa
man’s house inthemiddle ofthenight
tosuck hisblood, andher intestines
were caught insome thorns near the
hedge, andshehad toremain there
until daylight, when thepeople saw
andkilled her.

ofthis istosoak theintestines in,for
when they issue forth from thebody
theyimmediately swell upandcannot

galan flying along with itsentrails dan-

parched orsaffron-stained rice, oronblood drawn
from the tipofthefourth finger which they prick for

1Nolessthanseven “Bidans,” itis
said,were formerly requisitioned atthe
birth ofaRaja’s child, andoccasions
when even nine arementioned areto
bemetwith inMalay romances. The
most general custom, however, seems
tohavebeen tosummon seven“Bidans”
only, thenumber being possibly due
totheMalay theory ofasevenfold
soul (v.Soul). The profession wasan
honourable one,andtheBidans received
the title of“Dato’ (abbreviated to
’Toh) Bidan ”;but ifthechild ofaRaja

insmall brass receptacles, butonsuch occasions asthe
present noreceptacles areused, theusual accessories
ofthebetel-chewing ceremony being deposited in
thecherana itself. The Bidan, onreceiving the
cherana,andcharming thecontents, inverts it,pour-
ingout(di-chorahkan)itscontents upon thefloor, and
taking omens forthecoming event from themanner
inwhich they fall .1Shethencommences tochew the
betel-leaf, andwhen shehastaken asmuch asshe
requires, she generally performs some species of
divination(tengo dalam petua)inorder toascertain
thenature ofthechild’s horoscope. This object may
beachieved inseveral ways;eg.byastrological
calculations;bycasting up{palak orfalakiah)the
numerical values oftheletters ofboth parents’ names,

thespot selected,1while justexactly beneath itunder
thefloor ofthehouse (which israised onpiles like
theoldSwiss lake-dwellings) arefastened abunch of
leaves oftheprickly pandanus, the“acid”egg-plant,2
andalekar jantan, which isakind ofrattan stand
used forMalay cooking-pots. The leaves ofthese
plants areusedbecause itisthought that their thorns
willprickanyevil spirit3which tries togetatthechild
from below, whilst thecircular cooking-pot stand will

justunder the rafters, isspread acasting-net(jala),
together with abunch ofleaves ofthereddracaena

Abigtray(talam)isnow filled with ameasure of
uncooked husked rice(b'ras sa-gontang),andcovered

VI PURIFICATION AFTER BIRTH335
leaves oflengkuas, halict, kunyit frits,kunyit
,pandan
bau,areca-palm blossom, andthedried leaves(keron-
song orkeresek)ofthepisang k'lat. This hastobe
repeated (every?)morning andevening. Inmost
places thenew-born infant is,ashasbeen said, laid
upon amatandformally adopted bythefather, who
breathes intothechild’s ear1asortofMuhammadan
prayer orformula, which iscalled bang inthecase
ofaboy,andkamat inthecase ofagirl. After
purification thechild isswaddled inasortofpapoose;
aninner bandage(barut)isswathed round thechild’s
waist, andabroad clothband (kain lampin) iswound
round itsbodyfrom theknees tothebreast, afterwhich
theouter bandage(kain bedong) iswound round the
child’s body from thefeettotheshoulder, and isworn
continually until thechild isthree orfourmonths old,
or,inMalay parlance, until hehaslearned tocrawl
(tahu meniarap). This contrivance, itisalleged, pre-
vents thechild from starting andstraining itsmuscles.
Over the child’s mat issuspended asort ofsmall
conical mosquito-net (kain bochok),theupper endof
which isgenerally stitched(di-semat)orpinned onto
thetopoftheparent’s mosquito curtain, andwhich is
intended toprotect thechild from anystray mosquito
orsandfly which mayhave found itsway into the
bigger netusedbyhisparents.
1Vide McNair, Perak and the
Malays, p.231. “Thechildren ofthe
Malays arereceived intotheworld quite
inreligious form, prayer being said,
and theAzan orAllah Alcbar pro-
nounced bythefather with his lips
close tothetender infant’s ear.” The
bang,according to’Che Sam, a
Malay pandit ofKuala Lumpor, ran
somewhat asfollows:—
Allahu Akbar

Rasul Allah (twice), hei‘Ali al-saleh

Nextcomes theceremony ofmarking theforehead
(ckonting muka),which issupposed tokeep thechild
from starting and straining itself(>jangan terkejut ter-
kekau), andfrom convulsions
(sawan),andatthesame
time topreserve itfrom evil spirits. The following
arethedirections:—Take chips ofwood from thethin
end(kapala ?)ofthethreshold, from thesteps ofthe
house-ladder, andfrom thehouse furniture, together
with acoat(kesip)ofgarlic, acoatofanonion, assa-
fcetida, arattan cooking-pot stand, and fibrefrom the
“monkey-face”ofanunfertile cocoa-nut(tampo niyor
jantan). Burn allthese articles together, collect the
ashes, andmixthem bymeans ofthefore-finger with
alittle “betel- water.”
Now repeat theproper charm,1dipthefinger in
themixture, andmark thecentre ofthechild’s fore-
head, ifaboywith asignresembling what iscalled a
bench mark v,ifagirlwithaplain cross -f,andatthe
same time putsmall daubs onthenose, cheeks, chin,
andshoulders. Then mark themother with aline
drawn from breast tobreast(pangkah susu) and a
daubontheendofthenose(cholek hidong). Ifyou
dothisproperly, aLangat Malay informed me,the
EvilOne willtakemother andchild forhisown wife
andchild(who aresupposed tobesimilarly marked)
and willconsequently refrain fromharming them!
Inaddition totheabove, ifthechild isagirl,her
eyebrows areshaved andacurve drawn intheir place,
extending from theroot ofthenose totheear (di-
pantiskan bentoktajiderimuka sampei pelipis ).The
mixture used formarking these curves consists of
manjakani mixed withmilkfrom themother’s breast.
Another most curious custom which recalls aparallel

VI COMPRESSING THEHEAD 337
custom among North American Indians, isocca-
sionally resorted toforthepurpose ofaltering the
shape ofthechild’s head. When itisconsidered too
long (terlampau panjang), asmall tightly-fitting “yam
leafcap” (songko daun fcladi), consisting ofseven
thicknesses ofcalladium (yam) leaves isused tocom-
press it.This operation issupposed toshorten the
child’s skull, andtheperson who fits itontothechild’s
head uses thewords—“Muhammad, short beyour
head” inthecase ofaboy,and “Fatimah, short be
yourhead”inthecaseofagirl.
Nowcomes theceremony ofadministering tothe
infant what iscalled the“mouth-opener” (lit.“mouth-
splitter,” pemd lahmulut);first, you take agreen
cocoa-nut (niyor sungkoran),split itinhalves (di-bVa/i
niyor),puta“grain”ofsaltinside one-half oftheshell
(di-buboh garam sa-buku),andgive ittothechild to
drink, counting uptoseven, and putting ittothe
child’s mouth attheword seven (letakkan dimulut-
nya). Then repeat theceremony, substituting asam
(tamarinds?) forthe salt. Finally, take agold ring,
andafterrubbing itagainst theinside ofthecocoa-nut
(cholek di-dalam niyor), lay itupon thechild’s lips,
(letakkan dibibir-nya),saying“Bismillah,” etc.Do
thesame with asilver andamalgam (gold and silver)
ring respectively, andtheceremony willbeatanend.
Imay note, inpassing, that itisinallusion tothe
above ceremony thatyou willsometimes hear oldmen
say“It’snotthe firsttime Itasted salt, Ididsoever
since Iwas firstputintomyswinging-cot ”(akumakan
garam dahulu, deripada tatkala naik buayan).
Sometimes alittle“rock” sugar(gula batu)isadded
tomake the“mouth-opener”more palatable.

which continues until itisweaned bytheapplication

Intherice-jar (buyong Uras)during this period, a

Once inevery four hours the child should be
bathed with cold water, inorder that itmaybekept
“cool.” This custom, Iwas told, isdiametrically
opposite tothatwhich obtains atMalacca, where the
child isbathed asrarely aspossible. Thecustom
followed inSelangor issaid toprevent thechild from
getting asoremouth(.guam).
Forthe firsttwomonths orso,whenever thechild
isbathed, itisrubbed over with apaste obtained by
mixing powdered ricewith thepowder obtained from
aredstone called batu kawi. This stone, which is
saidbysome Malays totake itsname from theIsland
ofLangkawi, isthought topossess astringent (k'lat)
qualities, and isused byMalay women toimprove
their skin. Before usethepaste isfumigated with the
smoke ofburning eagle- wood, sandal-wood, andincense,
after which the liquid, which issaid toresemble
red ink, isapplied totheskin, andthenwashed off,
nodoubt, with lime-juice intheordinary way.
Inthecoldwater which isused forbathing the
child aredeposited abigiron nail (asa“symbol of
iron ”),“candle-nuts”andcockle-shells(kulit k'rang),
towhich some Malays addakind ofparasite called
sibernas (i.e.Well- Filled Out, aword applied to
children whoare fat,instead ofthewordgemok,which
isconsidered unlucky) andanother parasite called
sadingin orsidingin,the“Cold”one.
After bathing, theBidan should perform the
ceremony called sembor sirih,which consists inthe


VI NAMING THECHILD 34i
ejecting ofbetel-leaf (mixed with other ingredients)
outofhermouth ontothepitofthechild’s stomach,
theingredients being pounded leaves ofthebunglei,
chekor,andjerangau,andchips ofbrazil-wood, ebony,
andsugar -palm twigs(segar kabong);tothese are
sometimes added small portions ofthe“Rough”
bamboo(buluh kasap\ ofthebemban balu, andof
the leaf-cases oftheareca-palm (either upih b'lah
batang orupih sarong).
The child isgenerally named within the firstweek,
but Ihave notyetheard ofanyspecial ceremony con-
nected with thenaming, though itismost probably
considered asareligious act.Thename isevidently
considered ofsome importance, for ifthechildhappens
toget illdirectly after thenaming, itissometimes
re-adopted (temporarily) byathird party, whogives it
adifferent name. When thishappens aspecies of
bracelets andanklets made ofblack cloth areputupon
thechild’s wrists andankles, theceremony being called
tumpang sayang.
Afewdays laterthechild’s head isshaved, andhis
nails cutforthe first time. Fortheformer process a
redlather ismanufactured from fine rice-flour mixed
withgambier, lime,and betel-leaf. Some people have
thechild’s head shaved clean, others leave thecentral

The floor having been smeared with rice-cosmetic
(bedak)(such astheMalays use forthebathing
ceremony), itiswell scratched bytheclaws ofa
fowl, which iscaught (andwashed) forthepurpose,
andthen held over the floor and forced todothe
scratching required of it.The cosmetic isthen
removed(di-langir)bymeans oflime-juice (again as
inthebathing ceremony) and thehearth -fire is
changed. TheBidan now receives herpay, usually
getting incash fortheeldest child $4.40 (insome
places $5.40), forthesecond, $3.40, the third, $2.40,
andforthefourth, and allsubsequent children, $1.40;
unless she ishastily summoned(bidan tareU) andno
engagement (menempak) hasbeen made, inwhich
caseshemaydemand half abhara ($11). Besides
thissomewhat meagre remuneration, however, she
receives from thewell-to-do (atthe floor-washing
ceremony) such presents ascast -offclothes (kain
bekas tuboh),abowl ofsaffron rice, abowl ofthe
rice-cosmetic andlimes(bedak limau),andaplatter
ofbetel -leaf, with accessories(cherana sirik).
Though theremuneration mayappear small, itwas,
nevertheless, sure;asinformer days anunwritten
lawallowed her totake thechild and“cry itfor
sale” (idi-jaja)round thecountry, should her fee
remain unpaid.
Before concluding thepresent subject itwillbe
necessary todescribe certain specific injunctions and
taboos which form animportant part ofthevast
body ofMalay customs which centre specially round
thebirth ofchildren.
Before thechild isborn thefather hastobemore
than usually circumspect withregard towhat hedoes,
asanyuntoward actonhispartwould assuredly have


VI INFRINGEMENT OFTABOOS 349
aprejudicial effect onthe child, andcause abirth-
mark oreven actual deformity, anysuch affection
being called kenan. Inacasewhich came tomy
notice thesonwasborn withonly athumb, forefinger,
and little finger onthe lefthand, andagreat toeon
the left foot, therestofthefingers andtoesonthe
leftsidebeing wanting. This, Iwas told,wasdueto
thefactthatthefather violated thistaboo bygoing to
thefishing-stakes onedayand killing acrabbychop-
ping atitwith acutlass.
Informer days during thisperiod itwas“taboo”
(pantang) forthefather tocutthethroat ofabuffalo
oreven ofafowl;or,infact, totake the lifeofany
animal whatever—atrace nodoubt ofIndian influ-
ences.AMalay toldmeonce that hisson,soon
after birth, was afflicted with agreat obstruction of
breathing, butthatwhen themedicine-man (Pawang)
declared (after “diagnosing”thecase) that thechild
was suffering from a“fish-affection ”(kenan ikan), he
remembered thathehadknocked onthehead an
extraordinary number offishwhich hehadcaught
ontheveryday that hissonwas born. Hethere-
fore,bytheadvice ofthemedicine -man, gave the
child apotion made frompounded fishbones, andan
immediate andpermanent recovery wastheresult.
Such affections asthose described are classified
bytheMalays according tothekind ofinfluence
which issupposed tohave produced them. Thus
theunoffending victim may beeither fish -struck
(kenan ikan), asdescribed above, ape-struck (kenan
b'rok), dog-struck (kenan anjing),crab-struck (kenan
ketam),and soforth, itbeing maintained that in
every case thechild either displays some physical
deformity, causing aresemblance totheanimal by


350 BIRTH CEREMONIES CHAP.
which itwas affected, orelse(andmore commonly)
unconsciously imitates itsactions orits“voice.”
Another interesting custom was that the father
was stringently forbidden tocuthishair until after
thebirth ofthechild.
The following passage bearing onthesubject is
taken from SirW.E.Maxwell’s article onthe“Folk-
loreoftheMalays”
:1—
“Inselecting timber fortheuprights ofaMalay
house caremust betaken toreject anylogwhich
isindented bythepressure ofany parasitic creeper
which mayhavewound round itwhen itwasaliving
tree.Alogsomarked, ifused inbuilding ahouse,
willexercise anunfavourable influence inchildbirth,
protracting delivery and endangering the lives of

VI PRECAUTIONS AGAINST DEMONS 351
great extent toSelangor, butwithafewdiscrepancies.
Thus ahouse-post indented byacreeper isgenerally
avoided inSelangor foradifferent reason, viz.that it
issupposed tobring snakes intothehouse.
“Dividing thehouse,” however, isgenerally con-
sidered animportant birth -taboo inSelangor, the
threatened penalty for itsnon -observance being
averted bycompelling theguilty party tosubmit tothe
unpleasant ceremony called sembor ayer,amember
ofthefamily being required toeject(sembor)amouth-
fulofwater upon thesmall oftheculprit’s back.
InSelangor, again, aguest must staythree nights
(not two) inthehouse, hisdeparture onthe first or
second night being called “Insulting theNight”
(menjolok malawi). Toavert theevilconsequences of
such anact,fumigation(jvabun-rabun)
isresorted to,
the“recipe” for itrunning asfollows:—“Take assa-
fcetida, sulphur, kunyit t'rus (an evil-smelling root),
onion skins, dried areca-nut husk, lemon-grass leaves,
andanoldmat orcloth, burn them, andleave the
ashes forabout anhour atsunset onthefloor ofthe
passage infront ofthedoor.” That asensible and
self-respecting“demon”should avoid ahouse where
such anunconscionable odour israised isnotinthe
least surprising !
Intheevent ofaneclipse thecustoms ofthetwo
sister States appear tobenearly identical;theonly
difference being that inSelangor thewoman isplaced
inthedoorway (inthemoonlight asfaraspossible),
and isfurnished with thebasket-work stand ofacook-
ingpot,aswellasawooden rice-spoon, theformer asa
trap tocatch anyunwary demon whomaybesofoolish

rattan binding ofthespoon (which must, ofcourse, be
oftheorthodox Malay pattern) willunwind itselfand
entangle theassailant”inthecaseofanyrealdanger.
Finally, theBidan must bepresent to“massage”the
woman, andrepeat thenecessary charms.
From thefollowing passage itwould appear that
thecorresponding Pahang custom does notmaterially
differ from thatofPerak andSelangor:—
“Butduring theperiod thattheMoon’s fatehung
inthebalance, Selema hassuffered many things. She
hasbeen seated motionless inthefireplace under the
tray-like shelf, which hangs from thelow rafters,
trembling with terror of—sheknows notwhat. The
little basket-work stand, onwhich thehotrice-pot is
wont torest, iswornonherhead asacap,and inher
girdle thelongwooden rice-spoon isstuck dagger-wise.
Neither shenorUmat know why these things are
done, buttheynever dream ofquestioning their neces-
sity. Itisthecustom. Themen ofolden dayshave
decreed thatwomen with child should dothese things
when theMoon isintrouble, andtheconsequences of
neglect aretooterrible toberisked;soSelema and
Umat actaccording totheir simple faith.”1

VI CEREMONIAL HAIR-CUTTING 353
Thefollowing isadescription oftheriteoftonsure
(berchukor), atwhich Iwaspresent inperson:—
“Some timeago (in1897)Ireceived, through one
ofmylocalMalay headmen, aninvitation toattend a
tonsure ceremony.
“When Iarrived (about two p.m.), incompany of
theheadman referred to,theusual dancing andKoran-
chanting wasproceeding intheouter chamber or
verandah, which wasdecked outfortheoccasion with
theusual brilliantly coloured ceiling-cloth andstriped
wall-tapestry. After ashort interval wewere invited
toenter aninner room, where anumber ofMalays of
bothsexes were awaiting theperformance ofthe rite.
The first thing, however, thatcaught theeyewasa
gracefully-draped figure standing withshrouded head,
andwith itsback tothecompany, upon thelowest
stepofthedais(grei),which hadbeen erected with
aview totheprospective wedding ceremony. This
was the bride.Adark-coloured veil,thrown over
herhead and shoulders, allowed seven luxuriant
tresses ofherwonderful raven -black hair toescape
and rolldown below herwaist, aringofprecious metal
being attached totheend ofeach tress. Close to
thebride, andready tosupport her,should sherequire
it,inhermotherly arms, stood the(onsuch occasions)
familiar figure oftheDuenna (Mak Inang\ whose
duty, however, inthepresent instance wasconfined
totaking the lefthand ofthebride between herown,
andsupporting itinahorizontal position whilst each
oftheseven Representatives [orang waris)1
inturn
was sprinkling itwith the‘Neutralising Rice-
paste’[tepong tawar) bymeans oftheusual bunch
1Lit.“heirs”(warith),butoften, ashere, used inthesense ofrepre-
sentative members ofthefamily.

orbrush ofleaves. Alittle infront ofthis pair
stood ayouth supporting inhishands anunhusked
cocoa-nut shell. Thecrown ofthiscocoa-nut had
been removed, andtheedges atthetopcutinsuch
away astoform achevroned or‘dog-tooth’border.
Upon theindentations ofthisrimwasdeposited a
necklace, andalarge pair ofscissors about thesize
ofatailor’s shears were stuck point downwards in
therim.The cocoa-nut itselfwasperhaps half-filled
with its‘milk.’ Close tothisyouth stood another,
supporting one oftheusual circular brass trays
(with high sides) containing alltheordinary acces-
sories ofthetepong tawar ceremony, i.e.abowl of
rice-paste, abrush ofleaves, parched rice,washed
saffron-stained rice,andbenzoin orincense.
“Iwasnow requested toopen theproceedings,
butatmyexpress desire thePenghulu (Malay head-
man) didsoforme, first scattering several handfuls
(ofthedifferent sorts ofrice) over the bride, and
then sprinkling therice-paste upon thepalm ofher
lefthand, which washeldouttoreceive itasdescribed
above. The sprinkling over, hetook thescissors and
with great deliberation severed theendofthe first
lock,which wasmade tofallwith alittle splash, and
with thering attached to it,into thecocoa-nut with
the‘dog-tooth’border.
“Five other waris (Representatives) andmyself
followed suit,theseven tresses with therings attached
tothem being allreceived inthecocoa-nut asdescribed.
“Achild oftheageofabout twoorthree years
underwent thetonsure atthesame time, each ofthe
Representatives, after severing thebride’s lock, snip-
ping offaportion ofthechild’s hair. The childwas
inarmsandwasnotveiled, butwore ashoulder-cloth

(bidak)thrown over hisshoulder. Attheconclusion
oftheceremony we lefttheroom, andtheKoran-
chanting wasresumed andcontinued until thearrival
ofthebridegroom inprocession (atabout five p.m.),
when thebride andbridegroom went through the
ceremony ofbeing‘seated sidebyside’
(bersanding),
andthebusiness ofthedaywasconcluded.
“The cocoa-nut containing thesevered tresses and
rings iscarried tothefoot ofabarren fruit-tree (e.g.
apomegranate-tree), when therings areextracted and
thewater (with thesevered locks) poured outatthe
tree’s foot, thebelief being that thisproceeding will
make thetree asluxuriant asthehairoftheperson
shorn,avery clear example of‘sympathetic magic.’
Iftheparents arepoor, thecocoa-nut isgenerally
turned upside down and leftthere;but ifthey are
well-to-do, thelocks areusually sent toMecca in
charge ofapilgrim, who casts them onhisarrival
intothewellZemzem.”
Iwillnow describe theceremony offiling or
“sharpening” theteeth, from notes taken bymyself
during theactual ceremony (20th March, 1897).
The youth whose teeth Isaw filedmust have
been quite fifteen orsixteen years ofage,andhad
notlong before undergone the riteofcircumcision.
When Iarrived Ifound thehouse newly swept and
clean, and alltheaccessories oftheceremony already
prepared. These latter consisted ofaround tray
(dulang)containing theusual bowl ofrice -paste
(tepong tawar\ with thebrush ofleaves,1three cups
(containing different sorts ofrice), anegg,2three rings

sisted ofleaves ofthesap^noh,pttlut- ribu (akind ofcreeper).
pulut,sapanggil,sambau dara,and2Into thisegg, itissupposed, all


356 ADOLESCENCE CHAP.
ofprecious metals (gold, silver, andamalgam), a
couple oflimes, andtwosmall files (towhich asmall
tooth-saw andtwosmall whetstones should beadded).1
Theceremony nowcommences :thetooth -filer
(Pawang gigi) first scatters thethree sorts ofriceand
sprinkles thetepong tawar upon hisinstruments,
etc.,repeating theproper charm2atthesame time;
thepatient meanwhile, andthroughout theoperation,
reclining upon hisback onthe floor with hishead
resting onapillow. Next thePawang, sitting
beside thepatient, “touches” thepatient’s teeth, first
with each ofthethree rings ofprecious metal and
then with theegg, throwing each ofthese objects
away ashedoes so,andrepeating each time acharm
(Hu, kata Allah,d. s.b.)}which isgiven inthe
Appendix. Next heprops open (di -sengkang) the
patient’s mouth bymeans ofadried areca-nut,
andrepeats another charm(.Hei,Bismi)inorder to
destroy the “venom”ofthe steel, laying the file
upon the teeth,3and drawing itthrice across
them attheend ofthecharm. Hethen cuts
off(di-Brat)thecrowns ofthe teeth (with one
evil influences proceeding from the
teeth enter. Hence itisregarded after
theceremony assial (unlucky), and
cannot beeaten—indeed itisconsidered
“bad”(temb’lang ).
1Besides thetray containing the
articles described, there stood atone
side oftheroom what iscalled a
dulang-dulang. This consists ofa
tray fullofunhusked ricesurmounted by
atray fullofhusked riceandaroughly-
husked cocoa-nut (niyor gubalan) which
restsupon thelatter. Thepointed top
ofthecocoa-nut referred toisencircled
byahank of“Java” thread [benang
Jawa),which issaid toavert injury to
thetooth -filer’s eyes whenever, as
sometimes happens, the evilinfluence(badi) issues from the teeth. This
dulang-dulang isvalued ataquarter
ofadollar, and istaken aspart pay-
ment ofthetooth-filer’s services, orit
mayberetained bythehouseholder
when thefullfeeoffiftycents ispaid.
This dulang -dulang isthought,
moreover, todispel evil influences
(membuang sial),thehank ofyarn
being usedbythePawang towipe his
eyes should anyharm tothem accrue
from evil influences residing inthe
teeth. Such evil influences(badi),
however, canonlyaccrue when people
arehaving their teeth filed forthe first
time (orang bungaran).

ofthe files), smooths their edges(di-popar)with
oneofthewhetstones, andpolishes them i^melechek).
During thewhole ofthis part oftheperformance,
which isatrying ordeal towitness, although itis
borne with theutmost fortitude onthepart ofthe
sufferer, thelatter holds asmall mirror infront ofhis
mouth inorder tobeassured that theoperation is
progressing tohis satisfaction. When the actual
filing isover, theareca-nut isextracted, andapiece
ofcocoa-nut husk orsmall block ofpulai wood
inserted initsstead, inorder tofacilitate theproper
polishing ofthenow mutilated teeth. This latter
part oftheoperation isaccomplished bymeans of
the file,asmall piece offolded white cloth protecting
thelipsfrom injury.
Considerable interest attaches tothefiling ofthe
first tooth, onaccount oftheomens which aretaken
from theposition inwhich thecrown happens tolie
when itfalls. If,when thetooth isfiled through, the
crown adheres tothe file, itistaken asasign that
thepatient willdieathome;ifitflies offand lies
with itsedge turned upwards, thismeans, onthecon-
trary, thathewilldieabroad.
Attheconclusion oftheoperation aspecies of
poultice(ubat tasak), consisting mainly ofcooked
ginger(halia bara di-pahis-ki),which isintended to
“deaden (the feeling of)thegums”(niatikan daging
gust) isdulycharmed1andapplied tothegums of
thejawwhich happens tobeunder treatment. The
Pawang now laysonehand (the left)onthetopof
thepatients head andtheother upon theteeth of
theupper jaw,andpresses them together withashow
ofconsiderable force, making believe, as itwere, that

ADOLESCENCE CHAP. 358
heispressing thepatients upper teeth firmly intotheir
sockets. Finally, aportion ofbetel -leaf ischarmed
(with thecharm Hong sarangin, etc.)andgiven to
thepatient tochew, after which, itisasserted, all
pain immediately ceases. ThePawang thenwashes
hishands, resharpens histools, andthose present sit
down toameal ofsaffron-stained pulut rice. This
concludes theceremony fortheday, thelower jaw
being similarly treated upon asubsequent occasion.
Inthecourse ofthree suchoperations (thePawang
informed me)theteeth canbefileddown even with
thegums, inwhich casethey are, Ibelieve, insome
instances somewhat roughly plated orcased with gold.
Sometimes, however, they aremerely filed into points,
sothatthey resemble theteeth ofashark .1Very
frequently, too,they blacken them with amixture of
theempyreumatic oilofthecocoa-nut shell (baja or
grang) andkamunting (Kl. karamunting)wood,2
which isalso used forblackening theeyebrows.
These customs, however, arealready dying out in
themore civilised Malay States.
1“Both sexeshave theextraordinary
custom offiling andotherwise disfigur-
ing their teeth, which arenaturally
very white and beautiful, from the
simplicity oftheir food. For files
theymake useofsmall whetstones,
and thepatients lieontheir backs
during theoperation. Many, particu-
larly thewomen oftheLampong
country, have their teeth rubbed down
quite evenwith thegums;others have
them formed inpoints, andsome file
offnomore than theouter coatand
extremities inorder thattheymay the
better receive andretain thejetty black-
nesswithwhich theyalmost universally
adorn them. Theblack usedonthese
occasions istheempyreumatic oilofthe
cocoa -nut shell. When this isnotapplied thefiling does not,bydestroy-
ingwhatweterm theenamel, diminish
thewhiteness oftheteeth. . . .The
greatmensometimes settheirs ingold
bycasing withaplate ofthatmetal the
under row;and thisornament, con-
trasted with theblack dye, has,by
lamp orcandle light, avery splendid
effect. Itissometimes indented tothe
shape oftheteeth, butmore usually
quite plain. They donotremove it
either toeatorsleep.”—Marsden, Hist,
ofSumatra (ed.1811),pp.52>53*

alsoobtained byburning theleaves of

VI EAR-BORING 359
Whenever Imade inquiries astothereason of
thisstrange custom, Iwasinvariably told that itnot
only beautified butpreserved theteeth from theaction
ofdecay, which theMalays believe tobesetupbythe
presence ofaminute maggot orworm(ulat\ theirmost

The “Batak” Malays (aMid-Sumatran tribe,many
ofwhom have settled inKuala Langat) aresaid to
chiptheteeth oftheir children intothedesired shape
bytheuseofasmall chisel, theoperation causing such
exquisite agony thatthesufferer willnotunfrequently
leap tohisfeetwith ashriek.
Evenwhen the file isused, thework ofanunskilful
performer (who does notknow how todestroy the
“venom”ofhisinstruments) willcause thesufferer’s
face tobecompletely swollen up(bakup)foralong
period subsequent totheoperation. Yetyoung people
ofboth sexes cheerfully submit tothe risk ofthis
discomfort, andtheonlyremark made bytheyouth
whom Isawundergoing itwasthat it“made hismouth
feeluncomfortable ”
(jelejeh rasamulut-nya).
The ear-boring ceremony(bertindek)appears to
have already lostmuch ofitsceremonial character in
Selangor, where Iwastoldthat itisnowusually per-
formed when thechild isquite small, i.e.attheearliest,
when thechild issome fiveorseven months old,andwhen
itisabout ayear oldatthelatest, whereas inSumatra
(according toMarsden) itisnotperformed until the
child iseight ornine .1Still, however, aspecial kind

called subang,isasmuch theemblem ofvirginity in
thewestern States as iteverwas. The“discarding”
ofthese ear-rings(tanggal subang),which should take
place about seven days after theconclusion ofthe
marriage rites, isceremonial incharacter, and itiseven
thecustom when awidow(janda)ismarried forthe
second time, toprovide herwith apair ofsubang
(which should, however, itissaid, betiedontoher
earsinstead ofbeing inserted intheear-holes, asinthe
caseofagirlwhohasnever been married).
The riteofcircumcision isofcourse common to
Muhammadans allover theworld. Some analogous
practices, however, have alsobeen noticed among the
non-Muhammadan Malayan races oftheEastern
Archipelago, and itisatleast doubtful whether cir-
cumcision asnow practised byMalays isapurely
Muhummadan rite.Among Malays itisperformed
byafunctionary called the“Mudim,”1with aslip
ofbamboo, atanyage (inthe case ofboys)
from about sixorseven uptoabout sixteen years,
thewound being often dressed (atleast intown
districts) with fine claymixed with sootand the
yolk ofeggs, butwhen possible, theclay ismixed
withcocoa-nut fibre(rabok niyor), selumur paku uban,
and theyoung shoots ofthe k'lat plantain(puchok

common purificatory rite called tepong tawar,and
withayer tolak bala (lit.evil-dispelling water). Lights
arekeptburning inthehouse forseveral days (“until
thewound hashealed ”),andtheperformance ofthe
ceremony isalways made theoccasion forabanquet,
together withmusic anddancing ofthekind inwhich
Malays take somuch delight. The cause ofthese
rejoicings isdressed fortheoccasion “like abride-

4.Personal Ceremonies andCharms
Ceremonies andcharms forprotecting orrender-
ingtheperson more attractive orformidable, form
oneofthelargest, butnotperhaps themost inter-
esting orimportant division ofthemedicine-man’s
repertory.
Thefollowing remarkable specimen ofthecharms
belonging tothe first ofthese classes wasgivenme
by’Che ‘Abas ofKlanang inSelangor, aKelantan
Malay:—
“Ifthecorpse inthegrave should speak,
Andaddress people onearth,
May Ibedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,
But ifthecorpse inthegrave donotspeak,
And address people onearth,
May Inotbedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,orbyany
foeorperil, orbyanysonofthehuman race.
And ifthechicken intheeggshould crow,
And calltochickens onearth,
May Ibedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,
But ifthechicken intheeggdonotcrow,”
(etc. etc., asbefore.)
Asageneral rule,however, this particular class of


362 PERSONAL CHARMS CHAP.
charms shows particularly strong traces ofArabic
influence, most often, perhaps, taking theform ofan
injunction (addressed toJinsorAngels) towatch over
theperson ofthepetitioner.
Torightly understand charms ofthesecond class,
which includes Bathing andBetel-charming charms,1we
musthavesome ideaoftheMalay standard ofbeauty.
This, Ineed hardly say, differs widely from that enter-
tained byEuropeans. Inthecase ofmanly beauty
weshould, perhaps, beable toacquiesce tosome
extent intheadmiration which Malays express for
“Brightness ofCountenance’'(chahia),which forms
oneofthechief objects ofpetition inalmost every
oneofthisclass ofcharms;2butnone ofourmodern
Ganymedes would belikely topetition fora“voice
likethevoice oftheProphet David ”;
3ora“coun-
tenance likethecountenance oftheProphet Joseph”
;
still lesswould hebelikely topetition foratongue
“curled likeabreaking wave,” or“amagic serpent,”
orforteeth “like aherd of(black) elephants,” or
forlips“like aprocession ofants.”4
Malay descriptions offemale beauty arenoless
curious. The “brow ”(oftheMalay Helen, forwhose
sake athousand desperate battles arefought inMalay
romances) “isliketheone-day-old moon,”5hereye-
brows resemble “pictured clouds,”6andare“arched

5.BETROTHAL
Betrothal iscalled tunangan orpinangan. When
theparents ofamarriageable youth perceive asuitable
“match” fortheir son,theysend amessenger toher
parents toask ifshehasyetbeen “bespoken ”(kalau
adaorang sebut). Ifthereply issatisfactory, the
messenger isagain despatched tointimate thedesire
oftheyouth’s parents to“bespeak” thehand ofthe
favoured individual forhisson,and toarrange aday
forameeting. These preliminaries areaccompanied
bytheusual polite self-depreciation onboth sides.
Thus, thegirl’s father begins bysaying, “You wish to
bespeak thehand ofmydaughter, whoknows neither
how tocook norhow tosew ”{yang tataku masak,
tcctahu menjait). Butthecustom isnotcarried tosuch
extremes asitisinChina .2

2The youth’s representatives had
further theright tointerview the girl,
andpersonally assure themselves that
shewas“without blemish andwithout
spot.” This interview passed bythe
name ofthe“Inspection oftheBuffalo-
calf,” andwasconducted somewhat as
follows:—When theyouth’s representa-
tives (theWooing Party) gotoinspect
thegirl,oneofthem says—
‘‘Seehow fruitful arethesatela yams,
Where the hills ofBantan risebythe
sea;
Iknow notwhether good luck orcalamity
willfollow it,
Butmyheart turns towards you.”
Here oneofthegirl’s representatives
says,“Look well atthisbuffalo-calf of
mine thathasbeen allowed toforage
foritself. Maybe itscoat istorn, its
limbs broken, oritssight lost.” The
youth’s representative, ifall issatis-
factory, then replies—
“Thesunbeing sohigh,
The buffalo-calf willdieiftethered;
This long while have Ibeen prosecuting
mysearch,
Butnot tillto-day did Imeetwithwhat I
wanted.”

VI CUSTOMS ATBETROTHAL 365
The girl’s parents next callfourorfivewitnesses
(saksi)ofeither sexto“witness” thebetrothal, and
after preparing ameal (nasidan kuek) for their
expected guests, await the arrival oftheyouths
“Representatives,” theyouth himself remaining at
home. One oftheparty carries abetel-leaf tray
furnished with the usual betel-chewing appliances,
together with halfabhara ofdollars ($11) according
tothestricter custom;although (failing thedollars),
aringorbracelet, orother jewellery ofthatvalue,may
besubstituted.
Bearing these presents withthem, theyouth’s re-
presentatives proceed tothehouse ofthegirl’s parents,
where they areinvited toenter andpartake ofthe
betel-leaf provided forthem.Ameal isthen served,
Malay cakes(kueh-kueh)brought forward, and the
company again partake ofbetel.
Thetwoparties now sitdown ina“family circle,”
andoneoftheyouth’s representatives pushes forward
(di-sorongkan) thebetelwhich theyhadbrought with
them, and offers ittothepeople ofthehouse, saying,
“This isapledge ofyour daughter’s betrothal.” The
girl’s father replies, “Be itso, Iaccept it,”orwords to
that effect, andinquires howlong theengagement is
tolast,theanswer being “sixmonths”or“ayear”as
thecasemay be. Both parties then appeal tothe
witnesses to“hear what issaid,” andtheyouth’s rela-
tives return totheirhomes.
Themarriage portion being fixed (inSelangor) by
analmost universal custom attwobharas ofdollars
($44), theamount isnotusually mentioned atthebe-
trothal, itbeing understood that theusual amount is
intended. But ifthegirl’s parents should afterwards
prove reluctant toproceed with thematch, they


366 BETROTHAL CHAP.
forfeit twice theamount ofthe pledge -money
which theyhave received;whereas iftheyouth re-
fuses toproceed hemerely forfeits thepledge-money
($ii)already paid tothegirl’s parents. Some families
payamarriage portion of$30only,andothers (such
asthefamily of’TohKaya Kechil ofKlang) pay
asmuch as$50, butexceptions are rare, $44being
now generally recognised asthecustomary wedding
portion.
However, the girl’s family does notreally receive
anything likethe fullvalue ofthe$44,because ifthe
$44ispaid infulltheproposer hasaright tode-
mand acomplete outfit(persalinan)ofsilk attire, to
thevalue ofabout $20, sothat theamount which
actually changes hands isseldom more than about
$24.
TheMalay fiancde, unlike herEuropean sister, is
attheutmost pains tokeep outofherlover’s way,and
toattain thisobject she issaid tobe“aswatchful asa
tiger.” Noengagement-ring isused inthisneigh-
bourhood, nopriest (orLebai) ispresent atthe
engagement ceremony, nor isthe girlasked forher
consent. Ontheother hand, aregular system ofex-
changing presents, after theengagement, issaid to

time totime innet-work receptacles, andthewoman

ofBritish Malaya, under theword
“Marriage,” wefind:—
‘‘The only terms formarriage in

Both thesewords areused inSelangor,
thefirst(nikah), which properly signifies
themere ceremony or“wedding,”
being more commonly used bythe
better class ofMalays than themore

without allowing aninterval, “Iaccept thismarriage

completed, oneofthebrothers ornear relations ofthe
bridegroom leads him into thebridal chamber, and
seatshim intheusual cross-legged position onthe

hastobend theknees slowly until asitting posture is
reached, andthen return toastanding posture by
slowly straightening theknees, agymnastic exercise
which hastoberepeated thrice, andwhich requires the

handfuls ofricetaken from thenasi setakona;
with
thisthetwofeedeach other simultaneously, each of
them reaching outthehand containing thericetothe

The bridegroom isthen carried offbyhisfriends

This completes thewedding ceremony, butthe
bridegroom isnominally expected toremain under the
roof(and eye)ofhismother-in-law forabout twoyears
(reduced toforty-four days inthecase of“royalty”),
afterwhich hemaybeallowed toremove toahouse

VI STEALING THEBRIDEGROOM 335
Forthree days lustrations arecontinued bythe
newly-married pair,butbefore they arecompleted, and
assoon aspossible after thewedding, friends and
acquaintances oncemore putontheir finery, and
proceed tothehouse topay their respects, tobathe,
andtoreceive largess.
Onthethird dayafter theharilangsong there isa
very curious ceremony calledmandi tolak bala,ormandi
ayersalamat (bathing forgood luck).
Onthenight inquestion therelatives ofthebride-
groom assemble under cover ofthedarkness andmake
abonfire under thehouse ofthenewly-married couple
bycollecting andburning rubbish;intothe firethus
kindled they throw cocoa-nut husks andpepper, or
anything likely tomake itunpleasant forthose within,
andpresently raise such asmoke that thebridegroom
comes hastily down thesteps, ostensibly toseewhat
isthematter, butassoon ashemakes hisappearance,
heisseized byhisrelatives andcarried offbodily to
hisownparents’ house;these proceedings beingknown
asthestealing ofthebridegroom(churi pengantiri).
Next daythere isagrand procession toescort him
back tothehouse ofhisbride, which hereaches about
oneo’clock intheafternoon, theprocessionists carrying
“Rice ofthePresence ”
(nasiadap-adap') withtheeggs
stuck into itasonthe lastdayofthewedding, two
sorts ofholywater inpitchers, called respectively ayer
salamat (water ofgood luck), andayer tolak bala(water
toavert ill-luck), vases offlowers (gumba) containing
blossom-spikes ofthecocoa-nut andareca-nut palms, and
young cocoa-nut leaves rudely plaited intothesemblance
ofspikes ofpalm-blossom, k’risses, etc.etc.,together with
alargenumber ofrudesyringes manufactured from joints
ofbamboo, andcalledpanah ayer,or“water-bows.”

Asetofsimilar objects (including nasiadap-adap\
isprepared bytherelatives ofthebride, anddeposited
upon theground intheplace selected forthebathing
ceremony. Abench being added forthebride and
bridegroom tositupon, theceremony commences with
thecustomary riteoftepong tawar, afterwhich thetwo
kinds ofholy water, ayer tolak balaandayersalamat,
aresuccessively thrown over thepair.
Now, according totheproper custom, during the
proceedings which follow, allthe bride’s relatives
should surround thebride’s seat,andthebridegroom’s
relatives should stand atadistance;but, inorder to
save themselves from awetting, thewomen ofboth
parties now usually assemble round thebride and
bridegroom, where they areprotected byasheet which
ishung between them andthemen;foralltheyoung
mennowproceed todischarge their “water arrows,”
andasthey arestopped bythesheet theyproceed to
turn their syringes against each other, until allare
thoroughly wetted.
Meanwhile ayoung cocoa-nut frond, twisted into
aslip-knot withV-shaped ends (something likethe
“merry thought” ofafowl), ispresented tothebride
andbridegroom, each ofwhom takes hold ofoneend,
andblowing on it(sembor)
thrice, pulls ittill itcomes
undone, andthelepas-lepas rite isconcluded. Finally,
agirdle ofthread ispassed seven times over theheads
andunder thefeetofthebride andbridegroom, when
thebridegroom breaks through thethread andthey
are allfreetoreturn homewards. This latterceremony
iscalled 'lat- lat.The guests then return totheir
homes, divest themselves oftheir wetgarments, and
putontheirwedding attire. The bersnap-snap an,or
feeding ceremony, isthen performed (both vessels

ofadap-adap ricebeing used), andthen allparties
disperse fortheusual games. Seven days after the
“Concluding Day ”(.Hari Langsong),theceremony
ofDiscarding theEarrings (i.e.subang,theemblems
ofvirginity) isperformed bythebride.
RajaBotofSelangor, whoattaches great importance
tothelustration ceremony, andsays that itought not
totake place later than theseventh day (ataRaja’s
wedding), thus describes the fullceremony asonce
arranged byhimself:—Asmall bath-house was built
atthetopofaflight ofseven steps, andwater was
pumped uptoitthrough apipe,whose upper endwas
made fastunder theroof oftheshed, andterminated
inthehead ofadragon(naga),fromwhose jaws
thewater spouted. The steps were completely lined
withwomen, ofwhom there must have been an
immense number (nomenbeing allowed tobepresent),
andtheRaja and hisbride bathed before them.A
royal bath-house ofthiskind iscalled baleipancha
t>ersada,and should beused notonly at“royal”
weddings, butatcoronations(waktu di-naubatkaii);
itisdescribed inthefollowing lines:—
“Naik baleipancha persada
Di-hadap ulehsagala Biduanda,
Dudok semaiam dengan bertakhta.
Mandi ayeryang kalaar dimulutNaga”—
which maybetranslated:—
“Ascend totheRoyal Bath-House
Inthepresence ofallyour courtiers,
Take your seat inroyal state,
Andbathe inthewater that flows from theDragon’s
Mouth.”
Itmust notbesupposed that, with such amass of
detail, many things may nothave been overlooked,


388 MARRIAGE CHAP.
but itmayberemarked assome sortofapractical
conclusion tothisaccount, thattheMalay wedding cere-
mony, even ascarried outbythepoorer classes, shows
that thecontracting parties aretreated asroyalty,
that istosay,assacred human beings, and ifany
further proof isrequired, inaddition totheevidence
whichmaybedrawn from thegeneral character ofthe
ceremony, Imay mention, firstly, the fact that the
bride andbridegroom areactually called Raja Sari,
(i.e.Raja sa-hari,the“sovereigns ofaday ”)
;and,
secondly, that itisapolite fiction thatnocommand
oftheirs, during theironedayofsovereignty, maybe
disobeyed.
Iwillnowgive accounts oftwoMalay weddings
which took place atKlang :both accounts werecom-
posed byrespectable Malays, the firstonebeing trans-
lated byMr.Douglas Campbell ofSelangor, andthe
second bythepresent writer:—

ever, becomplete without some mention ofthecustoms
which regulate, strange as itmay seem, even the
forcible abduction ofawife. Ofthese customs Sir
W.E.Maxwell says:—
“The word panjat inMalay means literally ‘to
climb,’ but itisused inPerak, andperhaps inother
Malay States, tosignify aforcible entry into ahouse
forthepurpose ofsecuring asawifeawoman whom
her relations have already refused tothe intruder.
Thishigh-handed proceeding isrecognised byMalay
custom, and isregulated bycertain well-known rules.
“Panjat isoftwokinds—panjat angkara andpanjat

firstcase, themanmakes hisway intothehouse armed
with his kris, orother weapon, and entering the

upon hisreputation forcourage andstrength, andupon
thenumber ofhisfriends and theinfluence ofhis
family. Awooer who adopts thisviolent method of
compelling theassent ofunwilling relations tohis
marriage tooneoftheir kinmust, saytheMalays,
have three qualifications—
“Ka-rapat-an baniak,
Wang-nia ber-lebih
,
Jantan-nia ber-lebih,
‘Astrong party toback him, plenty ofmoney, andno
lackofbravery.’
“Plenty ofmoney isnecessary, because, byaccepted
custom, iftherelations yield andgive their consent
allthecustomary payments aredoubled;thefine for
thetrespass, which would ordinarily betwenty-five
dollars, becomes fifty dollars;thedower islikewise
doubled, andtheusual present ofclothes (salin) must
consist oftwoofeach ofthethreegarments(salendang,
baju,kain), instead ofone asusual. The fine for
panjat angkara maybeofanyamount, according to
thepleasure ofthewoman’s relations, andthey fix it
high orlowaccording totheman’s position. Ihave
heard ofonecase inPerak, where thefinewas five
hundred dollars, andanother inwhich thesuitor, to
obtain hisbride, hadtopayonethousand seven hun-
dredand fifty dollars, namely, onethousand twohun-
dredand fifty dollars asafine,andfivehundred dollars
forthemarriage expenses. But inthiscase the girl
wasalready betrothed toanother, andonethousand

with their legsstretched put(belunjor kaki), thebody
being then laidacross their laps {riba). Several men
arethen told offtofetch water injars,scoop itoutof

means ofthe“scoop” {penchedok ayer), which isusu-

task finds novolunteers, inwhich case fivebanana

onwhich thebody israised from thefloorduring the
process ofwashing {meruang). When thebody is
ready forwashing, achief washer {orang meruang) is
engaged forafeeofabout adollar;this isusually the
Bilal orImam, who“shampoos” thebody whilst the

about twogallons, thewater atthetopbeing poured
offintoavessel ofsimilar capacity, andscooped up
and sprinkled asbefore onthecorpse. The next
washing iswith juice oflimes. Four orfivelimes
{liman nipis) aretaken, theends cut off,andeach lime
slashed crosswise onthetopwithout completely sever-
ingtheparts. These limes arethensqueezed {di-ramas-

washing repeated. The finalwashing, or“NineWaters”

VI WASHING THEBODY 401
(ayer sambilan,socalled from thewater being scooped
up,andpoured thrice tothe right, thrice tothe left,
andthrice over thefront ofthecorpse from head to
foot) isperformed with fresh water asatfirst,and
thewhole ceremony when completed iscalled bedara.
Thewashing completed, theorifices—
eg.ears, nostrils,
eyes—aregenerally stopped with cotton, andthebody
iscarried back toitsmattress, and laid inashroud of
white cotton cloth, which should beabout seven feet
longbyfour feet inwidth(salabuh),sothattheedges
meet over thebreast. After thisthelastkiss isgiven
bythenearest relatives, whomust not,however,disturb
thecorpse byletting their tears fallupon itsfeatures.
Theshroud isusually ofthree thicknesses inthecase
ofpoor people, butwealthier families use five,and
even seven -fold shrouds. InSelangor, however,
eachshroud isusually aseparate piece ofcloth. The
deadbody ofachild issometimes covered inaddition
with afinesortofwhite powder (aboktanah ortaya-

Five knots areused infastening theshroud, theends
being drawn upand tied [hochong) bymeans ofthe

likestrips /which arebound thrice round thebody at
thebreast, theknees, and thehips respectively, as

thejug until thewater becomes appreciably scented;
about twenty leaves ofthesweet-scented pandanus

“Centipedes’ Feet” (jari lipan)> about three feet
longbytwo fingers inbreadth, and laid atshort

five tosixofthese floral strips, theareca blossom
alternating with thepandanus. Thenumber of

sending him tothegrave, partly because ofthe
pahala ormerit thereby obtained, and partly (no

special dress orsignofmourning, such asthewhite
sashwithcoloured ribbon which issometimes worn at
Singapore (unless thekabong puteh orstrip ofwhite

TheImam then reads prayers, and thecompany

forthree days every night atabout ten p.m. the

moderation in,diet.Toenforce these golden precepts,
passages from theKoran areplentifully quoted against
excess ineating ordrinking. Air,they say, isthe
cause ofheatand moisture, and earth ofcoldand
dryness. They assimilate theconstitution andpassions
ofman tothetwelve signs oftheZodiac, andtheseven
planets, etc.”
“The mysterious sympathy between man and
external nature .... wasthebasis ofthatsystem
ofsupernatural magic which prevailed inEurope during
theMiddle Ages.”1
Theforegoing quotation shows thatthedistinctive
features oftheAristotelian hygienic theory, asborrowed
bytheArabs, dideventually filter through (insome
cases) until they reached theMalays. Such direct
references, however, toGreek theories areoftherarest
character, andcanhardly beconsidered typical.
Most ofthemore important rites practised bythe
Malay medicine-men(Bomor2
)maybedivided into
two well-defined parts. Commencing with acere-
monial “inspection ”(thecounterpart ofourmodern
“diagnosis”), theBomor proceeds tocarry outa
therapeutic ceremony, thenature ofwhich isdecided
bytheresults ofthe“inspection.” Forthepurposes
ofthediagnosis heresorts todivination, bymeans of
omens taken from thesmoke oftheburning censer,
from theposition ofcoins thrown into water-jars
(batu buyong),andparched rice floating upon the

TheWave- Offering
Onone occasion, during myresidence inthe
Kuala Langat district ofSelangor, Ihadthegood
fortune tobepresent atthe“waving” ofasacrificial tray
(anchak) containing offerings tothe spirits. The ac-
count ofthisceremony, which Ishallnow give, ismade
upfrom notes taken during theactual performance. To
commence:—ThePawang satdown with hisback to
thepatient, facing amultitude ofdishes which con-
tained thevarious portions ofcooked anduncooked
food. The tray itselfwassuspended ataheight of
about three feetfrom theground inthecentre ofthe
room, just infront ofthePawangs head. Lighting a
waxtaper andremoving theyam-leaf covering from
themouth ofthejarcontaining “holy” water, the
Pawang now“inspected”thewater inthejarby
gazing intently into itsdepths, andre-extinguished the
taper. Then hefumigated hishands inthesmoke of
thecenser, extended them forabrief interval over the
“holy”water, took thecenser inboth hands, described
three circles round thejarwith it,set itdown again,


VI WAVINGTHEANCHAK419
and stirred thewater thrice with asmall knife or
dagger(k'rts), theblade ofwhich hekept inthewater
while hemuttered acharm tohimself. Then he
charmed thebetel-stand andthe firstdish ofcooked
food, pushing the latter aside and covering it
with asmall dish-cover ashefinished thecharm.
Next, atthehands ofoneofthecompany, heaccepted,
intwo pieces, fivecubits ofyellow cloth (yellow being
theroyal colour), andasmall vessel of“oilofCelebes,”
with which, itmaybeadded, heanointed thepalms of
bothhands before hetouched thecloth itself. Next,
hefumigated thelatter inthesmoke ofthecenser, one
endofthecloth being grasped firmly intheright hand,
andtheremainder ofitbeing passed round theright
wrist, andoverandunder theright arm, while the
looseendtrailed across hislap. Next, after repeating
theusual charm, hebreathed ononeendofthecloth,
passed thewhole ofthecloth through hisfingers,
fumigated it,and laid itaside;tookaneggwhich was
presented tohimupon atray,anddeposited itexactly
inthecentre ofalarge dish ofparched rice. Next,
hepushed aside thejarofholy water, lowered thetray
bymeans ofthecordattached toit(which passed over
abeam), andproceeded tosupervise thepreparation of
the tray,which wasbeing decorated with the“centi-
pede” fringe byone ofthecompany acting asan
assistant. The fringe having been fitted bythelatter
totheedges ofthetray,andthelatter lined with three
thicknesses ofbanana leaf, thePawang described a
circle round itthrice with thecenser, andthen de-
posited thecenser upon the floor, exactly under the
centre ofthetray. Then anointing hishands again he
passed them overboth trayand fringe. Abriefpause
followed, andthen thePawang took thelarger piece of


420 MEDICINE CHAP.
yellow cloth andwrapped itlikearoyal robearound
theshoulders ofthepatient ashesatupinside his
mosquito curtain. Another brief pause, and the
Pawang betook himself oncemore tothefilling ofthe
tray. Taking alarge bowl ofparched rice,hescooped
uptherice inhishands, and let itrunthrough his
fingers intothetray, until there wasalayer ofparched
rice inthelatter ofatleastaninch indepth, andthen
deposited theegg, already alluded to,inthevery
centre oftheparched rice. Next hetook acomb of
bananas (presented byoneofthecompany), andcut-
tingthem offonebyonedeposited them inadish,
fromwhich theywere presently transferred tothetray.
ThePawang nowreturned tothepatient, andkneeling
down infront ofhim,fumigated hishands inthesmoke
ofthecenser, and then, muttering acharm, wrapped
thesmaller piece ofyellow cloth turban-wise round his
ownhead, andslowly andcarefully pushed theyellow-
robed patient (whowas still inasitting posture) for-
ward untilhereached aspotwhich wasexactly under
thecentre ofthetray,andwhich faced, Iwas told, the
“place oftheRising Sun.”
The long straw-coloured streamers ofthetray-
fringe dropped gracefully around thepatient onevery
side,andhad itnotbeen foroccasional bright glimpses
oftheyellow cloth hewould have been almost in-
visible.
The censer, voluming upwards itsash-gray smoke,
wasnowpassed fromhand tohand three times round
thepatient, and finally deposited onthe floor athis
feet.
Theloading ofthetraynowrecommenced, andthe
Pawang standing upandlooking towards thesouth,
deposited in itcarefully the several portions of


VI CONTENTS OFTHEANCHAK 42
“cooked” offerings (thesum ofthevarious portions
making upawhole fowl). Then, afterwashing his
hands, headded tothetraysmall portions ofricevari-
ously prepared andcoloured (viz.parched andwashed
rice,and ricestained yellow (saffron), green, red, blue,
andblack, seven kinds inall). Next hedeposited in
the tray theuncooked portions, whose sum also
amounted toawhole fowl, then, after afurther hand-
washing, the“cakes,” and finally, after alastwashing,
hefastened tothe“suspenders”1ofthetraythesmall
ornamental rice-bags called ketupat andlepat .2
Butthe listofcreature comforts provided forthe
spirits comprised other things besides food. Five
miniature water -buckets, each manufactured from a
strip ofbanana leafskewered together ateachend
with abamboo pin,werenow filled, thealternate
corner oneswithwater andcane-juice (called “palm-
toddy” intheSpirit Language), andthecentral onewith
theblood ofthefowls killed forthe sacrifice. They
were then dulydeposited inthetraybythePawang.
Fivewaxen tapers, to“light thespirits totheir food,”
were next“charmed” andlighted, andplanted inthe
centre andfourcorners respectively.
Finally, nodoubt forthespirits’ after-dinner enjoy-
ment, five“chews” ofbetel-leaf and fivenative-made
cigarettes (tobacco rolled instrips ofpalm-leaf), were
charmed and actually lighted atalamp, anddeposited
inthetraywith theother offerings, and atthesame

time five50cent (silver) pieces ofStraits money, called
“tray-stones,” were added tothemedley, evidently
with theobject ofpreventing thegood temper of
the spirits from being disturbed by“shortness of
cash.”
The loading ofthetraybeing nowcomplete, the
Pawang walked thrice round thepatient (whowas still
overshadowed bythe tray), andpassed thecenser
round him thrice. Standing thenwith hisface tothe
east, soastolook inthesame direction asthepatient,
hegrasped the“suspenders”ofthetray with both
hands attheirconverging point, andthrice muttered a
charm, giving adownward tugtothecord ofthetray
attheendofeach repetition. This done, heremoved
theyellow cloth from hishead, andfastened itround
thetray-cord atthepointwhere the“suspenders”con-
verged, andthen“waved" theoffering bycausing the
loaded tray with itsflaring tapers toswing slowly
backwards andforwards justover thepatient’s head.
Next, letting thetray slowly down anddetaching it
from the cord, attheconverging point, heagain
“waved" itslowly toand froamid theflaring ofthe
tapers, seven times insuccession, andheld itoutfor
thepatient tospit into. When thiswasdone he
sallied outintothedarkness ofthenight carrying the
tray,andgaining thejungle, suspended itfrom atree
(ofthekind called petai belalang) which hadbeen
selected thatverydayforthepurpose. Awhite ant,
immediately settling upon theoffering, was hailed by
theMalays present with great delight asasign that
thespirits hadaccepted theoffering, whereupon weall
returned tothehouse andthecompany broke up.The
ceremony hadcommenced about 8p.m.,and lasted
about anhourand ahalf,andthenumber ofpeople


VI THELIMAS 423
present was fourteen, seven male andseven female,
which wasthenumber stipulated bythePawang.
Another form of“propitiation”(buang-buangan
limas) ceremony consists inloading alimas with
theofferings. The limas isareceptacle ofabout
aspan(sa-jengkal)inlength, made ofbanana -leaf
folded together attheendsandskewered withabam-
boo pin. Inside itaredeposited theofferings, which
consist ofthe following articles :achupak (half
cocoa-nutful) of“parched”rice, asetofthree, five,
orseven bananas, a“pinch”(sa-jemput)of“saffron”
rice, apinch of“washed”rice, anative cigarette
(rokok)}anegg, awax taper, two“chews” ofbetel-
leaf,andabetel-leaf twisted upintotheshape ofa
spiral {pantat siput). One (atleast) ofthetwo
“chews” ofbetelmust bespecially prepared, as itis
tobeleftbehind forthe spirits tochew, whilst the
other istaken back into thepresence ofthesick
man, where themedicine -manchews itand ejects
thechewed leaf(di-sembor)upon the“small”ofthe
sickmans back. Inthecase ofthe“chew” which
isleftbehind forthe spirits, theordinary portion of
betel -nutmust bereplaced bynutmeg, thegambier
bymace, andthelimeby“oil ofCelebes”(minyak
Bugis).
When theceremony ofloading thelimas is
complete, itiscarried down tothenearest river
orsea,and there set adrift with the following
words:—
“Peace bewith you, Khailir (Khizr), Prophet ofGodandLord
ofwater,
Maduraya isthename ofyour sire,
Madaruti thename ofyourmother,
SiKekas thename oftheir child;
Accept thispresent fromyouryounger brother, SiKekas,


424 MEDICINE CHAP.
Cause himnosickness orheadache.
Here ishis,youryounger brother’s, present.”
Here theLimas issetadrift, andthewater underneath
itscooped upandcarried home, where itisused for
bathing thesickman.
Another very simple form of“propitiation”is
called ambang -ambangan, and isperformed as
follows:—
Take seven “chews” ofbetel-leaf, seven native
cigarettes(rokok),seven bananas, anegg, andan
overflowing chupak (half cocoa-nutful) ofparched
rice (bertih sa-chupak abong),1rollthem allup
together inabanana leaf(which must beacubit in
length andofthesame variety ofbanana asthe first),
anddeposit them inaplacewhere three roads meet
(ifanything “a littlewayalong theleft-hand road of
thethree,”) andrepeat thischarm:—
“Jembalang Jembali, Demon oftheEarth,
Accept thisportion asyourpayment
And restore So-and-So.
But ifyoudonotrestore him
Ishall curse youwith thesaying,
‘There isnogodbutGod,’”etc.
Theabove ceremony isgenerally used inthecase
offever complaint.
Counter -charms for“neutralising” the active
principle ofpoisons form, asarule,oneofthemost
important branches ofthepharmacopceic system
among the less civilised Malay tribes. Asettled
form ofgovernment andthesoftening ofmanners
due tocontact withEuropean civilisation has,how-
ever, diminished theimportance (Ispeak, ofcourse,

VI NEUTRALISING POISONS 425
from theMalay point ofview) ofthisbranch ofthe
subject intheWestern Malay States ofthePenin-
sula,where poisoning cases arevery rarely heard of.
Malay women have always possessed thereputation
ofbeing especially proficient intheuseofpoison;
ground glass and thefurry spicules obtained from
theleaf-cases ofsome kinds ofbamboo being their
favourite weapons.
This idea (ofusing acharm to“neutralise” the
active principle ofpoison) hasbeen extended by
Malay medicine -men tocover allcases where any
evil principle (even, forinstance, afamiliar spirit) is
believed tohave entered thesick person’s system.
Allsuch charms arepiously regarded bydevout
Muhammadans asgifts due tothemercy ofGod,
who isbelieved tohave sentthem down tothe
Prophet Muhammad bythehand ofhisservant Gab-
riel. This doctrine wefind clearly stated inthe
charms themselves, eg.(somewhat tautologically):—
“Neutralising charms sprang fromGod,
Neutralising charms were created byGod,
Neutralising charms were aboon fromGod,
Whocommanded Prince Gabriel
Tobringthem untoMuhammad.”
Theceremony ofapplying suchcharms generally
takes theform ofgrating abezoar -stone1
(batu
guliga),mixing theresult with water, anddrinking
itafter repeating thecharm.
Thus inoneofthecharms quoted intheAppendix
weread:—
“TheUpas loses itsvenom,

tooareanimate objects from theMalay point ofview.]
Von deWall describes itas“the enchanting or

from atigerwhich onesees,3from apoison-tree which

medicine. Imaytake thisopportunity ofpointing out
that Ihave used theword “mischief” totranslate it
when dealing with thecharms, asthis isthenearest
English equivalent which Ihave been able tofind
;
indeed, itappears avery fairly exact equivalent when
weremember itsuse inEnglish insuch phrases as
“It’sgotthemischief init,”which issometimes used
even ofinanimate objects.
There areahundred andninety ofthese mischiefs,
according tosome, according toothers, ahundred
andninety-three. Their origin isvery variously given.
One authority says that the first badi sprang from
three drops ofAdam’s blood (which were spilton
theground). Another (rather inconsistently) declares
that the“mischief”(badi)residing inaniguana
(ibiawak)wastheorigin ofallsubsequent “mischiefs,”
yetadds later thatthe“Heart ofTimber” was their
origin, andyetagain that theyellow glow atsunset
(called Mambang Kuning orthe“Yellow Deity”)
was their origin. These two latter are,perhaps the
most usual theories, butathird medicine-man declares
thatthefirstbadiwastheoffspring oftheJin(“genie”)
IbnUjan (Ibnu Jan?), who resides intheclouds (or
caverns?)andhollows ofthe hills. Thus doMalay
medicine-men disagree.
These “mischiefs”reside notonly inanimate, but
also ininanimate objects. Thus inoneofthe ele-
phant-charms given intheAppendix several different
“mischiefs”aredescribed asresiding inearth, ant-
hills,wood, water, stone, andelephants (orrhinoceroses)
respectively. Again, inadeer-charm, various “mis-
chiefs”arerequested toreturn totheir place oforigin,
i.e. totheIguana (strictly speaking, theMonitor
Lizard), Heart ofTimber, and theYellow Glow of

Sunset. Yetanother deer-charm callsupon “Badi”
(astheoffspring oftheJin IbnUjan,who resides in
theclouds andhollows ofthe hills), toreturn thereto .1
Iwillnowproceed todescribe theceremony of
“casting out” these “mischiefs.”
The chief occasions onwhich thiscasting outtakes
place are, first,when somebody isill,andhissickness
isattributed tohisaccidental contact with (and conse-
quent “possession by”)oneofthese mischiefs;and,
secondly, when any wild animal orbird iskilled.
Theceremony ofcasting outthemischief from the
carcases ofbiggame willbefound described under
theheading of“Hunting Ceremonies.” Ishall here
confine myself toabrief description oftheceremony
asconducted forthebenefit ofsickpersons.
Firstmake upabunch ofleaves(sa-cherek),con-
sisting oftheshrubs called pulut-pulut andselaguri,
with branches ofthegandarusa and lenjziang merah
(red dracaena), allofwhich arewrapped together ina
leafofthesi-pulih,and tiedround with apiece of
tree-bark(kulit frap\ ortheakar gastng-gasing.
With thisleaf-brush youaretocastoutthemischief.
Then yougrate ontoasaucer small pieces ofebony
wood, brazil wood, “laka ”wood, sandalwood, and
eagle-wood (lignaloes), mixthem with water, putting
inafew small pieces ofscrap-iron, and rubthe
patient allover with themixture.
1VideApp. lx., lxxii., lxxix. The
different names under which “Badi”
isinvoked areworth noting;e.g.

Asyoudothis, repeat theappropriate charm;
then take thebrush ofleaves andstroke thepatient
alloverdownwards fromhead tofoot,saying :—

This spear must afterwards beransomed, (say) for

The directions foranother form oftheceremony

VI CEREMONIES ANDCHARMS 43
youmust rubhim(orher) allover with limes inorder
to“castoutthemischief.” These limes must beof
seven different kinds, andyou willrequire three of
each kind. When youhave gotthem, fumigate them
with incense andrepeat theappropriate charm, which
ispractically anappeal addressed tothe spirit ofthe
limes toassist inextracting thepoisonous principle
from thebody ofthesickman:—
“Peace bewith you,OLelang,
Wehavebeen brothers from theformer time untilnow,
Iamfain toorder youtoassistmeinextracting everything that
ispoisonous
From thebodyandlimbs ofSo-and-So.
Break notyoursolemn promise,
Break notyour plighted faith,

Ofcourse theluckless spirit istoldthat ifhedoes
notdoexactly asheisbidden hemust expect thecurse

Thischarm must berepeated overnight, andearly
nextmorning three thicknesses ofbirah leaves must

distance from thehouse. The only special taboo
mentioned forthisceremony isthatthepatient must
notduring itscontinuance meetanybody whohascome
from adistance.
Another very curious form ofthisceremony of
“casting outdevils”wasdescribed tomebyaKelan-
tanMalay. Itisworked onthesubstitute or“scape-
goat” principle (tukar ganti), andtheidea istomake
littledough images ofallkinds ofbirds, beasts, fishes,
andeven inanimate objects (afewoftheformer being
fowls, ducks, horses, apes, buffaloes, bullocks, wild
cattle(seladang),deer, mouse-deer, and elephants,
besides those enumerated inthecharm itself, whilst
exceptions aretobethe“unlucky” animals(benatang
sial)such ascats, tigers, pigs,dogs, snakes, andiguanas).
When made they aretobedeposited together ina
heapupon asacrificial tray(anchak),together with
betel-leaves, cigarettes, andtapers. One ofthetapers
ismade tostand upon asilver dollar, with theendof
apiece ofparticoloured thread inserted between the
dollar andthefootofthetaper;andtheother endof
thisthread isgiven tothepatient tohold whilst the
necessary charm isbeing repeated.
Partofthischarm isworth quoting, as ithelps to
explain the line ofthought onwhich themedicine-
man isworking:—
“Ihavemade asubstitute foryou,
Andengage you forhire.
Asforyourwish toeat, Igiveyoufood,
Asforyour wish todrink, Igiveyoudrink.
Lo, Igiveyougoodmeasure whether ofsharks,
Skates, lobsters, crabs, shell-fish (both oflandandsea)—
Every kind ofsubstitute Igiveyou,
Good measure whether offlesh orofblood, bothcooked andraw.
Accept, accept duly thisbanquet ofmine.


VI THESPIRIT BOAT 433
Itwasgood atthe first :ifitisnotgood now,
Itisnot Iwhogive it.”
The explanation ofthis part oftheceremony is
thattheevil spirit, or“mischief,” issupposed toleave
thebody ofthesickman,and toproceed (guided, of
course, bythemany-coloured thread which thepatient
holds inhishand) toenter intothechoice collection of
“scapegoats”lying inthetray. Assoon ashisdevil-
ship isgot fairly intothetray, themedicine-man looses
three slip-knots(lepas-lepas\ andrepeats acharm to
induce theevil spirit togo,andthrows away theuntied
knots outside thehouse.
The original “disease-boat”used inSelangor was
amodel ofaspecial kind ofMalay vessel called lan-
chang. This lanchang wasatwo-masted vessel with
galleries(dandan)foreand aft,armed with cannon,
andused byMalay Rajas ontheSumatran coast.
This latter factwas,nodoubt, onereason foritsbeing
selected asthetypeofboatmost likely toprove accept-
able tothespirits. Tomake itstillfurther acceptable,
however, themodel wasnotunfrequently stained with
turmeric orsaffron, yellow being recognised asthe
royal colour among theMalays.
Occasionally, ontheother hand, amere raft(rakit)
isset adrift, sometimes asmall model ofthebalei
(state-chamber), andsometimes only asetofthe
banana-leaf receptacles called limas.
The vessel inthecase ofanimportant person is
occasionally ofgreat sizeandexcellent finish—indeed,
local tradition has itthatanexceptionally large and
perfect specimen (which waslaunched upon theKlang
river inSelangor some years ago,ontheoccasion of
anillness oftheTungku ’Chik, eldest daughter ofthe
late Sultan), wasactually towed down toseabythe


434 MEDICINE CHAP.
Government steam launch ‘Abdul Samad. When all
isready thelanchang isloaded with offerings, which
areofanexactly similar character tothose which are
deposited onthe sacrificial tray oranchak1already
described. Then oneendofapiece ofyellow thread
isfastened tothepatient’s wrist (theother endbeing
presumably made fasttothespirit-boat, orlanchang);
incense isburnt andacharm recited, thepurport of
itbeing topersuade the evil spirits which have taken
possession ofthepatient toenter onboard thevessel.
This, when they arethought tohave done so, is
then2taken down totheseaorriver and setadrift,
invariably attheebb tide,which issupposed tocarry
theboat(and thespirits with it)“toanother country.”
Oneofthecharms used atthisstage oftheceremony
even mentions thename ofthecountry towhich the
devils aretobecarried, theplace singled out for
this distinction being theIsland ofCelebes !The
passage inquestion runs asfollows:—
“Peace beunto you, Devils ofthesea,andDemons ofthesea,
Neither oncape, norbay,norsandbank beyestuck orstranded !
This vessel(lanchang)isthatofArong,3
1Vide pp.418seqq.,supra.
Strictly speaking, money (which
iscalled batu-batu lanchang oxlanchang
stones) should always form partofthem.
InKedah three kenderi (one kenderi
amounting tothree cents) aresaid to
beused;inPerak threewang
}and in
Selangor three duits (cents).
2Ibelieve this usually takes place
immediately after theceremony, but
onemedicine-man whom Iknew (’Che
Amal ofJugra) used tokeep theboat
intowhich the spirits were thought to
haveentered until thepatient recovered,
andthen set itadrift. When the
medicine-man islaunching it,hetakes
theboat inboth hands, andrepeatedly
gives itarotatory movement towards
the left (as ifhewere using asieve),and repeats thecharm. Asmall
portion ofeach dish deposited inthe
lanchang hastobecarried back tothe
patient’s house, andthere administered
tothe patient, together with water
scooped upinabowl from underneath
thelanchang asitlayinthewater be-
fore drifting away. Asthesickman
receives theofferings, theperson who
administers them says, addressing the
spirit ofevil,“Here isyour wage,
return notback hereuntoSo-and-So;
andcause himtobesicknomore,” and
the spirit replies through theman’s
mouth, “Iwillnever return.”

To itsown place.

Thissamecharm isused mutatis mutandis forthe
Balei (Spirit-hall).
Acommon form ofthe“Lanchang” charm runs
asfollows:—
“Ho,elders oftheupper reaches,
Elders ofthelower reaches,
Elders ofthedryland,
Elders oftheriver-flats,
Assemble ye,Opeople, Lords ofhilland hill-foot,
Lords ofcavern andhill-locked basin,

Sometimes thecrocodile-spirit isrequested toact
astheforwarding agent inthetransaction;thuswe
findashort lanchang -charm running asfollows:—
“Ho,Elder oftheSloping Bank, Jambu Agai,1
Receive this(lanchang) andforward ittotheRiver-Bay,

Asomewhat longer charm, which isgiven inthe
Appendix, commences bymaking aninteresting
point—
“Peace bewithyou !Ocrewnewly come from yourshipwrecked
barque onthehigh seas,
Spurned bythebillows, blown about bythegale;
Come onboard (this lanchang) inturnandgetyoufood.”
Thespeaker goesontosaythatherecognises their
right tolevy toll allover thecountry, andhasmade
thislanchang forthem asasubstitute(tukar ganti),
implying, nodoubt, inplace oftheonewhich they
had lost. Inany case, however, there canbelittle
doubt thatthe“barque wrecked onthehigh seas”is
thewasted body ofthesickman, ofwhich thespirits
were sorecently inpossession, and insubstitution for
which they areoffered thespirit-boat inquestion.
Tiger Spirit
Ishallnowproceed todescribe theceremony of
invoking theTiger Spirit forthepurpose ofobtaining
hisassistance inexpelling arival spirit oflesspower.
Intheautumn of1896 (intheKuala Langat District
ofSelangor) thebrother ofmyMalay collector ‘Umar
happening tofall illofsome slight ailment, Iasked
andobtained permission tobepresent attheceremony
ofdoctoring the patient. The time fixed forthe
commencement oftheceremony (which isusually
repeated forthree consecutive nights) was seven
o’clock onthefollowing evening. Onreaching the

house atthetime appointed Iwasmetby‘Umar,
andascending thehouse -ladder, was invited toseat
myself upon amatabout twoyards from thespot
where themedicine-man wasexpected totakeuphis
position. Having done so,and looking round, I
found that there were inallnine persons present
(including myself, butexclusive ofthePawang, his
wife, orthepatient), and Iwasinformed thatalthough
itisnotnecessary forthesame persons tobepresent
oneach ofthethree nights, thegreatest caremust
betaken toseethat thenumber ofpersons present,
which should never, instrictness, beaneven number,
does notvary from night tonight, because toallow

Imyself wasonlyenabled tobepresent asasubsti-

Meanwhile themedicine -man was notbackward
inhispreparations fortheproper reception ofthe
spirit. First hescattered incense ontheembers and
fumigated himself therewith, “shampooing” himself,
sotospeak, with hishands, and literally bathing
inthecloud ofincense which volumed upfrom the
newly-replenished censer andhung likeadense gray
mist over hishead. Next heinhaled theincense
through his nostrils, andannounced intheaccents
ofwhat iscalled the spirit- language (bhasa bantu)
thathewasgoing to“liedown.” This heaccord-
ingly did, reclining upon hisback, anddrawing the
upper endofhislong plaid sarong over hishead
soastocompletely conceal hisfeatures. The invo-
cation wasnotyetended, and forsome timewesat
inthesilence ofexpectation. Atlength, however,
themoment ofpossession arrived, andwith aviolent
convulsive movement, which was startling in its
suddenness, the “Pawang”rolled over ontohis
face. Again abrief interval ensued, and asecond
butsomewhat less violent spasm shook hisframe,
thespasm .being strangely followed byadryand
ghostly cough. Amoment later and thePawang,
stillwith shrouded head, was seated bolt upright
facing thetambourine player. Then hefronted round,
still inasitting posture, until hefaced thejars,and
removed theyam -leaf covering from themouth of

Next hekindled awaxtaper attheflame ofalamp

similar tapers having been kindled andplanted upon

partook ofa“chew”ofbetel-leaf (which waspresented
tohimbyoneofthewomen present), crooning the
while tohimself.
This refreshment concluded, hedrew from his

handfuls ofrice(“parched,” “washed,” and“saffron”
rice), and after afurther inspection declared, inshrill,
unearthly accents, thateach ofthecoins was lying
exactly under itsownrespective taper, and thatthere-
fore his“child” (the sickman)wasverydangerously
ill,though hemight yetpossibly recover with theaid
ofthespirit. Next, scattering thericeround therow
ofjars (thetrack ofthe ricethusforming anellipse),
hebroke offseveral small blossom-stalks from asheaf
ofareca-palm blossom, andmaking them upwith
sprays ofchampaka into three separate bouquets,
placed oneofthese improvised nosegays ineach ofthe
three jars ofwater. Onthefloor attheback ofthe

rowofjarshenextdeposited apiece ofwhite cloth,
five cubits inlength, which hehad just previously
fumigated. Again drawing thedagger already re-
ferred to,thePawang nowsuccessively plunged itup
tothe hiltintoeach ofthethree bouquets (inwhich
hostile spirits might, Iwas told, possibly belurking).
Then seizing anunopened blossom-spathe oftheareca-
palm, heanointed the latter allover with “oil of
Celebes,” extracted thesheaf ofpalm-blossom from its
casing, fumigated it,and laid itgently across the
patient’s breast. Rapidly working himself upintoa
state ofintense excitement, andwith gestures ofthe
utmost vehemence, henowproceeded to“stroke” the
patient with thesheaf ofblossom rapidly downwards,
inthedirection ofthefeet,onreaching which hebeat
outtheblossom against thefloor. Then turning the
patient overontohisface,andrepeating thestroking
process, heagain beatouttheblossom, andthensank
back exhausted upon the floor, where helayface
downwards, with hishead oncemore enveloped inthe
folds ofthesarong.
Along interval now ensued, but atlength, after
many convulsive twitchings, theshrouded figure arose,
amid theintense excitement oftheentire company,
andwentupon itshands and feet.TheTiger Spirit
hadtaken possession ofthePawang’s body, and
presently alow, butstartlingly life-like growl—the
unmistakable growl ofthedreaded “Lord ofthe
Forest”—seemed toissue fromsomewhere under our
feet, astheweird shrouded figure began scratching
furiously atthematupon which ithadbeen quietly
lying, andthen, withoccasional pauses fortheemission
ofthegrowls, which hadpreviously startled us,andthe
performance ofwonderful cat-like leaps, rapidly licked


VI POSSESSION 443
upthehandfuls ofricewhich hadbeen thrown upon
thefloor infront ofit.This part oftheperformance
lasted, however, butafew minutes, andthen the
evident excitement oftheonlookers was raised to
fever pitch, asthe bizarre, and, as itseemed toour
fascinated senses, strangely brute-like form stooped
suddenly forward, andslowly licked over, asatigress
would lick itscub, the allbutnaked body ofthe
patient—aperformance (toaEuropean) ofsopower-
fully nauseating acharacter that itcanhardly be
conceived thatanyhuman being could persist in it
unless hewasmore orlessunconscious ofhisactions.
Atallevents, after hiscomplete return toconsciousness
attheconclusion oftheceremony, even thePawang
experienced asevere attack ofnausea, such asmight
wellbesupposed tobetheresult ofhisperformance.
Meanwhile, however, theceremony continued. Revert-
ingtoasitting posture (though stillwithshrouded
head), thePawang now leaned forward over the
patient, andwith thepoint ofhisdagger drew blood
from hisownarm;then rising tohisfeetheengaged
inafierce hand-to-hand combat with hisinvisible foe
(the spiritwhom hehadbeensummoned toexorcise).
Atfirst hisweapon wasthedagger, butbefore longhe
discarded this,andlaidabout himstoutly enough with
thesheaf ofareca-palm blossom.
Presently, however, hequieted down somewhat,
andcommenced to“stroke” thesickman (asbefore)
with thesheaf ofpalm -blossom, beating outthe
blossom upon the floor asusual attheendofthe
operation. Then sitting down again andcrooning to
himself, hepartook ofbetel-leaf, faced round towards
thepatient andstooped over him,muttering ashedid
so,andpassing hishands allover theprostrate form.


444 MEDICINE CHAP.
Next heturned once more tothejarsandagain
plunged hisdagger intoeach ofthem inturn (tomake
sure thattheevil spirit wasnotlurking inthem), and
thendrawing hishead-cloth over hishead soasto
completely hide hisface, heoncemore took hisseat
beside thepatient, stooping overhimfrom time to
timeandcrooning charms ashedidso.
Finally heclapped hishands, removed hishead-
cloth, “stroked”thepatient overandflicked himwith
thecorners of it,andthen shrouding himself once
more inthesarong,laydown atfulllength inastate
ofcomplete exhaustion. Apause ofabout tenminutes’
duration nowfollowed, andthenwithsundry convulsive
twitchings thePawang returned toconsciousness and
satup,andtheceremony wasover.
Thefollowing description ofaceremony similar to
theonejustdescribed istaken fromMalay Sketches :—
“The ber-hantu is,ofcourse, asurvival ofprse-

great repute inherowncountry andamong herown
people. Inordinary lifeshewasanamusing lady
named Raja Ngah, ascion ofthereigning house on
thefemale side,andamember ofafamily skilled inall
matters pertaining tooccultism. Inacorner ofthe
room were five orsixgirls holding native drums,
instruments with askin stretched over one side
only,and this isbeaten usually with thefingers. The
leader ofthisorchestra was thedaughter ofRaja
Ngah.
“Shortly after Isatdown, theproceedings began
bythePawang covering herhead and facewith a
silken cloth, while theorchestra began tosingaweird
melody inanunknown tongue. Iwastold itwasthe
spirit language;the airwasonespecially pleasing to
aparticular Jin, orSpirit, andtheinvocation, after
reciting hispraises, besought him tocome from the
mountains orthesea,from underground oroverhead,
andrelieve thetorments oftheKing.
“Asthesong continued, accompanied bythe
rhythmical beating ofthedrums, thePawang satwith
shrouded head infront ofthelighted taper, holding in
herrighthand against her leftbreast asmall sheaf of
thegrass called daunsambau,tiedtightly together and

;then, rising toherfeetand
followed bytheattendant, sheperformed thesame
ceremony before each malemember ofthereigning

string ofgibberish addressed totheSpirit. This done,
sheresumed herseatonthemat, and, after abrief
pause, theminstrels struck upadifferent air,and,
singing thepraises ofanother Jin ,called uponhimto
come andrelieve theKing’s distress.
“Iascertained thateachMalay State has itsown

Inthisparticular State there arefour principal Jin;

“Then there isKemala ajaib,the‘Wonderful Jewel,’

“Meanwhile asixteen-sided stand, about sixinches

the floor near thePawangs mat.
Thestand wasdecorated withyellow

There was justroom tositonthis

shouted forhimwith alltheir might.
“TheSultan satthere forsome time, occasionally
giving aconvulsive shudder, andwhen this taper
hadduly flared up,and allthe riteshadbeen per-
formed, HisHighness wasconducted back again to

“Whilst striding across thefloor shesuddenly fell

“Just before dawn there wasasudden confusion

“TheKing didnotdie,after all—onthecontrary, I

tolive tillthemorning, andyethecheated Death—for

Theceremony called Mengalin, orthe “sucking
charm”ceremony, isonewhich isvery curious, and
deserves tobedescribed insome detail.
First ofallyouperform theceremony called “Driv-
ingouttheMischief”(buang badi)from thesick
man (vide supra) inorder todriveaway allevil spirits
(menolak sakalian chengkedi atau hantu). Then wrap
thepatient upinawhite orblack cloth, andtaking a
ballof(kneaded) dough(tepong pengalin),eggs and
saffron, repeat thesuitable charm, and roll itallover
theskin ofthepatient’s body inorder todraw out
allpoisonous influences(menchabut saga/a bisa-bisa).
Then ifyoufindinside theballofdough afteropening

Asecond charm ofgreat length follows, theobject
ofwhich istodrive outtheevil spirit inpossession of
theman.
Anexample ofthisform ofcure aspractised by
Malay medicine -men isreferred tobyMr. Clifford,
who, inspeaking ofhispunkah-puller, Umat, says:—
“Itwassoon after hismarriage that histrouble fell
uponUmat, andswept much ofthesunshine from his
life.Hecontracted aform ofophthalmia, and fora
timewas blind. Native Medicine Mendoctored him,
anddrewsheaves ofneedles andbunches ofthorns from
hiseyes, which they declared were thecause ofhis
affliction. These miscellaneous oddsandendsused to
bebrought tomeatbreakfast-time, floating, most un-
appetisingly, inashallow cup half-full ofwater;and
Umat went abroad witheye-sockets stained crimson or
black, according tothefancy ofthenative physician.
The aidofanEnglish doctor was called in,butUmat
wastoothoroughly aMalay totrust themore simple
remedies prescribed tohim,andthough hisblindness
wasrelieved, andhebecame able towalk without the
aidofastaff, hiseyesight could never really begiven
back tohim.”1
Intheabove connection Imayremark that,whether
from theworking oftheirown imaginations orother-
wise, those whowere believed tobepossessed by
demons certainly suffered, andthat severely. H.H.

Selangor, wasattacked byafamiliar demon during my
residence intheLangat District, andshortly after-
wards commenced topineaway. Hedeclared that
theoffending demon was sitting inhisskull, atthe
back ofhishead, andthat itdragged upanddevoured
everything thatheswallowed. Hence herefused at
length toeatany sortofsolid food, andgradually
wasted away until hebecame amere skeleton, and
went about imploring people totake ahatchet and
split hisskull open, inorder toextract thedemon
which hebelieved ittocontain. Gradually hisstrength
failed, and atlength Ilearned fromH.H. theSultan
(then RajaMuda) that alltheMalays intheneigh-
bourhood hadassembled towail athisdecease. As
westrolled among thecocoa-nut palms and talked, I
toldhim ofthemany miraculous cures which had
attended cases offaith-healing inEngland, andsug-
gested, notofcourse expecting tobetaken seriously,
thatheshould trythe effect ofsuch acureupon his
uncle, and“make believe” toextract some “man-
uses” from theback ofhishead. Tomyintense
astonishment some days later, Ilearned that thisidea
hadbeen carried outduring mytemporary absence
from the district, and that theMuhammadan priest,
aftercupping himseverely, hadshown himseven large
mantises which hepretended tohave extracted from
theback ofhishead. Theexperiment proved extra-
ordinarily successful, andRajaKahar recovered atall
events forthetime. Hedeclared, however, thatthere
weremore ofthese mantises left,andeventually suffered
arelapse anddiedduring myabsence inEngland on
leave. Forthetime, however, theimprovement was
quite remarkable, andwhen SaidMashahor, thePeng-
hulu ofKerling, visited himafewdays later, Raja


452 MEDICINE CHAP.
Kahar, afteranaccount ofthecurefrom hisownpoint
ofview, declared thatnobody would now believe that
hehadbeen so ill,although “nofewer thanseven large
mantises” hadbeen “extracted from hishead.”
Inowgive aspecimen oftheceremonies used for
recalling awandering soulbymeans ofadough figure
orimage (gambar tepong). Itisnotstated whether
anyoftheusual accessories ofthese figures (hairand
nails, etc.) aremixed with thedough, butanoldand
famous soul-doctor (’Che Amal, ofJugra) toldmethat
thedough figure should bemade, instrictness, from
theballofkneaded dough which isrolled allover the
patient’s bodybythemedicine-man during the“suck-
ing-charm”ceremony(mengalin ).The directions for
making itrunasfollows:—
Make animage ofdough, inlength about nine
inches, andrepresenting theopposite sextothat of
thepatient. Deposit it(on itsback) upon fivecubits
ofwhite cloth, which must befolded upsmall forthe
purpose, andthen plant aminiature green umbrella
(made ofcloth coated thickly with wax,andstanding
from four tofiveinches inheight) atthehead ofthe
image, andasmall green clove-shaped taper (ofabout
thesame height) atitsfeet.Then burn incense;take
three handfuls each of“parched,” “washed,” and
“saffron” rice,andscatter them thrice round thefigure,
saying asyoudoso:—
“OFlying Paper,

And theUmbrella ofSiLanchang isopposite tome
Grant thisbyvirtue of‘There isnogodbutGod/ ”etc.
Thestatement that thisdough image should repre-
senttheopposite sex tothat ofthepatient should be
received with caution, andrequires further investigation
toclear itup.Myinformant explained thatthe“Fly-
ingPaper ”
(kretas layang-layang) referred tothesoul-
cloth, andthe“cup”totheimage, but ifthisexplana-
tion isaccepted, itisyetnotunlikely that arealcup
wasused intheoriginal charm. The “drunken stars”
heexplained asreferring totheparched ricescattered
onhis left,andthe fullmoon totheeyes oftheimage.
Arguing from theanalogy ofother ceremonies con-
ducted onthesame lines, thewandering soulwould
berecalled andinduced toenter theso-called cup(i.e .
thedough image), andbeing transferred thence tothe
soul-cloth underneath it,would bepassed ontothe
patient inthesoul-cloth itself.
Another way torecall asoul(which wastaught me
by’Che‘Abas ofKelantan) istotakeseven betel-leaves
withmeeting leaf-ribs(sirihbertemu urat),andmake
them upintoseven “chews” ofbetel. Then take a

atthefeetofthesickman, giving himoneendof
thethread tohold,andfastening theother end tothe

The soul isthen called upon toreturn tothehouse
which ithasdeserted, iscaught inasoul-cloth, and
passed (itisthought) first ofallintotheegg,and
thence back into thepatient’s bodybymeans ofthe
thread which connects theeggwith thepatient. The
charm runs asfollows:—

Another wayofrecalling thesoul isasfollows:—
Putsome husked rice inarice-bag(sumpit)with
anegg,anail,andacandle- nut;scatter it
(kirei)thrice
round thepatient shead, and deposit thebag be-

Butreturn toyourownhome.”
When three days have expired, gather upthe rice
again andput itallback intothebag. Ifthere isa

themedical performances that intheirmethods closely
resemble it,areregarded bymany respectable Malays:—

Dance Ceremonies
Thefollowing passage isanaccount ofacharacter-

performers todance fortheiramusement, andconsider
that‘thebetter part’iswith thosewho watch, at
their ease, theexertions ofasmall class, whose
members arenotheld inthehighest respect. The
spectacle usually provided isstrangely wanting in
attraction :acouple ofwomen shuffling their feet
andswaying their hands ingestures that arepracti-
cally devoid ofgrace oreven variety—that isthe
Malay dance—and itisaccompanied bythebeating
ofnative drums, thestriking together oftwoshort
sticks held ineither hand, andtheoccasional boom
ofametal gong. The entertainment hasanun-
doubted fascination forMalays, but itgenerally forms
part ofatheatrical performance, and forWestern
spectators itisimmeasurably dull .1
“InoneoftheMalay States, however, Pahang, it
has foryears been thecustom fortheruler andone
ortwoofhisnear relatives tokeep trained dancing
girls,who perform what iscalled the‘Joget’—a
realdance with anaccompaniment ofsomething like
realmusic, though theorchestral instruments arevery
rude indeed.
“The dancers, budak joget,belong totheRaja’s
household, theymayeven beattached tohimbya

ment oftheir lordand hisfriends, and thepublic
arenotadmitted. Years ago Isawsuch adance,2

made ourway totheastana,apicturesque, well-built,
andcommodious house onthe right bank ofthe
Pahang river.Apalisade enclosed thecourtyard,
and thefront ofthehouse was avery large hall,
open onthree sides, butcovered byalofty roof of
fantastic design supported onpillars. The floor of
this hallwasapproached bythree wide steps con-
tinued round thethree open sides, thefourth being
closed byawooden wallwhich entirely shut offthe
private apartments save forone central door over
which hung aheavy curtain. The three steps were
toprovide sitting accommodation according totheir
rank forthose admitted totheastana. Themiddle
ofthe floor onthenight inquestion wascovered
byalarge carpet, chairs were placed forus,andthe
restoftheguests satonthesteps ofthedais.
“When weentered, wesaw, seated onthecarpet,
four girls, twoofthem about eighteen andtwoabout
eleven years old, allattractive according toMalay
ideas ofbeauty, and allgorgeously andpicturesquely
clothed. Ontheirheads theyeachwore alarge and
curious butvery pretty ornament ofdelicate workman-

flowers were gold, trembling and glittering withevery

secured tothehead bytwisted cords ofsilver and
gold. The girls’ hair,combed down inafringe, was

becomingly dressed behind.
“Thebodices oftheir dresses weremade oftight-
fitting silk, leaving theneckandarms bare, whilst
awhite band offinecambric (about oneandahalf
inches wide), passing round theneck,camedown on
thefront ofthebodice intheform ofaV,andwas
there fastened byagolden flower. Round their
waists were belts fastened with large and curiously-
worked pinding orbuckles ofgold, solarge that
they reached quite across the waist. The rest
ofthecostume consisted ofaskirt ofcloth of
gold (not atalllike thesarong),reaching tothe
ankles, while ascarf ofthesame material, fastened
initscentre tothewaist-buckle, hungdown tothe
hem oftheskirt.
“Allfourdancers were dressed alike, except that
theolder girlswore white silkbodices with aredand
gold handkerchief, folded corner-wise, tiedunder the
armsandknotted infront. Thepoints ofthehandker-
chiefhung tothemiddle oftheback. Inthecaseofthe
twoyounger girls theentire dresswasofonematerial.
On their arms thedancers wore numbers ofgold
bangles, and their fingers were covered withdiamond
rings. Intheir earswere fastened thediamond
buttons somuch affected byMalays, andindeed now
byWestern ladies. Their feet, ofcourse, were bare.
We hadample time tominutely observe these
details before thedance commenced, forwhen we
came intothe hallthefour girls were sitting down
intheusual1Eastern fashion onthecarpet, bending
forward, their elbows resting ontheir thighs, and

hiding thesides oftheir faces, which were towards
theaudience, with fansmade ofcrimson and gilt
paper which sparkled inthelight.
“Onourentrance theband struck up,andour
special attention was called totheorchestra, asthe
instruments areseldom seen intheMalay Peninsula.
There were twochief performers :oneplaying ona
sort ofharmonicon, thenotes ofwhich hestruck
with pieces ofstick held ineach hand. The other,
with similar pieces ofwood, played oninverted metal
bowls. Both these performers seemed tohave suffici-
ently hard work, butthey played with thegreatest
spirit from 10p.m. till5a.m.
“Theharmonicon iscalled byMalays chelempong,
andtheinverted bowls, which give apleasant and
musical sound likethenoise ofrippling water, agam-
bang .Theothermembers oftheorchestra consisted
ofavery small boywho played, with avery largeand
thick stick, onagigantic gong, anoldwoman who
beat adrum withtwo sticks, and several other boys
whoplayed oninstruments liketriangles called chanang.
All these performers, wewere told with much
solemnity, were artists ofthe first order, masters anda
mistress intheir craft,and ifvigour ofexecution counts
forexcellence theyproved thejustice ofthepraise.
“The Hall, ofconsiderable size,capable ofaccom-
modating several hundreds ofpeople, wasonlydimly
lighted, butthe fact that, while theaudience was in
semi-darkness, thelightwasconcentrated ontheper-
formers added tothe effect. Besides ourselves, I
question whether there weremore than twenty spec-
tators, but sitting onthetopofthedais, near tothe

regard tothefeelings oftheaudience.
“From theelaborate andvehement execution ofthe
players, andthewant ofregular time inthemusic, I
judged, and rightly, thatwehadentered astheover-
turebegan. During itsperformance thedancers sat
leaning forward, hiding their faces as Ihave described
;
butwhen itconcluded and, without anybreak, the
music changed intotheregular rhythm fordancing,
thefour girlsdropped their fans, raised theirhands in
theactofSembah orhomage, andthen began the
dance byswaying their bodies andslowly waving their
arms andhands inthemost graceful movements
making much and effective use allthewhile ofthe
scarf hanging from their belts. Gradually raising
themselves from asitting toakneeling posture, act-
ing inperfect accord inevery motion, then rising
totheir feet,they floated through aseries offigures
hardly tobeexceeded ingrace and difficulty, con-
sidering thatthemovements areessentially slow, the
arms, hands, andbody being the real performers,
whilst thefeetarescarcely noticed and forhalfthe
time notvisible.
“They danced fiveorsixdances, each lasting quite
halfanhour, with materially different figures andtime
inthemusic. Allthese dances, Iwas told,weresym-
bolical :oneofagriculture, with thetilling ofthe soil,
thesowing oftheseed, thereaping andwinnowing of
thegrain, might easily have been guessed from the
dancer’s movements. Butthose oftheaudience whom

able togivememuch information. Attendants stood

“The lastdance, symbolical ofwar,wasperhaps the
best, themusic being much faster, almost inspiriting,
andthemovements ofthedancers more freeandeven
abandoned. Forthelatter halfofthedance theyeach
held awand, torepresent asword, bound with three
rings ofburnished goldwhich glittered inthelight like
precious stones. This nautch, which began soberly like
theothers, grew toawild revel until thedancers were,
orpretended tobe,possessed bytheSpirit ofDancing,

amoment tosmear their fingers and faces with a
fragrant oil,they returned, andthetwo eldest, striking

ever, aftersome trouble, caught byfourorfivewomen
andcarried forcibly outoftheHall, butnotuntil their
captors hadbeenmade tofeeltheweight ofthemagic

toowould like tobe“possessed,” butdidnotknow
how toaccomplish it,were easily caught andremoved.
“The bands, whose strains hadbeen increasing in
wildness and intime, ceased playing ontheremoval of
thedancers, andthenautch, which hadbegun at10

The religious origin ofalmost allMalay dances is
stilltobeseen intheperformance ofsuch ritualistic
observances astheburning ofincense, thescattering
ofrice,andtheinvocation oftheDance-spirit accord-
ingtocertain setforms, thespirit being duly exorcised
again (or“escorted homewards,” asitiscalled) atthe
endoftheperformance.
Thedances which have best preserved theolder
ritual areprecisely those which aretheleast often seen,
such asthe “Gambor Dance ”
(main gambor), the
“Monkey Dance ”
(main b'rok),the “Palm-blossom
Dance” (main mayang), andthe“Fish-trap Dance”
(main Inkah). These Iwill take intheorder
mentioned.
The “Gambor Dance ”(lit.Gambor Play) should
beperformed bygirls justentering uponwomanhood.
ThecUbutante isattired inanattractive coatandskirt
(sarong), isgirtabout atthewaist with ayellow (royal)
sash,and isfurther provided with anelaborate head-
dress, crescent-shaped pendants (dokoh) forthebreast,

“Pleasure-garden” (taman bunga), which isrepre-
sented byalarge water-jar containing abunch oflong
sprays, from theends ofwhich aremade todepend
artificial flowers, fruit, and birds, thewhole being
intended toattract the spirit (Hantu Gambor). In
addition there istheusual circular tray, with itscom-

being ready, thedebutante liesdown and iscovered
over with asheet, andincense isburnt, the sacrificial
rice sprinkled, and theinvocation ofthe spirit is
chanted byawoman totheaccompaniment ofthe
tambourines. Ere ithasended, ifallgoes well, the
charm willhave begun towork, the spirit descends,
andthedance commences.
Attheendofthisdance, ashasalready been said,
thespirit isexorcised, that is,he is“escorted back”
totheseventh heaven fromwhence hecame.
The invocations, which areusedboth atthecom-
mencement andtheconclusion oftheperformance,
consist ofpoems which belong unmistakably tothe
“Panji”cycle ofstories;hereandthere they contain
oldwords which are stillused inJava.
The “Monkey Dance” isachieved bycausing the
“Monkey spirit”toenter intoagirlofsome tenyears
ofage. She isfirstrocked toand froinaMalay
infant’s swinging-cot(buayan\ andfedwith areca-nut
and salti^pinang garam). When she issufficiently
dizzy or“dazed ”
(mabok),aninvocation addressed
tothe “Monkey spirit”ischanted (totambourine
accompaniments), andatitsclose thechildcommences
toperform adance, inthecourse ofwhich she issaid
sometimes toachieve some extraordinary climbing
feats which shecould never have achieved unless
“possessed.” When itistime forhertorecover her
senses she iscalled uponbyname, and ifthat fails to
recall her, isbathed alloverwithcocoa-nut milk(ayer

aspecies ofiron spits, whose upper ends arefurnished
with hoops, uponwhich small ironrings arestrung, and
which accordingly giveoutajingling noisewhen shaken.
Two ofthese spits (buah dabus) arecharmed (to
deaden their bite), andtaken up,one ineach hand, by
thedancer, who shakes them ateach step thathe
takes. When heisproperly possessed, hedrives the
points ofthese spitsthrough themuscle ofeach fore-
arm,and letsthem hangdown whilst hetakes upa
second pair.Hethenkeeps allfour spits jingling at
once until thedance ceases. The point ofeach spit
goes right through themuscle, but ifskilfully done,
draws noblood .1
Wenowcome toaclass ofdances inwhich
certain inanimate objects, that arebelieved tobe
temporarily animated, aretheperformers, andwhich
therefore closely correspond totheperformances of
ourown spiritualists.
ThePalm-blossom dance isavery curious exhibi-
tion, which Ionce sawperformed intheLangat
District ofSelangor. Two freshly-gathered sheaves of
areca-palm blossom (each several feet inlength) were
deposited upon anewmat,near atraycontaining a
censer andthethree kinds ofsacrificial rice.

theperformance byplaying aprelude onhisviolin.

VI THEPALM-BLOSSOM DANCE 467
Presently hiswife (anaged Selangor woman) took
some oftherice inherhandandcommenced tochant
thewords oftheinvocation, shebeing almost immedi-
ately joined inthechant byayounger woman.
Starting with thewords, “Thus Ibrace up, Ibrace up
thePalm-blossom ”(’kuanggit mayang 'kuanggit),
their voices rosehigher andhigher until theseventh
stanza wasreached, when theoldwoman covered the
twosheaves ofPalm-blossom with aMalay plaid skirt
{sarong) andtheusual “five cubits ofwhite cloth”
(folded double), both ofwhich had ofcourse first
been fumigated. Then followed seven more stanzas
(“Borrow thehammer, Borrow the anvil,” and its
companion verses), and ricehaving been thrown over
oneofthesheaves ofpalm-blossom, itssheath was
opened andthecontents fumigated. Then theold
woman took thenewly-fumigated sheaf between her
hands, andthechant recommenced with the third
septet ofstanzas (“Dig up,digup,thewild ginger
plant ”),astheerect palm-blossom swayed from side
toside intime tothemusic. Finally thefiddle stopped
andtambourines were substituted, and atthispoint
thesheaf ofblossom commenced tojump about onits
stalk, asifitwere indeed possessed, andeventually
dashed itself upon theground. After one ortwo
repetitions ofthisperformance, other persons present
were invited totry it,anddidsowithvarying success,
which depended, Iwas told,upon theimpressionability
oftheir souls, asthepalm-blossom would notdance
foranybody whose soulwasnotimpressionable (lemah
semangat).
When the firstblossom-sheaf hadbeen destroyed
bytherough treatment which ithad toundergo, the
second was duly fumigated and introduced tothe

company, and finally theperformance wasbrought to
aclose bythechanting ofthestanzas inwhich the
spirit isrequested toreturn tohisown place. The
twospoiled sheaves ofblossom were then carried re-
spectfully outofthehouse and laidontheground
beneath abanana-tree.
TheDancing Fish-trap (main lukah)isaspiritual-
isticperformance, inwhich afish-trap(lukah)issub-
stituted forthesheaf ofpalm-blossom, andadifferent
invocation isused. Inother respects there isvery little
difference between thetwo. The fish-trap isdressed
upmuch inthesameway asa“scare-crow,” soasto

figure, i.e. itisdressed inawomans coatand plaid

beenworn previously;astick isrunthrough itto
serve asthearms ofthefigure, anda(sterile) cocoa-nut
shell(tempurong jantan)clapped onthetoptoserve
asahead. The invocation isthen chanted inthe
samemanner andtothesame accompaniment asthat
used forthe“Palm-blossom.” At itsconclusion the
magician whispers, sotospeak, intothefish-trap’s ear,
bidding it“nottodisgrace him,” butriseupanddance,
andthefish-trap presently commences torock toand fro,
andtoleapabout inamanner which ofcourse proves
ittobe“possessed” bythe spirit. Two different
specimens oftheinvocations used willbefound inthe
Appendix.

“The bulls have been trained andmedicined for
months beforehand, withmuch careful tending, many
strength-giving potions, andvolumes oftheold-world

place speedily becomes apandemonium, compared
withwhich theTower ofBabel wasaquiet corner in
Sleepy Hollow.
“Atlasttheword tobegin isgiven, andthekeepers
ofthebuffaloes letoutthelinesmade fasttothebulls’

drawn taut, sothat the bulls aresoon facing one

these fencing matches. Each beast gives way the

When atlastafirm griphasbeen won,andthehorn

thehighest level possible, and hismassive neck strains
andquivers with thetremendous effort. Ifthestab is
sufficiently lowdown, say intheneck orunder the
cheek-bone, thewounded bull isoften lifted clean off
hisfore-feet, andhangs there helpless andmotionless
‘while amanmight count ascore.’ The exertion of
lifting, however, istoogreat toadmit ofitsbeing

fights between animals, that areproperly conducted,
lesscruel thanone isapttoimagine.”2
Iwillnow pass tothesubject ofcock-fighting, of
which thefollowing vivid description isalsotaken from
Mr. Clifford’s InCourtandKampong .3
“IntheArchipelago, andontheWest Coast ofthe
Peninsula, cock-fights areconducted inthemanner
known totheMalays asber-taji,thebirds being armed
with long artificial spurs, sharp asrazors, andcurved

aninterest toacock-fight—qualities which areinno
wayrequired ifthebirds arearmed withweapons other
than those withwhich they arefurnished bynature.
“Acock-fight between twowell-known birds isa
serious affair inPahang. The rival qualities ofthe
combatants have furnished food forendless discussion
forweeks, oreven months, before, andevery oneof
standing hasvisited andexamined thecocks, andhas
made abook upon theevent. Onthedayfixed for
thefight acrowd collects before thepalace, andsome
oftheKing’s youths setupthecock-pit, which isa
ring, about three feet indiameter, enclosed bycanvas
walls, supported onstakes driven into theground.
Presently theJuara, orcock-fighters, appear, each
carrying hisbirdunder his leftarm. They enter the
cock-pit, squat down, andbegin pulling at,andsham-
pooing thelegsandwings oftheir birds, inthemanner
which Malays believe loosen themuscles, andgetthe
reefs outofthecocks’ limbs. Then theword isgiven
tostart thefight, andthebirds, released, flystraight
atoneanother, striking with their spurs, andsending
feathers flying inalldirections. This lasts forperhaps
three minutes, when thecocks begin tolosetheir wind,
andthefight iscarried onasmuch with theirbeaks as
with their spurs. Each bird tries toget itsheadunder
itsopponent’s wing, running forward tostrike atthe
back ofitsantagonist’s head, assoon as itsown
emerges from under itstemporary shelter. This is
varied byanoccasional blow with thespurs, andthe
Malays herald each stroke withloud cries ofapproval.
Basah !Bdsah !‘Thou hastwetted him !Thou hast
drawn blood!’ Ahitudia!iThat isit!That isa
good one !’Ahsakit-lah itu!‘Ah,thatwasanasty

efforts, amid occasional burst ofthe shrill chorus of
yells, called sorak, their backers cheering them on,and
crying tothembyname.
“Presently time iscalled, thewatch being asmall
section ofcocoa-nut inwhich ahole hasbeen bored,
that issetfloating onthesurface ofajarofwater,
until itgradually becomes filled and sinks. Atthe
word, each cock-fighter seizes hisbird, drenches it
with water, cleans outwithafeather thephlegm which
hascollected initsthroat, andshampoos itslegsand
body. Then, atthegiven word, thebirds areagain
released, andthey flyatoneanother withrenewed
energy. They lose their wind more speedily this
time, and thereafter they pursue the tactics already
described untiltime isagain called. When some ten
rounds have been fought, andboth thebirds are
beginning toshow signs ofdistress, theinterest ofthe
contest reaches itsheight, forthefight isatanend if
either bird raises itsback feathers inapeculiar manner,
bywhich cocks declare themselves tobevanquished.
Early inthetenth round theright eye-ball ofonecock
isbroken, and, shortly after, the lefteye isbunged up,
sothat forthetime itisblind. Nevertheless, it
refuses tothrow upthesponge, andfights ongallantly
totheendoftheround, taking terrible punishment,
anddoing but littleharm toitsopponent. Onecannot
butbefullofpityandadmiration forthebrave bird,
which thus gives somarvellous anexample ofits
pluck andendurance. Atlasttime iscalled, andthe
cock-fighter who isincharge oftheblinded bird, after
examining itcarefully, asks foraneedle andthread,
andtheswollen lower lidofthe stilluninjured eye-ball
issewn tothepiece ofmembrane onthebird’s cheek,
and itssight isthus once more partially restored.


478 DANCES, SPORTS, ANDGAMES CHAP.
Again time iscalled, andthebirds resume their con-
test, thecock with the injured eye repaying its
adversary sohandsomely forthepunishment which it
hadreceived intheprevious round, that, before the
cocoa-nut shell ishalf fullofwater, itsopponent has
surrendered, andhasimmediately been snatched up
bythekeeper incharge of it.The victorious bird,
draggled andwoebegone, with great patches ofred
flesh showing through itswetplumage, with the
membrane ofitsfaceand itsshort gillsandcomb
swollen andbloody, withoneeyeput out,andthe
other only keptopen bythethread attached toits
eyelid, yetmakes shift tostrut, with staggering gait,
across thecock-pit, andtonotify itsvictory bygiving
vent toalamentable ghost ofacrow. Then itis
carried offfollowed byanadmiring, gesticulating,
vociferous crowd, tobeelaborately tended andnursed,
asbefits sogallant abird. The beauty ofthe
sport isthat either bird canstop fighting atany
moment. They arenever forced tocontinue the
conflict ifonce theyhave declared themselves defeated,
andtheonly realelement ofcruelty isthusremoved.
The birds infighting follow theinstinct which nature
hasimplanted inthem, and their marvellous courage
andendurance surpass anything tobefound inany
other animals, human orotherwise, withwhich Iam
acquainted. Most birds fightmore orless—from the
little fierce quail tothesucking doves which ignorant
Europeans, before their illusions have been dispelled
byasojourn intheEast, areaccustomed toregard as
theemblems ofpeace and purity;butnobird, or
beast, orfish, orhuman being fights sowell, ortakes
such pleasure inthefierce joyofbattle, asdoesaplucky,
lanky, ugly, hard-bit oldfighting-cock.


VI WESTCOAST CUSTOMS 479
“TheMalays regard these birds withimmense
respect, andvalue their fighting-cocks next totheir
children. Afewyears ago, aboy,whowas incharge
ofacockwhich belonged toaRaja ofmyacquaintance,
accidentally pulled some feathers from thebird’s tail.
‘What didyoudothat for ?Devil !’cried the
Raja.
“‘Itwasnotdone onpurpose, Ungku /’saidthe
boy.
“‘Thou artmarvellous clever atrepartee !’quoth
thePrince, and,sosaying, helifted abillet ofwood,
which chanced tobelying near athand, andsmote the
boyonthehead sothathedied.
“‘That willteachmypeople tohave acarehow
theyusemyfighting-cocks !’saidtheRaja;and that
was hisservant’s epitaph.
“‘Itisamere boyish prank,’ saidthefather ofthe
young Raja,when thematter wasreported tohim,
‘and,moreover, itiswell thatheshould slayoneor
twowith hisownhand, elsehow should men learn to
fearhim ?’And there thematter ended;but itshould
beborne inmind that thefighting-cock ofaMalay
Prince isnottobelightly trifled with.”
Oftheform ofcock-fighting practised ontheWest
Coast ofthePeninsula Newbold writes :—
“Thefollowing isaspecimen from aMalay MS.
onthe subject, commencing with remarks onthe
various breeds ofthisnoble bird:—

observe that theMalays generally useone spur;
though twospurs aresometimes given tomatch a

“Ionce witnessed agrand contest between two
Malayan States atthebreaking upoftheRamazan
fast. Most ofthecock-fighters presented themselves
attheGolongan orcock-pit with agame-cock under
each arm. The birdswere nottrimmed asinEng-
land, butfought infullfeather. The spurs usedon
thisoccasion were about twoandahalfinches long, in
shape liketheblade ofascythe, andwere sharpened
onthespotbymeans ofafinewhetstone;large gashes
were inflicted bythese murderous instruments, and it
rarely happened thatboth cocks survived the battle.
Cocks ofthesame colour areseldom matched. The
weight isadjusted bythesetters-to passing them to
andfrom each other’s hands asthey sitfacing each
other intheGolongan. Should there beany differ-
ence, itisbrought down toanequality bythespur
being fixed somany scales higher onthelegofthe
heavier cock, oraccording torules adverted to,as
deemed fairbyboth parties. One spur only isused,
and isgenerally fastened near thenatural spuronthe
inside ofthe leftleg. Inadjusting these preliminaries

“Gambling ofvarious descriptions, both with dice
andwith cards, ismuch invogue. These, aswell as
thepoe-table, have been introduced bytheChinese,
who areeven greater adepts than theMalays inall
that relates tothispernicious vice.

“Thegames played bychildren areTujoh Lobang,2

Of allminor games, top-spinning and kite-flying
areperhaps themost popular. The kites arecalled
layang-layang,which means a“swallow,” butare
sometimes ofgreat size,onewhich wasbrought to

thatno“tail” isrequired, thekitebeing steadied by
means ofabeak which projects forward atthetop

with athin, horizontal slip ofbamboo(dengong)

Children's Games
Iwillnowgivesome specimens ofthegames I
have seenplayed bychildren:—
“Throwing theFlower across” (champak bunga
sa-Ulah) isagame which Ihave seen thus played by
boys.
Ahandkerchief wastwisted up(like arope) from
corner tocorner, folded inhalf,andthen tiedtogether
attheends.
Two couples stood facing oneanother atafew
yards’ distance, and atagiven signal oneoftheboys
ineach couple took hiscompanion upontohisshould-
ers.Thetwowhoweremounted threw thehandker-
chief across toeach other, andback again byturns.
When theone failed tocatch it,both riders dis-
mounted andoffered backs totheir late“mounts,” who
thusbecame riders, andthrew thehandkerchief in
their turn. Each time, however, that acatch was
made both parties crossed over. When three catches
were made inunbroken succession(kelerik)the
riders hadtheprivilege ofbeing carried across three
times before recommencing play.
Ishould addthatacoinwastossed upattheout-
setofthegame todecide whowere tostart asthe
riders, andwhowere tobetheridden.
Main Sesel (orKachau kueJi) bears astrong
family resemblance toourown“Hen andchickens.”
When Iwitnessed it,abigboyplayed the “Pater-
familias”with astring ofchildren athisback, each of
whom washolding ontotheone infront ofhim.
Presently a“Cakeseller ”presented himself, andthe
following conversation ensued:—


VI CHILDREN’S GAMES 495
Paterfamilias :Adakueh ?(Have youanycake ?)
Cakeseller :Ada. (Ihave.)
P.F. :Buleh akuEli? (Can Ibuysome ?)
C. :Buleh. (Yes.)
Here theCakeseller hands aballofearth toPater-
familias, whopasses itdown thelineofchildren tothe
youngest child attheendoftherow. The conversa-
tionthenrecommenced—
Cakeseller :Akumintd duit. (Iwantmymoney.)
P.F. :Duit fada, anak kunchi tinggal dijamban. (Ihave got
nomoney, Ihave mislaid thekey.) Kalau mahu ambil budak,
ambilyang di-b’lakang. (Ifyouwish totakeoneofmychildren,
take the last.)
Here adesperate effortwasmade bythepoorCake-
seller tododge past Paterfamilias andget attheboy,
whom heeventually succeeded incarrying off.
Main Tul isagame somewhat resembling our
own “Puss inthecorner,” butwith onlyone“home.”
The“home”consisted ofastake planted upright, and
the first “Puss”(prang tul)wasselected byaspecies
ofdivination depending upon repetition ofthesame
formula asisused toselect theblindman inBlind
Man’s Buff(Main China Buta). There was(as Ihave
said) onlyonehome inthisgame, from which the
players sallied forth totaunt theorang tul
,and
which theywere obliged totouch inorder tosave
themselves when closely pursued.
Main Seladang (Wild Bullgame) isanexcellent
game forchildren with theshoeless feetoftheEast.
A“wild bull”having been selected byrepetition of
thePing hilang formula, went upon allfours, and
entered intothefollowing conversation between him-
selfandoneoftheother players specially selected for
thepurpose. The latter opened negotiations with the
clearly non-committal, ifnotvery lucid remark, “Tam

tamkul towhich the“Bull”replied, “Buat apaguna
bakul ”(What areyougoing todowithyour basket?)
Boy :Mengisi arang. (Tohold charcoal.)
Bull :Buat apagunaarang ?(What willyoudowith thechar-
eoal?)
Boy :Menempa (ormasak) lembing. (Ishall forge aspear.)
Bull :Buat apaguna lembing ?(What usewillyoumake of
thespear?)
Boy :Menikam seladang. (Tostababull with.)
Bull (who isgetting excited) :Buat apaguna di-tikam ?(What
usewill itbetostabhim ?)
Boy :Mengambil hati-nya. (Togethisheart.)
Bull (who isnow fairly savage) :Buat apaguna hati-nya ?
(What usewillyoumake ofhisheart ?)
Boy :Buat santap RajaMuda. (Get theCrown Prince topar-
take (ofit).)
The Bull attheendofthisbaiting wasready to
“charge”anybody andeverything, anddidaccordingly
runattherestoftheplayers, kicking outwith allhis
might atanybody whocame near. Ashehad to
move onallfours hecould notgovery fast,andthe
other players took advantage ofthis tobaithim still
further byslapping himonthebackandjumping over
him. Whenever theycame nearenough helashed
outwith hisheels, andwhen hesucceeded inkicking
another player below theknee, the latter became a
Bull inhisturn. Much agility isdisplayed inthis
game, which isthoroughly enjoyed bytheplayers.
“Blind Man’s Buff” (Main China Buta,or“Blind
Chinaman ”)isplayed inexactly thesamemanner as
ourown Blind Man’s Buff; oneoftheparty, with
bandaged eyes, being required tocatch anyonewho
comes nearhim.
The firstblindman—atthecommencement ofthe
game—ischosen asfollows: theintending players
sitdown together inaclose circle, each ofthem
putting down the tips oftheir forefingers inthe


VI NURSERY RHYMES 497
centre ofthe circle;then somebody who isnot
playing tapseach ofthem onthehead inturn, re-
peating ateach tapaword ofthefollowing formula:—

disappear.
Themeaning ofthisformula (as isthecasewith
somany “nursery” rhymes) isvery obscure, several
words being unintelligible oratleast doubtful. Itis,
however, theregular formula used forsuchgames and
isquitecommon.1
Chan chan sikurembat isagame which Isaw
played inSelangor asfollows:—
The intending players stood inarow, looking
straight infront ofthem, butwith their hands behind
their backs, whilst another boy,whohadapiece of

10.THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS
TheMalay Drama, taking theword initswidest
sense ascomprising every kind oftheatrical exhibition,
includes performances ofseveral different types, which
derive their origin from various distinct sources. Most
ofthem bearsome traces oftheir foreign extraction,
andthough theyhave beenmuch modified bythe
Malays, and arenow quite “naturalised”inthe
Peninsula, itispretty clear thatthegreater parthave
been borrowed from India, Siam, China, andpossibly
other countries. Itisnoteworthy thatmany, perhaps
most, oftheplots represented inthese performances


504 THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS CHAP.
owe their origin totheoldclassical Indian Epics, and
especially tothestory oftheRamayana, which hasbeen
handed down traditionally, much modified bylocal
colouring, inJavaandSiam aswell asintheMalay
Peninsula.
Itisnotwithin thescope ofthiswork togiveany-
thing likeafulldescription ofthese different kinds of
dramatic representations, but itisdesirable togive
some account ofthe ritual which accompanies them,
andtheideas and superstitions which theyseem to
involve.
Themost important oftheceremonies which relate
totheMalay theatre isthatofinaugurating or“open-
ing”(as itiscalled) asitefortheperformance. The
following isanaccount (byMr.Hugh Clifford) ofthe
performance ofthisceremony:—
“When oneofthese companies arrives ataplace
where itintends to‘open,’ iterects asmall, square
shed, open atallfour sides, butcarefully roofed in,and
withahand-rail running round itabout two feetfrom
theground. This shed iscalled aBangsal, andthe
space which itssides enclose istermed Panggong. Be-
foretheplay begins, theceremony called Buka Pang-
gong *,which has for itsobject theinvocation and
propitiation ofcertain spirits, isgone through. . . .
“Theceremony, which isacurious one, isper-
formed inthefollowing manner :Thecompany having
entered theshed andtaken their seats, abrazier is
placed infront ofthePawang;orMedicine- Man,who
isalsothehead ofthetheatrical troop. Inthisbrazier
precious woods and spices areburned, andwhile the
incense ascends, thePdwang intones thefollowing
incantation, theothermembers ofthetroop repeating
eachsentence inchorus asheconcludes it.

supposed tocontain, andthen arises andbegins toact
hispart.”1
Asimilar ceremony waswitnessed in1897byMr.
Everard Fielding andthepresent writer attheback
oftheBungalow atJugra (inSelangor). The object
oftheceremony was todrive away evil spirits from
thespotwhere theperformance was totake place,
and theperformers were alittle band ofplayers
from Penang who had settled intheneighbour-
hood andhadplanted their holdings with Liberian
coffee.
ThePawang ormagician inthisinstance wasa
Malay named ’Che Hussein, whoacted asclown, and
subsequently wrote out atmyrequest rough tran-
scripts ofmore thanadozen oftheplays acted byhis
company.
Abigmat ormats having been laidupon the
ground inaspot carefully selected forthepurpose, four
corner posts were planted andabigawning orceiling-
cloth(langit-langit)stretched between them. The
square space between thepostswasthenfenced offby
carrying acouple ofcords round ithorizontally from
post topost,one attheheight oftwo,andtheother
about five feetabove theground. From these cords
were suspended various ornamental objects made of
plaited strips ofcocoa-nut leaf,fashioned intorough
resemblances ofanimals, birds, fruitandflowers, afew
bananas being added atintervals, these latter serving
aslight refreshments fortheplayers whenever they
feltsominded. Stems ofbanana trees with their
leaves fastened ateach postmade thestructure com-
plete, andthegeneral effect, enhanced bythebright

daggers, andother “properties”ofthecompany, until
theywere wellfumigated. Henext lighted three tapers,

kinds, andvary considerably indifferent places. The
Joget, akind ofdramatic andsymbolical dance, has
been described under thehead ofDances. The
Mdyong isatheatrical performance which includes
both dancing (orposturing asEuropeans would be
tempted tocall it)and singing. It isgenerally
performed bytravelling companies ofprofessional
actors and actresses, whogoontourandperform
either atthehouses ofRajas orother persons of
some social standing, orbefore thegeneral public in
some public place .1
Just asthedances oftheJoget
aresupposed tobesymbolical ofdifferent actions
andideas, andareaccompanied byappropriate music,
sointheMdyong there isquite along listoftunes,
each ofwhich isconsidered tobeappropriate toa
particular action, ortosome one ormore ofthe
dramatis persona. Infact,onemay almost saythat
wehave here, inprinciple, therudegerm ofthe
Wagnerian Leitmotif. Thus when one ofthe
performers issupposed tobesent tosleep, theLagu
Legor Radin istheoneused;intherepresentation
ofadeath, theLaguMerayu;
when acharacter is
supposed tobeentering thejungle, theLaguSamsam ;
when anyone sitsdown, theLagu Patani Tuah.
Similarly theLaguPuyuh,theLaguDang Dondang

ofthestock characters ofthis species ofplay, while
other tunes canbeused onlybythePrincess andthe

again, areemployed indifferently toaccompany anyof
theparts, whether prince, princess, clown (P’ran), or

514 THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS CHAP.
The costumes oftheperformers inthevarious
kinds ofdramatic exhibitions vary, ofcourse, with the
subject-matter oftherepresentation. The clown’s
masks andtheforest demon (hantu hutan), ofwhich
illustrations aregiven, will serve asspecimens to
indicate thenature ofsome oftheaccessories inuse.
Afairly full listoftheirMalay names willbefound
intheclassification given below.
TheMayong isperhaps themost typical form of
Malay theatrical representations, butanother very
characteristic performance istheShadow- Play, pro-
perly termed Wayang, aname thathasbeen loosely
extended tocover theatrical exhibitions ingeneral.
“The show iscalled Wayang Kulit,orleather
puppets. Itisexhibited inarough shed, which has
aflooring raised about three feetfrom theground
;
thebuilding isusually twenty feetsquare andenclosed
onthree sides, thefront alone being open;across
thisopening awhite sheet isstretched onwhich the
shadows ofthepuppets arethrown andseen through
bytheaudience;thelatter sitorstand intheopen
air.
“The show seems tobeofHindu origin, ifwe
mayjudge from thestrong resemblance thefigures
bear totherepresentations ofgods andgoddesses
worshipped bytheHindus ofIndia; itisprobably
obtained from Java.
“The figures aremade ofbuffalo hide, andthe
arms alone aremovable;they aremoved byslips of
wood attached tothem, which arevery clumsily
contrived, and astheir shadows areseen with
thepuppets the effect isvery much destroyed.
Various scenes ofadomestic nature areexhibited,
andthey take theshape ofaplay, butwithnodefinite

plot running through orconnecting the different
scenes.
“Thefollowing isaspecimen:—
“An oldmanappears weeping foralong-lost son,
andmoves toand froforsome time bewailing his
loss;theshowman speaks each figure’s part, and
alters thetone ofhisvoice tosuittheageofthe
speaker;asecond figure comes on,representing a
young manarmed with akrisywhoendeavours to
pick aquarrel with the firstcomer, andtheconver-
sation iswitty and characteristic, eliciting roars of
laughter from thelookers-on;afight ensues, andthe
oldman iswounded;hefallsand cries outthatwere
heayoung man, orifhislostsonwere present, his
adversary should notthustriumph over him. Inhis
conversation hehappens tomention hisson’sname
;
theyoung man intimates that hisname isthesame,
anexplanation ensues, and itends bytheoldman
discovering inhislateadversary hislong-lost son.
The oldfellow weeps andlaughs alternately, caresses
hissonfrequently, anddeclares they shall never part
again;thescene endsbytheyouth shedding tears
over hislateinhuman conduct, andhefinally walks
offwith theoldgentleman onhisback.
“The conversation iscarried onsolely inthe
Malayan dialect. Warlike scenes please most :a
warrior comes onthestage and challenges hisin-
visible enemy tomortal combat;suddenly another
figure comes onattheopposite sideandadesperate
fight ensues, which lasts foraverylong time, andends
inoneofthecombatants being killed. Occasionally
abattle inwhich tenortwelve figures jointakes place,
and forhours willtheMalays lookonatsuch scenes.
“Theshow concludes withanexhibition ofvarious

animals—deer, horses, tigers, crocodiles, etc., also
birds and fishes. The figures areperforated to
represent theeyes, shape ofthedress, etc.
“Attheback oftheshed, concealed bythesheet,
sitthemusicians, whokeep upanincessant dinon
drums andcymbals.”1
Thepuppets forthese shadow-plays areusually cut
outofdeer-skin (not buffalo hide) and itisworth re-
marking thatthey are allconsidered tobemore or
lessanimated;astringent propitiatory ceremony hasto
beperformed intheir honour, incense being burnt and
ricescattered about, just asintheMayong ceremony
already described.
Thepresent writer, while inSelangor, bought from
aKelantan Malay named ’Che ‘Abas, aperformer of
shadow-plays, hisentire stock-in-trade, including not
only hismusical instruments (amongst which were
some curious drums called geduandgedombak butalso
hiscandle (with itsshade), thericeused forthecere-
mony, and hisentire stock ofshadow-pictures, allof
which arenow intheCambridge Museum.
Thefollowing classification ofthemore important
kinds oftheatrical performances, which wasdrawn up
forthepresent writer by’CheHussein ofPenang, the
actor ofwhom mention hasalready beenmade,maybe
ofinterest, andwillserve toindicate briefly their several
characteristic features, though itdoesnotprofess tobe
absolutely exhaustive:—

Suchcharms asmight beused intime ofwar, or
incaseofdanger from wild beasts orother enemies,
arepartly whatmaybecalled “defensive”andpartly
“offensive”incharacter.
TheMalays whousethem pray, ontheonehand,
forasupernatural appearance wherewith toscare their
enemies andprotect themselves, andontheother for
supernatural powers toassist inthedestruction oftheir
foes.
Thus, oneoftheircharms runs:—
“LetmefacetheSeven Suns,
But letnotmyenemies faceme.
Ha !IamaTiger andthou artaDog.”1
Theuseofsuchcharms issupplemented invarious
ways :thusachampion(penglima)willsometimes draw
aline infront ofhim,which hebelieves hisenemy will
beunable topass;2this isdonebysimply scraping the
ground with theright footandthreatening thefoe
with adirecurse ifheattempts tocross it.
“Pushandyou die,stepacross andyour legshall break.
Iapply thecharm oftheLine called theSwollen Corpse.”
According toanother method ofgaining martial
vigour andimmunity infighting, youtake awick as
long astheshort span between yourthumb and first
finger(sa-jengkal telunjok),and after passing itover
yourbodyupwards(di-naikkan)thrice, take itbetween
yourtwohands and tryandturn itround while you
repeat thecharm. Theceremony must take place at

ifyousucceed you will(according totheMalay account)
seethevision ofaman, asign, itistobesupposed,
thatthecharm hasbeen effectual, and thattheprayer
hasbeen heard.
Thecharm begins asfollows:—
“Inthename ofGod, themerciful, thecompassionate !
May thisnerve ofstone pierce stone,
Pierce stone and split stone,
Pierce planks andgoright through them,
Pierce water anddry itup,
Pierce theearthandmake ahole init,
Pierce thegrassandwither it,
Pierce mountains andcause them tofall,
Pierce theheavens thattheymay fall,” etc.
Thecharm concludes with thefollowing magnificent
boast:—
“OfIronam I,andofCopper ismyframe,
Andmyname is‘Tiger ofGod.’”
Inasomewhat similar charm, awarrior prays that
hemaybe
“Fenced with Hell-fire uptotheeyes;”
andanother expresses thewish that hisenemies may
be
“Ground topowder liketin-ore after washing.”
Inactual warfare anumber ofrules arelaiddown,
theobservance ofwhich issupposed tobenecessary in
order toachieve success. As inseveral other pur-
suits,1there is,ofcourse, a“taboo”language ofwar
(bhasa pantang pWang),ofwhich thefollowing are
examples:—

Ballofswivel-gun {peluru lela)=kumbang hitam (lit.black beetle).
Stockade(kubu)=batang melintang (lit.transverse trunk), orbalei

When aman isout inthewars hispillows and
sleeping-mat athome have tobekept rolled up. If
anyone elsewere tousethem theabsent warrior’s
courage would fail,and disaster would befall him (ter-

have their haircut (tabulehpotong rambut atau beran-

chastity mustbeobserved inastockade, orthebullets
ofthegarrison will lose theirpower(peluru jinak di
kubu-nya),and itisalsoforbidden toabuse ormock
attheenemy, oreven attheirweapons .1
Bullets arefrequently, ifnotalways, “charmed”
before being used, andtheir efficacy issupposed tobe
increased thereby. TheOrang Kaya Pahlawan, a
chief ofsome local notoriety inrecent times, claimed to
beinvulnerable(kebal)
totheextent thatnothing but
asilver bullet would hurthim.
Thefollowing legendary tale illustrates asomewhat
similar idea:—The assailant, oneMagat Terawis, an
unknown warrior whohadjoined theSultan’s investing
army, hadfour bullets, oneach ofwhich were inscribed
thewords :“This isthesonoftheconcubine ofthe
Raja ofPagar-ruyong;hisname isMagat Terawis;
wherever hisbullet fallshewillbecome aChief.”

isattached, aswillappear from thefollowing passage
extracted from Newbold’s British Settlements inthe
Straits ofMalacca :—
“Translation ofMalayan MS. onKrises andProcess of
Damasking
“Fasl I.—OnthePamur, orDamasking ofKrises
“Ifthedamasking ofakrisonly reach within a
finger’s breadth ofthepoint, and ifitreach theedge,
itisinauspicious forcombat. Should thedamask not
beeven with thepoint, astabmade with such akris
would err;but ifeven, thenthekris willnever deviate,
although itspossessor losestrength tothrust;still,by
thegrace ofGod, itwillhitthemark should hecast it
athisadversary. Ifitbedamasked onboth sides, it
isgood;butnotsoshould thedamask beseparated at
intervals.
“Ifthedamask onthepoint bethat ofAlif besar

Alif), thekris isgood forcombat;but itisnotlucky
towear such aweapon while trading, norone inwhich
thedamask runs from thepangkal (thestem which

“Ifitpossess theAlifdamask near thehandle,

“How todamask krises.—Place ontheblade a
mixture ofboiled rice, sulphur, and saltbeat together,
firsttaking theprecaution tocover theedges ofthe

remained onseven days, thedamask willhave risen to

“Fasl IV.—Measurement ofKrises
“Measure thekriswith astring below itsaring (a
jutting outoftheblade near itsbottom) toitspoint;

blade ofthekris,thenmake amarkhow farthestring
reaches. Measure theblade across atthismark, and
findhowmany times itsbreadth iscontained intwo-
thirds ofitslength;cutthestring intoasmany pieces.
These form the sloca, ormeasure, ofwhich thekris
consists. Ifnone ofthestring remain over, theblade is
perfect, ifaminute portion remain, itislessperfect, but if
halfthebreadth remain, ormore, itischelaka,unlucky.”
Newbold adds:—
“The krises most preferred arethose ofthekinds
termed Simpana, Cherita, and Sapokal. The kris
panjang isworn generally bytheMalayan aristocracy
andbridegrooms. Ihave seensome beautiful speci-
mens ofthisweapon inRumbowe, worn bythechiefs
ofthat state. The blades resembled that ofalong,
keen poniard ofDamascus steel;thehandles of
ebony, covered with flowered gold, andsheaths richly
ornamented with thesame metal;theyareused inthe
execution ofcriminals. Malays donotprize their
krises entirely bythequantity ofgoldwithwhich they
maybeinlaid, butmore fortheir accurate proportions
agreeably tothemeasurement which islaiddown in
their treatises onthissubject; thedamask ontheblade;
theantiquity andacertain lucky quality thattheymay
possess either from accurate proportions, thedamask,
thehaving shedhuman blood, orfrom supernatural
endowment, likethefamous sword “Excalibur.” This
property istermed betuah,which signifies literally
exempt from accident, invulnerable. The reverse is
termed chelaka,ill-omened. They believe the
betuah insome cases imparts invulnerability tothe
possessor ofsuch akris,which ishanded down asan
heirloom from father toson,andhonoured assome-
thing divine. The kris is,aswith theJavanese, an

indispensable article indress onparticular occasions,
and there arenumerous regulations regarding the
wearing of it.TheUndang Undang Malacca1con-
tains strict injunctions, which areobserved tothisday,
against aperson ofinferior birth wearing akrisorna-
mented withgold.”2
Besides themode above described, several other
methods ofmeasuring thekris arealso invogue.
They differ invarious matters ofdetail, and willbe
found intheAppendix.
Themeasurement ofone-edged weapons iseffected
asfollows:—
Measure thelength oftheweapon from hiltto
point, andfoldthestring someasured intwo. Measure
offthis half-length from the hiltandseehow often
thebreadth oftheblade iscontained inthewhole
length ofthe string. Each time, however, that the
edge isreached, thestring must bemarked ordented,
andthelongendwrapped round andround theblade,
sothatthemeasurement ofeachbreadth isconsecutive to
thepreceding breadth, theportion ofthestring which is
stretched across theback oftheblade notbeing counted.
Thismethod iscalled ukormata sa-Ulah,and is
usedbySumatran Malays, especially inMenangkabau.
Spearheads canalsobemeasured:—
1TheCode ofSultanMahmud Shah,
the lastMalay Raja ofMalacca, who
wasexpelled bythePortuguese under
Alboquerque inA.D. IS11 *
ThisCode wasprobably founded on
earlier regulations ascribed toSultan
Muhammad Shah, the firstMuhamma-
danRaja ofMalacca, andSultan Mud-
hafar Shah, hisson. Nothing isknown
about thelaws ofthe lastnamed, ex-
cept that (according totheSejarah
Malayu,chap, xii.),“he ordered the
Book ofInstitutes, orKitab Undang-Undang,tobecompiled,” butthepre-
ceding chapter ofthesame work has
agood deal tosayabout thelaws of
SultanMuhammad Shah, andmentions
thathe“prohibited theornamenting
ofcreeses with gold, etc.”SeeLeyden,
op.cit.,pp.94,118.
Asimilar prohibition occurs insec-
tion i.ofSultan Mahmud’s Code, of
which atranslation willbefound in
Newbold, Malacca, vol. ii.pp.231 seq.

Measure offthelength ofthespearhead andfold
thestring intwo;seehow often thebreadth iscon-
tained inthehalfofthestring;iftheblade isagood
one, itmust befiveandahalftimes(tengah anam).
This iscalled ukororang Perak orukor tengah anam.
Another superstition connected withweapons is
described asfollows bySirFrank Swettenham. It
illustrates themagic powers attributed tothePawang
insomany departments ofnature and life,butdoes
notseem tohaveanyspecial object ormeaning.
“Agreatmany Malays andoneortwoEuropeans
maybefoundwho profess tohave seenwater drawn
from akris. Themodus operandi issimple. The
pawang (Idarenot callhimconjurer) works withbare
arms toshow there isnodeception. Hetakes the
kris (yours, ifyouprefer it)from itswooden handle,
and, holding the steel point downwards inhis left
hand, herecites ashort incantation totheeffect that
heknows allabout iron,andwhere itcomes from, and
that itmustobey hisorders. Hethenwiththethumb
and firsttwo fingers ofhisright hand proceeds to
gently squeeze the steel, moving hisfingers upand
down theblade. After alittle while afewdrops of
water fallfrom thepoint ofthekris,andthese drops
quickly develop intoastream that will fillacup.The
pawang willthenhand round theblade and tellyouto
bend it;thisyou willfindnodifficulty indoing, butby
making twoorthree passes over thekristhepawang
canrender itagain sohard that itcannot bebent.
“Theonlydrawback tothistrick ormiracle isthat
theprocess ruins thetemper ofthe steel, andakris
thathasbeen thus treated isuseless.”1

oftheothers, has lost itsformer importance, andbe-
come almost amatter ofmerely historical interest. In
theMalay Peninsula, atleast intheStates which are
under British protection, offensive weapons areseldom
worn now-a-days except onState occasions and for
purely ceremonial purposes;and warfare, itmaybe
hoped, isnowathing ofthepast. Inspite ofthehalo
ofromance thrown round itinnative writings, Malay
warfare (inmodern times, atleast) hasnever been
anything butthebarest andmost bloodthirsty piracy
bysea,andthemerest “bushwhacking” andstockade-
fighting onland;itsfinal suppression, even ifinsome
degree itshould involve aslackening offibre inthe
Malay character, isnotamatter forregret. With it
willdisappear much ofthecurious lorethatsurrounded
it,andindeed agood deal of itmust havebeen lost
already. Little hasbeen saidhere ofthemethods of
divination used inwarfare which takeupsomuch
space inMalay treatises onthesubject;success in
war isheld todepend onagreat number ofminute
observances, and tobecapable ofbeing foretold by
careful attention toomens andsigns. Butthedivina-
tionapplied inwarfare does notseem todiffer inprin-
ciplefrom thatwhich isused inalltheother avocations
oflife,andasufficient ideaofitsnature willbegathered
from theaccount given inthenext section.

fulljustice within thenarrow limits ofthisbook.My
object willbemerely toindicate themain lines on
which these twoimportant doctrines oftheMalay
natural religion appear tohavebeen developed.
Briefly, then,omens maybedrawn either from the
actsofmen ortheevents ofnature. Examples ofthe
ominous import attributed totheactsofman willat
once suggest themselves. Thus sneezing issaid tobe
fortunate astending todrive away thedemons of
disease;1yawning isabad sign, forobvious reasons,
ifthebreath isloudly emitted, but ifaquietyawn
occurs when thestomach iscraving forfood, itimports
that itwillsoonbefilled. Sotoostumbling isabad

tosetoutonajourney .2Then, again, “tobelong in

means thattheperson, ifunmarried, willmeet witha
badreception from hisorherparents-in-law hereafter.
The Malay saying inthevernacular is‘Lambat

Clothes which have been nibbled byrats ormice

misfortune, andaregenerally given away incharity.

Achild seen doing this isinstantly rebuked and

“The evileye isdreaded byMalays. Notonly
areparticular people supposed tobepossessed ofa
quality which causes ill-luck toaccompany their glance
(themal ’occhio ofthe Italians), buttheinfluence of
theevileye isoften supposed toaffect children, who
aretaken notice ofbypeople kindly disposed towards
them. For instance, itisunlucky toremark onthe
fatness and healthiness ofababy, andaMalay will
employ some purely nonsensical word, orconvey his

possible misfortune byusing theactual word‘fat.’

andasnake, areperhaps themost dreaded ofthese
unnatural visitors. They aresprinkled with ashes, if
possible, tocounteract their evilinfluence.
“Aswarm ofbees settling near ahouse isanun-
lucky omen, andprognosticates misfortune.”1
So,too,omens aretaken either from the flight or
cries ofcertain birds, such asthenight-owl, thecrow,
some kinds ofwild doves, and thebird called the
“Rice’s Husband” (lakipadi).
Passing from theideaofmereomens drawn from
fortuitous events weeasily arrive attheidea ofacon-
scious attempt onthepartoftheworshipper toascertain
thedivine pleasure with respect toasacrifice newly
offered. This effort oftheworshippers becomes
crystallised intime intoasub-rite, which yetforms
anintegral portion ofmost, ifnot all,ofthemore im-
portant ceremonies,2and eventually develops into a
special andseparate rite called Tilek (divination), of
which examples willnowbegiven.
Oneform ofthis ritewastaught byaMalay of
Penang extraction, whose instructions, takendown by
meatthetime, ranasfollows:—
Take alemon (liman purut),ahen’s egg, ataper

birches, oneofwhich mustbecomposed ofseven, and
theother oftwelve, leaf-ribs ofthe“green”cocoa-nut

Two ofthebananas, two cigarettes, twochews of
“betel,” halfofeach ofthethree kinds ofrice,the
egg,andthebirch ofseven twigs, mustnowbetaken
outside thehouse and setdown under atreeselected
forthepurpose. When setting itdown theeggmust
becracked, thecigarettes lighted, and finally thetaper
also. Ononeoccasion when Iwitnessed theper-
formance, thetaper, afterbeing taken upbetween the
outstretched fingers ofmyfriends twohands, was
waved slowly toand fro—first totherightandthen to
the left;finally itwas setdown ontheground and
began toburn blue, theflame becoming more and
moredim until italmost expired. Onseeing thisthe
medicine-man exclaimed, “He haspromised” (dia
mengaku),and ledthewayback tothehouse, where
heproceeded togothrough theremainder ofthe
ceremony.
First, hedeposited thebrazier with incense upon
theleafofabanana-tree, thentook theprickle ofthe
fishandthrust ithorizontally through thelower endof
thelemon, leaving bothendsexposed;thenhethrust
theneedle through inatransverse direction, soasto
form across, theends oftheneedle being likewise ex-
posed, andslipped thenoosed endofapiece ofsilken
thread ofseven different colours over thepoints thus
exposed.


VI TILEK 537
Next hescattered the riceround thecenser and
fumigated thebirch andthelemon, recited acharm
asheheld the latter inhisright hand, recited the
charm forthesecond time1ashetook thebirch in
both hands, with theupper end close tohismouth
andthelower (spreading) endover thebrazier, and
finally repeated thecharm forathird time, suspending,
ashedid so,thelemon over thebrazier bymeans of
thethread held inhislefthand andholding thebirch
intheright.
Everything being ready, henowbegan toput
questions tothelemon intowhich the spiritwassup-
posed tohave entered, rebuking itandthreatening it
with thebirchwhenever itfailed toanswer distinctly
and tothe point. The conversational powers of
this spirit were extremely limited, being confined
totwo signs signifying “Yes” and“No.” The
affirmative was indicated byapendulum -like
swaying ofthelemon, which rocked toand frowith
more orlessvehemence according totheemphasis
(asmyfriend informed me)withwhich thereplywas
tobedelivered. Negation, ontheother hand, was
indicated byacomplete cessation ofmotion onthe
partofthelemon.
When itisrequired todiscover, forinstance, the
name ofathief, thenames ofallthosewho areatall
likely tohave committed the theft arewritten on
scraps ofpaper andarranged inacircle round the
brazier, when thelemon will atonce swing inthe
direction ofthename oftheguilty party. Thebest
night fortheperformance ofthisceremony isaTuesday.

SirFrank Swettenham saccount ofasimilar cere-
mony ofwhich hewasaneye-witness willserve asa
good illustration ofthemethods inuseforthispur-
pose:—
“Itwasmymisfortune some years ago tobe
robbed ofsome valuable property, andseveral Malay
friends strongly advised metotake theadvice ofan
astrologer, orother learned person who (sothey said)
would beable togive thename ofthethief, andprob-
ablyrecover most ofthestolen things. Ifearthat I
hadnogreat faith inthismethod ofdetection, but I
wasanxious toseewhat could bedone, fortheEast is
acurious place, andnoonewithaninquiring mind can
have lived initlongwithout seeing phenomena that
arenotalways explained bymodern text-books on
Natural Philosophy.
“Iwas firstintroduced toanArab ofveryremark-
able appearance. Hewasabout fiftyyears old, tall,
with pleasant features and extraordinary gray-blue
eyes, clearand far-seeing, aman ofstriking andim-
pressive personality. Iwas travelling when Imet
him,and tried topersuade him toreturn withme,but
thathesaidhecould notdo,though hepromised to
followmebyanearly steamer. Hesaidhewould be
able totellme allabout therobbery, whocommitted
it,where thestolen property then was,andthat allhe
would want wasanempty house wherein hemight
fast insolitude forthree days, without which prepara-
tion,hesaid, hewould notbeable toseewhat he
sought. Hetoldmethat after his vigil, fast,and
prayer, hewould layinhishand asmall piece ofpaper
onwhich there would besome writing;into thishe
would pour alittle water, and inthatextemporised
mirror hewould seeavision ofthewhole transaction.

Hedeclared that, aftergazing intently into thisdivin-
ing-glass, theinquirer firstrecognised thefigure ofa
little oldman. That having duly saluted thisJin ,it
wasnecessary toaskhim toconjure upthescene of
therobbery, when allthedetails would bere-enacted
intheliquid glass under theeyes ofthegazer, who
would thereandthen describe allthathesaw. Ihad
heard allthis before, only ithadbeen stated tome
then thatthemedium through whose eyes thevision
could alone beseenmust beayoung child ofsuch
tender years that itcould have never told alie!
TheArab, however, professed himself notonly able to
conjure upthescene, buttoletmesee itformyself if
Iwould follow hisdirections. Unfortunately, my
gray-eyed friend failed tokeep hispromise, and I
never methimagain.
“A local Chief, however, declared hispower to
read thepastbythismethod, ifonlyhecould findthe
truthful child. Inthisheappeared tosucceed, but
when, onthefollowing day,hecame todisclose tome
theresults ofhis skill, hesaid that adifficulty had
arisen, because justwhen thechild (alittle boy)was
beginning torelate what hesawhesuddenly became
unconscious, and ittook theastrologer twohours to
restore him tohisnormal state. Allthemothers of
tender-aged andpossibly truthful children declined after
this tolend their offspring fortheordeal.

either another title ofShiva, orstands forKali, his

but itmaybedoubted whether thisdivision oftime
isnotofJavanese orMalayan origin, although the
importance ofthenumber Jive isalsorecognised bythe
Hindus .2
Thesame mystic notions ofcolour and the like
areattached tothese divisions bytheMalays as

thus Maheswara’s colour isyellow -white (fiutek

Similarly S’ri’s colour iswhite, Brahma’s isred,
Vishnu’s isgreen, andeach division has itsrespective
advantages ordisadvantages .1
Another version ofthissystem, known astheFive

itsdivisions, viz.Ahmad, Jibra’il (Gabriel), Ibrahim
(Abraham), Yusuf (Joseph), and ‘Azra’il (Azrael).

For thesecond daytheseries begins with the
Moon, andgoesonintheabove order toMercury;
and forthethird day itbegins withMars;sothat
each day oftheweek begins with itsappropriate
planet intheusual order, which isbestseen inthe
French names Mardi, Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi, and
theEnglish Saturday, Sunday andMonday.
Each oftheseven divisions has itslucky orunlucky
characteristics, much asinthesystems already de-
scribed.
Besides these, eachdayoftheweek has itsown
appropriate occupations, according toanother system,
attimes ascertained bymeasuring thelength ofone’s
shadow. Further, itwould appear thatsome days
areunlucky altogether :oneaccount gives seven un-
lucky days inevery month;another asserts thatThurs-
day isunlucky inthemonths Dhu-’l-hijjah, Muharram,
andSafar;Tuesday inRabi‘-al-awal, Rabi‘-al-akhir,
andJumada-’l-awal;Saturday inJumada-’l-akhir,
Rejab andSha'ban;Sunday inRamadhan, Shawal,
and Dhu-’l-ka‘idah;athird specifies twelve other
most inauspicious days inevery year, viz.the28th of
Muharram, the10thofSafar, the14thofRabi‘-al-awal,

Most ofthese systems ofdivination involve the
construction ofasortofcalendar, andrequire some
degree ofastronomical knowledge;butofastronomy
properly so-called theMalays have scarcely even a
smattering, itsplace being taken bythe, tothem,
farmore important science ofastrology. “Their
meagre ideas regarding themotions oftheheavenly
bodies are derived, through theArabs, from the
Ptolemaic system.”2
The seven Heavenly Bodies (Bintang Tujok),
mentioned above, whose motions they believe tobe
produced bytheagency ofangels,3retain theirArabic
names,4andarebelieved torulethe“seven ominous
moments ”(Katika Tujoh),which aresupposed to
depend ontheinfluences ofthese several sidereal
bodies.5
Thesigns oftheZodiac similarly bear Arabic ap-
pellations, theform ofdivination inwhich they bear
theprincipal partbeing called theTwelve Constella-
tions (Bintang Dua-b' las).6
This form ofdivination isnotquite socommon
asarethose oftheFiveOminous Times (5-square) and
theSeven Heavenly Bodies (7-square), and Ihave
notbeen able tofindoutmuch about themethods of
working it,butacopy ofoneofthediagrams used

VI BINTANG DUA-B'LAS 55i
According toone view, which isperhaps the
prevalent one,every man’s luck isdetermined byone
orother ofthezodiacal constellations, and inorder
tofindoutwhich one itis,thefollowing direction is
given:—
“Reckon thenumerical equivalent oftheperson’s
name andofthename ofhismother bythevalues of
theletters according tothesystem oftheAbjad;add
thetwonumerical equivalents together, and divide
thetotalbytwelve; iftheremainder is1,hissign is
theRam, if2,theBull,andsoon.”
Each constellation hasaseries ofcharacteristics
which aresupposed toinfluence thewhole lifeofthe
person who issubject toit.1
Besides theabove, afewoftheother constellations
areknown topossess Malay names, andwherever this
isthe case, thename given appears usually tobe
quite original, having noconnection with thenomen-
clature obtaining among nations withwhich weare
more familiar .2
Inaddition totheabove, theMalays possess a
curious system bywhich thelunarmonth isdivided
intoanumber ofparts called Rejang .According to
Newbold, “thetwenty-eight Rejangs resemble theNac-
shatras orlunar mansions oftheHindoos, rather than

;1and itisapriori veryprob-
able thattheyowe their origin tothisHindu system.
ButbytheMalays their application hasbeen generally
misunderstood, and theirnumber isusually raised to
thirty soastofitthedays ofthelunar month. Each
ofthese divisions has itssymbol, which isusually an
animal, andthe firstanimal inthe list is(inalmost all
versions) thehorse.Ahorses head isalsothefigure

tobelittle trace ofidentity intheremaining figures,

Malays have embodied thissystem inaseries of
mnemonic verses (known asSka‘ir Rejang),ofwhich
there areseveral versions, eg.theRejang of’Che
Busu, theRejang Sindiran Maiat,andothers .2
TheRejangs arealsodealt with atlength inprose

with thedays ofthelunar month, begins “on the

istomake arepresentation ofahorseandthrow it
away towards the(East?)”1Inother respects this
system ofdivination seems toagree initsmain
features with those which have already been
described.
Having mentioned thedivisions ofthecalendar
which arechiefly used indivination, itseems desirable,
forthesake ofcompleteness, toallude briefly tothose
thatremain.
“The better informed Malays acknowledge the
solar year of365 days, which they term thetoun
(tahun) shemsiah,but inobedience totheirMoham-
medan instructors, adopt thelunar year(tounkum-
riah)of354days.”2
Thisremark isstilltrue,nodoubt, oftheup-country
Malays ontheWest Coast, but inmost districts,
and toanextent commensurate with European
influence, thesolar year isnowbeing gradually intro-
duced.
Thesame remark applies tothemethod ofreckon-
ingmonths, adualsystem being now invogue in
many places where there ismost contact withEuro-
peans. Regarding thenative methods thefollowing
quotation istothepoint:—
“There arethree ways ofreckoning themonths.

month, andtwenty-nine tothesecond month, andso
onalternately totheendoftheyear.
“Second, thePersian mode, viz.thirty days toeach
month;and, thirdly, that ofRum, i.e .thirty-one days
tothemonth. The first isingeneral use.Some few,
withgreater accuracy, calculate their year at354days
eight hours, intercalating every three years twenty-four
hours, oronedaytomake upthedeficiency, andthirty-
three days forthedifference between thesolar and
lunar years.
“Butthemajority ofthelower classes estimate their
yearbythe fruit seasons andbytheir crops ofrice
only. Many, however, obstinately adhere tothelunar
months, andplant theirpaddy attheannual return of
thelunar month.”
“TheMalay months havebeen divided intoweeks
ofseven days,marked bythereturn oftheMoham-
medan Sabbath. Natives whohave hadintercourse
withEuropeans divide thedayandnight intotwenty-
four parts, butthemajority measure thedaybythe
sun’s apparent progress through theheavens, thecrow
ofthecock, etc.The religious daycommences at
sunset, likethatoftheArabs andHebrews.”
“There aretwo cycles borrowed from theArabs,
andknown only toafew, viz.one of120 years,
th.edour1besar, andtheother ofeight, dour kechil.
The latter issometimes seen indates ofletters, and
resembles themode adopted byusofdistinguishing by
letters thedifferent days oftheweek, substituting eight
years fortheseven days. Theorder oftheletters is

VI MAGIC SQUARES 555
IfindtheSiamese mode ofdesignating thedifferent
years ofthecycle bythenames ofanimals adopted.”1
Most ifnot allthese systems ofreckoning seem to
havebeen treated bytheMalays from theastrological
point ofview asforming abasis fordivination, and
these crude notions ofthelucky orunlucky nature of
certain times andseasons aretosome extent systemat-
isedbyorinsome degree mixed upwith theideaof
themystic influence ofnumbers and geometrical
figures.
Ofthemystic figures used indivination, the first in
importance is,nodoubt, what hasbeen called the
“magic square,” aterm applied to“asetofnumbers
arranged inasquare insuchamanner thatthevertical,

The ordinary Malay astrologer most likely under-
stands very little ofthepeculiar properties ofamagic
square, andconsequently henotunfrequently makes
mistakes inthearrangement ofthefigures. Ibelieve,
also, that inusing thesquares forpurposes ofdivination
henowusually begins atonecorner andcounts straight
on,thebeginning place being almost always distin-
guished byasmall solitary crescent orcrescent and

Sometimes, again, thenames ofthe fiveHindu
deities already mentioned willbefound similarly
arranged, inwhich case theyappear torefer tothe
divisions oftheday,described above under thename
ofKatika Lima. Besides thisclass ofmagic squares,
however, there areother kinds which present irregu-
larities, andarenotsoeasily explainable. Some of
these violate thefundamental rule ofthemagic
square, which insists thateach square shallhave an
equalnumber ofsmall squares running eachway,and
that thisnumber shallbeanoddone.
Others exhibit therightnumber ofsmall squares
(3x3or5x5or7x7), butinstead ofasubdivision
intosub-groups, have merely anarrangement ofalter-
native emblems, such asabudandafull-blown flower,
orthelike.
Ananalysis ofthesquares whose figures aregiven

compasses.” Ofthese thecommonest form isadraw-
ing, inwhich theplaces usually occupied bythepoints
ofthecompass areoccupied bythenames ofcertain
things (usually animals orbirds) which aresupposed
tobenaturally opposed toeach other. Thus inone
ofthese compass-like figures wefind (vide PI.25,
Fig. 2)
TheBird \sic\(N.) opposed totheFowl (S.)
TheCrocodile (N.E.) „ „„Fish (S.W.)
TheRat(E.) „ „„Cat(W.)

TheCrocodile (N.E.) „ „„Fish (S.W.)
TheRat(E.) „ „„Cat(W.)

TheCrocodile (E.),, ,, ,,Fish(W.)

whilst afourth hasalternately capeandbay.
Theway inwhich these figures were used fordivi-
nation isvery clearly shown byPL25,Fig. 1,which is
copied from afigure inoneofmy(Selangor) charm-
books, which hadthedays ofthemonth, from the 1st
tothe30th, written round itinblue ink. Starting
from thenorth aspect, youcount round totheleftuntil
(allowing oneday toeach aspect) you arrive atthe
aspect corresponding tothenumber ofthedayofthe
month upon which youwish tostart your journey.

stronger influences, andyou willbeallright. Ifthe
firstaspect-compass which youconsult isnotaccom-
modating enough foryour requirements, gooncon-
sulting others untilyoufindonewhich issatisfactory.
Other forms ofthecompass-figure areused for
divining whether ifhestarts onacertain daytheman
willgetthebetter ofhisenemy, ormeet withaperson
(eg. aslave orathief) whohasrunaway. Inthe
former case adouble circle ofhuman figures isused,
thefigures oftheinner circle representing theperson
who seeks theinformation, andthose oftheouter
circle hisenemy. Thecounting iscarried outinpre-
cisely thesame manner asbefore, andtheheadless
figure ineach case represents themanwho will lose.
Inthecaseofadrawn battle neither party, ofcourse,
loses hishead.
Inthecase ofanabsconder, asingle circle of
figures isused, thefigures pointing towards thecentre
signifying thattheabsconding party willreturn orbe
caught, andthose pointing away from thecentre signi-
fying theopposite. Inonecase (PI. 25,Fig. 2)there
arefourteen human figures arranged intwoopposing
rows ofseven, every alternate figure being headless.
Inthiscaseyou start thecounting attheright-hand
figure ofthebottom row,andcount towards the left.
Yetanother form ofdivination inwhich thehuman
figure ismade use of,isshown inPI.25,Fig. r;a

Figures ofdragons(naga)andscorpions(kala)are
sometimes used inasimilar manner;andthere isalso
anaspect-compass known asthe Rctjal-cil-ghaib or
Jinazah Sayidna ‘Ali ibnAbu Talib (thebody or

according tothis notion, “iscontinually being carried
byangels1towards the different quarters ofthe

The aspect tobeavoided varies from day today,
turning towards eachoftheeight points oftheordinary
Malay compass three orfourtimes inthelunar month.
Thesubject ofomens ingeneral hasbeen shortly
dealt with atthebeginning ofthis section, and also
incidentally mentioned inconnection with various
departments ofnature andhuman life. Itwould
hardly bepossible tomake acomplete orsystematic
listofthethings fromwhich omens aretaken. Apart
from those depending merely onTimes, Seasons,
Numbers, andAspect, which have been already dealt
with atquite sufficient length, itmaybenoted that
omens aredrawn from earthquakes, thunder, “house-
lizards, rats,andother four-footed things,” according
tothetimes atwhich they areobserved, from the
colour, smell, andnature ofsoil(inchoosing building-
sites), from birds, and, infact,from avery large variety
ofmatters which cannot beclassified under anygeneral
head. The lines ofthehand are,ofcourse, interpreted

evilfortune. Ithasnotbeen possible tocollect much
information onthesubject ofMalay chiromancy, but
forthebenefit ofEuropean adepts in‘‘palmistry” (as
itseems tobeusually styled nowadays) itmay be
worth while mentioning that theMalays attach im-

More important, perhaps, aretheomens believed
tobederived from dreams, ofwhich there seem to

thing beginning withTisvery lucky indeed, todream
ofathing beginning withHmeans thatavisitor from
adistance istobeexpected;Nindicates sorrow, Lis
ahint togive alms tothepoor andneedy, andso
forth. According toanother system, apurely arbitrary
meaning isputupon thesubject-matter ofthedream,

terpretation. Thus todream ofagaleofwind inthe

Asaspecimen oftheimportance traditionally
ascribed todreams, itseems worth while togive the
following popular legend, which also illustrates the
type offolk-tales inwhich hidden treasure plays a
great part:—
“Che Puteh Jambai and hiswifewere verypoor

multitude ofrival claims sobewildered theunhappy

never since been seen. Their property wasnever

andwent toseek for itinthedistant lands ofKacha-

Charms,Talismans,andWitchcraft
While bydivination andbyinferences fromomens
anddreams, Malays attempt toascertain thecourse
offate, sobycharms ofthenature ofamulets and
talismans theysometimes endeavour toinfluence its
direction ormodify itsforce. Charms ofthenature
ofinvocations have been dealt with already under
different headings inconnection with avariety of
matters, and itwillonlybenecessary torefer here toa
fewmiscellaneous ones ofalesselaborate character.
Itshould beobserved thatsome charms aredirectly
effective orprotective, likeamulets ortalismans,
while others aresupposed towork onlybyinfluen-
cing thevolition ofanother mind. Under the latter
head come thegreat mass oflove-charms, charms
forsecuring conjugal fidelity, orforcompelling the

VI TALISMANS 567
revelation byanother person ofhisorher secret
thoughts, and the like, ofwhich Malay books of
magic are full;while under theformer come sundry
recipes ofamore orlessmedicinal nature forthepur-
pose ofcuring various diseases, ofincreasing physical
power orvirility, orofprotecting theperson against
evil influences, natural orsupernatural. Inmost of
these cases themodus operandi isofthesimplest char-
acter;thecharm consists usually ofashort Arabic
prayer orafew letters and figures, sometimes quite
meaningless andconventional, sometimes making up
oneormore ofthesacred names (Allah, Muhammad,
‘Ali, etc.). These charms arewritten onpaper orcloth
andworn ontheperson;sometimes they arewritten
onthebody itself, especially onthepart tobeaffected;
occasionally they arewritten onacupwhich isthen
used fordrinking purposes. Such prescriptions are
infinite innumber, andaretobefound inMalay charm-
books, wedged inamongst matter ofamore strictly
medical kind;infact, itwould bequite correct tosay
that letter-charms [rajah, \azimat)andsacred names
have their place intheMalay Pharmacopoeia sideby
sidewith spices, herbs, roots, andthe like. Butsuch
charms arealsoused formany other purposes :“to
ward offdemons [sheitan), tomake children feed at
thebreast properly, toprevent them from crying and
fromgoing intoconvulsions, toprevent therice-crops
from being devoured bypigs, rats,andmaggots,”
areconsecutive instances ofthecharms contained in
apage ofoneofthenumerous Malay treatises on
these matters. Itwould, from thenature ofthecase,
beutterly impossible toexhaust thisendless subject,
and itisnotnecessary todwell upon itatgreater
length, asthedetails ofthecharms used (ofwhich a


568 DIVINATION ANDTHEBLACK ART CHAP.
fewarequoted intheAppendix) donotasarule offer
anyfeatures ofgeneral interest .1
Farmore interesting isthatform oftheBlack Art
which attempts to“abduct,” orinsomeway“get at”
another person’s soul,whether (asinthecase ofthe
ordinary love-charm), inorder toinfluence itinthe
operator’s favour, or,ontheother hand, with aview to
doing thevictim some harm, which maytake theform
ofmadness, disease, oreven death.
These results canbearrived atbyavariety of
methods :insome ofthem theinfluence works entirely
without contact, inothers there issome sortofcontact
between thevictim andthereceptacle intowhich his
soul istobeenticed. Afewspecimens ofthemethods
employed willconclude thispart ofthesubject;they
arenecessarily somewhat ofamiscellaneous character,
but itwillbeseen thatthey arereally only different
applications ofthesame general principle, thenature
ofwhich hasalready been indicated inthesection on
theSoul .2
The following isaninstance ofdirect contact
between thesoulreceptacle and itsowner’s body—
“Take soilfrom thecentre ofthefootprint(hati-
hati tapak) oftheperson youwish tocharm, and
‘treat itceremonially’
(di-puja)forabout three days.
“The‘ceremonial treatment’consists inwrapping
itupinpieces ofred, black, andyellow cloth3(the

Itmaybesafely estimated that the
sexual relations arehere ofthe first

indirectly.

yellow being outside), andhanging itfrom thecentre
ofyour mosquito-curtain with parti-coloured thread
(penggantong-nya benang panchar ond). Itwillthen
become (the domicile of)your victim’s soul {jadi
semangat). Youmust, however, tocomplete thecere-
mony, switch itwith abirch ofseven leaf-ribs taken
from a ‘green’cocoa-nut(penyembat-nya lidiniyor
hijau tujoh Vet)seven times atsundown, seven times
atmidnight, andseven times atsunrise, continuing
thisforthree days, andsaying asyoudoso:—
“*Itisnotearth that Iswitch,
Buttheheart ofSo-and-so
(Bukan-nya akumenyembat tanah
,
Akumenyembat hati SiAnu).
“Then bury itinthemiddle ofapathwhere your
victim issure tostepover it(supaya buleh di-langkah-
nya), andhewillcertainly become distraught. The
onlytaboo inconnection with itisthatyoushould let
nooneshare your sleeping -mat.” The soul-recep-
tacle inthiscase isthelump ofearth taken from the
centre ofthevictim’s footprint. Itissaid toactually
“become (the victim’s) soul,” butnodoubt this is
merely figurative, though itcompletely proves the
identification ofthesoul with itsreceptacle inthe
Malay mind. The object ofthebirching isnotself-
evident, butmaybeintended todispel evilinfluences,
andsopurify itfortheincoming soul.
Another wayofobtaining therequired result isto
scrape offsome ofthewood ofthefloorfrom theplace
where your intended victim hasbeen sitting. Having
secured this, takesome of’the soilfrom hisorher
footprint andmixthem both together withwaxfrom
adeserted bees’ comb, moulding thefigure into his

orher likeness. Fumigate itwith incense, and
“beckon” tothesoulbywaving acloth (lambei
semangat) every night forthree nights successively,
reciting thischarm :—
“‘OM !’shout itagain andagain !
Stupid anddazed
Betheheart ofSomebody,
Thinking ofme.
Ifyoudonotthink ofme,
The forty-four angels shall curse you.”
Another method isasfollows:—
Take parings ofnails, hair,eyebrows, saliva, etc.of
your intended victim (sufficient torepresent every part
ofhisperson), andmake them upinto hislikeness
withwaxfrom adeserted bees’ comb. Scorch the
figure slowly byholding itover alamp every night for
seven nights, andsay:—
“Itisnotwaxthat Iamscorching,
Itisthe liver, heart, andspleen ofSo-and-so that Iscorch.”
After theseventh time burn the figure, andyour
victim will die.
The description ofthenext ceremony istaken
word forword from acharm-book which Iobtained
from aLangat Malay (named ’Che Indut), andwhich
isstill inmypossession. As itillustrates several new
points about thesewax figures, andassuchcharms are

There are,as Ihave said, several newpoints tobe
gotfrom thischarm. You mustmake theimage
resemble acorpse
;youmustmake itofthelength

nails, etc.)would have tobeworkedupwith thewax,andthatthey arenot
mentioned, because understood.

and, finally,
inorder toabsolve yourself from blood-guiltiness, you
shift theburden ofyourcrime ontotheshoulders of
theArchangel Gabriel !!!
There are,ofcourse, many slight variations ofthe
actual ceremony. Sometimes thewizard, during the
insertion ofthepins intotheimage, exclaims:—
“Itisnotwaxthat Islay2
Butthe liver, heart, andspleen ofSo-and-so.”
And then, after “waving”thefigure inthesmoke of
theincense, anddepositing itinthecentre ofasacri-
ficial tray(anchak),heinvites the spirits tobanquet
upon hisvictim’s body:—
“Idonotbanquet youupon anything else,3

When theceremony isover theimage isburied inthe
usualway infront ofthevictim’s door-step.
Another method isdescribed asfollows:—
“Make thewaxfigure intheusualwayandwith the

This isacharm forsowing dissension between
husband andwife(pembenchi):—
Make twoofthewax figures intheordinary way,
buttaking care thatoneresembles thehusband and
theother thewife. Sitdown withyour legsstretched
outbefore you,andhold thefigures face tofacewhile
yourepeat thecharm thrice, and attheendofeach
repetition breathe upon their heads. Then laythe
manupon theground onyour right sideclose toyour
thigh, butlooking away from it;andthewoman atthe
sideofthe leftthigh inasimilar position, sothatthey
both lookaway fromeach other. Then burn incense
and recite thesamecharm twenty-two times over the
manandtwenty-two times over thewoman. Now
putthem back toback, andwrap them upinseven
thicknesses oftheleaves oftnkas/and tiethem round
with thread ofseven colours wrapped seven times
round them, repeat thecharm andbury them. Dig
themupafterseven daysandsee iftheyare stillthere.
Ifyou findthem thecharm has failed, but ifnot, it
willwork, andthey willassuredly bedivorced. The
charm runs asfollows:—

“Thou, Fatimah, artagoat;

Thefollowing isaclearexample ofsoulabduction
without contact:—
The simplest way, perhaps, ofabducting another
person’s soul istogoout,when thesun clears
\matahari mencharak,atsunrise?), orwhen the
newly-risen moon looks red,andstanding with the
bigtoeoftheright foot resting onthebigtoeof
the left, tomake atrumpet ofyour right hand and
recite theappropriate charm through thisimprovised
speaking-trumpet thrice. Attheendofeach recital
youblow through thehollowed fist. Thecharm
runs asfollows:—
“‘OM.’ Iloosemyshaft, Iloose itandthemoon clouds
over,
Iloose it,andthesun isextinguished,
Iloose it,andthestarsburn dim.

Asecond method istobeatyourownshadow,1

cane (ofrattan orrotan sega), inlength aslong asyour
body, fumigate itwith incense and recite acharm over
itseven times, striking yourownshadow with thecane
onceafter each recital. Repeat this atsundown, mid-
night, and early morning, andsleep under acoverlet
made offive cubits ofwhite cloth, andthesoulyou

thecharm, avery curious one:—
“Ho !Irupi, Shadowy One,

Another method ofabducting another person’s soul
isasfollows:—
“Take alimebranch which hasseven limes on
asingle stalk, andsuspend itfrom thetopofyour

isthattheshadow issupposed insome
way toembody oratleast represent
thesoul. Thus thefemale reapers of
the firstripepadi arespecially enjoined
toreap inastraight linefacing thesun,
sothat theirshadow maynot fallupon

thespeaker’s shadow -soul isexpected
tofetch thewoman’s body-soul, andthe
beating oftheshadow-soul isperhaps
purely ceremonial, todrive away evilinfluences from it,before itstarts on
itsjourney, butthis latter suggestion is
merely conjectural. The first lineof
thecharm, however, inwhich the
speaker addresses hisshadow byname
(Irupi) ashestrikes itwith thecane,
points outmost clearly theconnection
between thebody-soul (orpuppet-soul)
andtheshadow-soul, towhich Ihave
referred. The coverlet orwhite cloth

Thefollowing ceremony isone inwhich thesoulof
another person isabducted without anydirect contact
between thesoul-receptacle, which inthiscase isa

follows:—
“Go outonthefourteenth night ofthelunar
month (fullmoon) andtwosuccessive nights;seat

Atsundown, when thesun ishovering onthe

Then stand opposite thedoor, looking ifpossible
towards thewest, burn incense, andrepeat thischarm:—

Itwillbenoticed thatageneral similarity underlies
these several methods ofsoul-abduction inspite oftheir
apparent variety, andthediversity oftheobjects in
view inthedifferent cases. Onthispoint itisimpos-
sible toenlarge here :thepurpose ofthisbook has
been primarily tocollect authentic specimens ofthe
various magic practices invogue among theMalays of
theMalay Peninsula, andtoindicate thenature ofthe
beliefs onwhich these practices arebased, leaving it
forothers todraw fromthem such inferences and to
make suchcomparisons asmaythrow further lighton
thesubject. Ithasnotbeendeemed desirable to
anticipate such inferences andcomparisons here;but,
without trespassing beyond thescope ofthepresent
work, itmaybenoticed thatthere isaspecial appro-
priateness inconcluding itwith theabove account of
thevarious methods ofsoul-abduction. From them,
taken together withwhat hasalready been saidonthe
subject,1afairly complete ideacanbegathered ofthe
Malay conception oftheSoul
;and itishardly too
much tosaythat thisconception isthecentral feature
ofthewhole system ofMalay magic and folklore,
fromwhich allthedifferent branches with their various
applications appear tospring.
The root-idea seems tobean all -pervading
Animism, involving acertain common vital principle
(semangat)inMan andNature, which, forwant ofa
more suitable word, hasbeen here called theSoul.
The application ofthisgeneral theory oftheuniverse

totherequirements oftheindividual man constitutes
theMagic Art,which, asconceived bytheMalays,
may besaid toconsist ofthemethods bywhich
this Soul, whether ingods, men, animals, vege-
tables, minerals, orwhat not,may beinfluenced,
captured, subdued, orinsomewaymade subject tothe
willofthemagician.
Itwould, however, probably beamistake topush
thisanalysis toofar;forsidebysidewith thetheory
ofauniverse animated bysouls, which bytheuseof
theappropriate words andforms canbecajoled or
threatened, there aretheideas ofLuck and Ill-luck,
andthenotion, strong inMuhammadans allover the
world, ofapreordained course ofevents. Sometimes,
presumably inextreme cases, there isnoescape from
thisdestiny :ifaman isfated todieatacertain time,
diehemust, whatever hemay do.But toagreat
extent ill-luck canbeavoided ifoneknows how;
though wecannot stop it,weneed notexpose our-
selves toitsinfluence. Thus aparticular hourmay
beunlucky forthedoing ofacertain act;but ifwe
know that itisso,weneed notincur thedanger.
There are,therefore, foraMalay three alternatives,
itwould seem :viz.Charms, foroccasions where moral
pressure canbebrought tobear;Divination, toassist
indetecting dangers which intheordinary course
mustcome butcanbeavoided;and, Anally, Islam
(Resignation), when hehastomeet the inevitable,
whether itberegarded asthecourse ofFate orthe
eternal purpose ofGod.
