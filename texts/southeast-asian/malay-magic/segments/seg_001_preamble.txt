PREFACE
The circumstances attending thecomposition and
publication ofthepresent work have thrown upon
metheduty offurnishing itwith apreface explaining
itsobject andscope.
Briefly, thepurpose oftheauthor hasbeen to
collect intoaBook ofMalay Folklore allthatseemed
tohimmost typical ofthesubject amongst acon-
siderable mass ofmaterials, some ofwhich lay
scattered inthepages ofvarious other works, others
inunpublished native manuscripts, andmuch innotes
made byhim personally ofwhat hehadobserved
during several years spent intheMalay Peninsula,
principally intheState ofSelangor. Thebook does
notprofess tobeanexhaustive orcomplete treatise,
butrather, asitstitle indicates, anintroduction tothe
study ofFolklore, Popular Religion, andMagic as
understood among theMalays ofthePeninsula.
Itshould besuperfluous, atthistime ofday, to
defend such studies asthese from thecriticisms which
have from time totimebeen brought against them.
Iremember myoldfriend andformer teacher, Wan


Vlll PREFACE
'Abdullah, aSingapore Malay ofTrengganu extrac-
tionandArab descent, adevout andlearned Muham-
madan andamost charming man, objecting tothem
onthegrounds, first, that they were useless, and,
secondly, which, asheemphatically declared, was far
worse, thattheywere perilous tothesouls health.
This last isapoint ofview which itwould hardly
beappropriate orprofitable todiscuss here, buta
fewwords may aswellbedevoted totheother objec-
tion. Itisbased, sometimes, ontheground that
these studies deal notwith “facts,” butwithmere
nonsensical fancies and beliefs. Now, forfactswe
all,ofcourse, have thegreatest respect;butthe
objection appears tometoinvolve anunwarrantable
restriction ofthemeaning oftheword :abelief which
isactually held,even amere fancy that isentertained
inthemind, hasarealexistence, and isafactjustas
much asany other. Asapiece ofpsychology it
must always have acertain interest, and itmayon
occasions become ofenormous practical importance.
If,forinstance, in1857 certain persons, whose con-
cern itwas,hadpaidmore attention tofacts ofthis
kind, possibly theIndian Mutiny could have been
prevented, andprobably itmight havebeen foreseen,
sothatprecautionary measures could havebeen taken
intime tominimise theextent ofthecatastrophe.
Itisnotsuggested that thematters dealt with inthis
book areever likely toinvolve such serious issues;
but, speaking generally, there canbenodoubt


PREFACE IX
thatanunderstanding oftheideas andmodes of
thought ofanalien people inarelatively lowstage
ofcivilisation facilitates very considerably thetask
ofgoverning them;and intheMalay Peninsula
that task hasnowdevolved mainly upon English-
men. Moreover, every notion ofutility implies an
endtowhich itistobereferred, andthere areother
ends inlifeworth considering aswell asthose to
which the“practical man” ispleased torestrict
himself. When one passes from the practical to
thespeculative point ofview, itisalmost impos-
sible topredict what piece ofknowledge willbe
fruitful ofresults, andwhat willnot;
prima facie,
therefore, allknowledge has aclaim tobecon-
sidered ofimportance from ascientific point ofview,
and until everything isknown, nothing can safely
berejected asworthless.
Another andmore serious objection, aimed rather
atthemethod ofsuch investigations asthese, is
that theevidence withwhich theyhave tobecon-
tent isworth little ornothing. Objectors attempt
todiscredit itbyimplying that atbest itisonlywhat
A.says that B.toldhimabout thebeliefs B.sayshe
holds, inother words, that itisthemerest hearsay;
and itisalsosometimes suggested thatwhen A.
isaEuropean and B.asavage, oratmost asemi-
civilised person ofanother breed, thechances are
that B.will lieabout hisalleged beliefs, orthat
A.willunconsciously read hisown ideas into B.’s


X PREFACE
confused statements, orthat, atany rate,onewayor
another, they aresure tomisunderstand each other,
andaccordingly therecord cannot beafaithful one.
Sofarasthis objection canhave any applica-
tion tothepresent work, itmay fairly bereplied :
first that theauthor hasbeen atsome pains to
corroborate and illustrate hisown accounts bythe
independent observations ofothers (and thismust
behisjustification forthecopiousness ofhisquota-
tions from other writers);and, secondly, thathehas,
whenever possible, given uswhat isreally thebest
kind ofevidence forhisown statements byrecord-
ingthecharms andother magic formulae which are
actually inuse.Ofthese agreat number hasbeen
here collected, and inthetranslation ofsuch ofthe
more interesting ones asarequoted inthetext of
thebook, every effort hasbeenmade tokeep to
literal accuracy ofrendering. The originals willbe
found intheAppendix, and itmust belefttothose
whocanreadMalay tocheck theauthor’s versions,
and todraw from the untranslated portions such
inferences asmayseem tothem good.
The author himself hasnopreconceived thesis
tomaintain :hisobject hasbeen collection rather
than comparison, and quite apart from theneces-
sary limitations ofspace and time, hismethod has
confined thebook within fairly well-defined bounds.
Though thesubject isonewhich would naturally
lend itself toacomparative treatment, andthough


PREFACE XI
thecomparison ofMalay folklore with that ofother
nations (more particularly ofIndia, Arabia, and the
mainland ofIndo- China) would nodoubt lead to
very interesting results, thescope ofthework has
asfaraspossible been restricted tothefolklore of
theMalays ofthePeninsula. Accordingly theana-
logous and often quite similar customs andideas of
theMalayan races oftheEastern Archipelago have
been only occasionally referred to,while those of
theChinese andother non-Malayan inhabitants of
thePeninsula havebeen excluded altogether.
Moreover, several important departments ofcus-
tomand social lifehave been, nodoubt designedly,
omitted :thus, tomention onlyonesubject outof
several that willprobably occur tothe reader, the
modes oforganisation oftheFamily and theClan
(which incertain Malay communities present archaic
features ofnocommon interest), together with the
derivative notions affecting thetenure and inherit-
ance ofproperty, have found noplace inthiswork.
The field, infact, isvery wide andcannot allbe
worked atonce. The folklore ofuncivilised races
may fairly enough besaid toembrace every phase
ofnature andevery department oflife :itmaybe
regarded ascontaining, inthegerm and asyetun-
differentiated, thenotions from which Religion, Law,
Medicine, Philosophy, Natural Science, and Social
Customs areeventually evolved. Itsbulkand rela-
tiveimportance seem tovary inversely with the


Xll PREFACE
advance ofarace intheprogress towards civilisa-
tion;and theideas ofsavages onthese matters
appear toconstitute insome cases agreat and
complex system, ofwhich comparatively fewtraces
only are leftamong themore civilised peoples.
TheMalay race, while farremoved from thesavage
condition, hasnotasyetreached avery high stage
ofcivilisation, and still retains relatively large rem-
nants ofthis primitive order ofideas. Itistrue
thatMalay notions onthese subjects areunder-
going aprocess ofdisintegration, the rapidity of
which hasbeen considerably increased bycontact
with European civilisation, but, such asthey are,
these ideas stillform agreat factor inthe lifeofthe
mass ofthepeople.
Itmay, however, bedesirable topoint outthat
thecomplexity ofMalay folklore istobeattributed
inpart to itssingularly mixed character. The
development oftherace from savagery and bar-
barism uptoitspresent condition ofcomparative
civilisation hasbeen modified anddetermined, first
andmost deeply byIndian, and during the last
five centuries orsobyArabian influences. Just
asinthelanguage oftheMalays itispossible by
analysis topick outwords ofSanskrit andArabic
torigin from amongst themain body ofgenuinely
native words, sointheir folklore one finds Hindu,
Buddhist, andMuhammadan ideas overlying amass
ofapparently original Malay notions.


PREFACE xm
These various elements oftheir folklore are,how-
ever,now sothoroughly mixed uptogether that it
isoften almost impossible todisentangle them. No
systematic attempt hasbeenmade todosointhis
book, although hereand there anindication ofthe
origin ofsome particular myth willbefound;but
acomplete analysis (ifpossible atall)would have
necessitated, asapreliminary investigation, amuch
deeper study ofHindu andMuhammadan mythology
than ithasbeen found practicable toengage in.
Inorder, however, togive aclear notion ofthe
relation which thebeliefs and practices that arehere
recorded bear tothe official religion ofthepeople,
itisnecessary tostate that theMalays ofthePenin-
sulaareSunniMuhammadans oftheschool ofShafki,
and that nothing, theoretically speaking, could be
more correct andorthodox (from thepoint ofview
ofIslam) than thebelief which they profess.
But the beliefs which they actually hold are
another matter altogether, and itmust beadmitted
that theMuhammadan veneer which covers their
ancient superstitions isvery often ofthethinnest
description. The inconsistency inwhich this in-
volves them isnot,however, asarule realised by
themselves. Beginning their invocations with the
orthodox preface :“Inthename ofGod\themerciful,
thecompassionate ,”andending them withanappeal
totheCreed :“There isnogodbutGod
,andMu-
hammad istheApostle ofGodP they areconscious


XIV PREFACE
ofnoimpropriety inaddressing the intervening
matter toastring ofHindu Divinities, Demons,
Ghosts, andNature Spirits, with afewAngels and
Prophets thrown in,astheoccasion mayseem to
require. Still, themore highly educated Malays,
especially thosewho live inthetowns andcome into
direct contact withArab teachers ofreligion, are
disposed toobject strongly tothese“relics ofpagan-
ism”
;andthere canbenodoubt thattheincreasing
diffusion ofgeneral education inthePeninsula is
contributing tothegrowth ofastricter conception
ofIslam, which willinvolve thegradual suppression
ofsuch ofthese old-world superstitions asareob-
viously ofan“unorthodox” character.
This process, however, willtake several genera-
tions toaccomplish, and inthemeantime itistobe
hoped thatacomplete record willhave beenmade
both ofwhat isdoomed sooner orlater toperish,
andofwhat inalllikelihood willsurvive under the
new conditions ofourtime. Itisasacontribution
tosuch arecord, and asacollection ofmaterials
toserve asasound basis forfurther additions and
comparisons, that thiswork isoffered tothereader.
Alistoftheprincipal authorities referred towill
befound inanother place, but itwould beimproper
toomit here theacknowledgments which aredue
tothevarious authors ofwhose work inthis field
such wide usehasbeen made. Among thedead
special mention must bemade ofMarsden, who will


PREFACE XV
always beforEnglishmen thepioneer ofMalay
studies;Leyden, thegifted translator oftheSe-
jarah Malayu, whose early death probably inflicted
onOriental scholarship thegreatest loss ithasever
had tosuffer;Newbold, theauthor ofwhat isstill,
onthewhole, thebestwork ontheMalay Peninsula;
andSirWilliam Maxwell, inwhom those ofuswho
knew himhave lostafriend, andMalay scholarship
athoroughly sound andmost brilliant exponent.
Among the living, theacknowledgments ofthe
author aredue principally toSirFrank Swetten-
hamandMr.Hugh Clifford, who, while theyhave
donemuch topopularise theknowledge ofthings
Malay amongst thegeneral reading public, have
alsoembodied intheir works theresults ofmuch
careful and accurate observation. The free use
which hasbeenmade ofthewritings ofthese and
other authors will, itishoped, beheld tobejustified
bytheir intrinsic value.
Itmustbeadded that theauthor, having toleave
England about thebeginning ofthisyear with the
Cambridge scientific expedition which isnowexplor-
ingtheNorthern States ofthePeninsula, leftthe
work withmeforrevision. The first fiveChapters
andChapter VI.,uptotheend ofthesection on
Dances, Sports, andGames, were then already in
the printer’s hands, butonly the firstioopages or
sohadhadthebenefit oftheauthor’s revision. For
thearrangement oftherestofChapter VI.,and for


XVI PREFACE
some small portion ofthematter therein contained,
Iamresponsible, and ithasalsobeenmyduty to
revise thewhole book finally. Accordingly, itis
only fair totheauthor topoint outthathe istobe
credited with thematter andthegeneral scheme of
thework, while theresponsibility fordefects indetail
must fallupon myself.
Asregards thespelling ofMalay words, itmust
besaid thatgeographical names have been spelled
inthewaywhich isnow usually adopted andwithout
diacritical marks :thenames oftheprincipal Native
States ofthePeninsula (most ofwhich arerepeatedly
mentioned inthebook) areKedah, Perak, Selangor,
Johor, Pahang, Trengganu, Kelantan, and Patani.
Otherwise, except inquotations (where thespelling
oftheoriginal ispreserved), anattempt hasbeen
made totransliterate theMalay w’ords found inthe
body ofthebook insuch away astogive the
ordinary reader afairly correct idea oftheir pro-
nunciation. The Appendix, which appeals only to
persons who already know Malay, hasbeen some-
what differently treated, diacritical marks being in-
serted only incases where there was apossible
ambiguity, and thespelling ofthe original MSS.
being changed aslittle aspossible.
Aperfect transliteration, orone that will suit
everybody, is,however, anunattainable ideal, and
themost thatcanbedone inthat direction isneces-
sarily acompromise. Inthesystem adopted inthe


PREFACE xvn
body ofthework, thevowels are tobesounded
(roughly speaking) asinItalian, except e(which
resembles theFrench einque,le>andthe like), and
theconsonants asinEnglish (butngasinsinger,
notfinger;gasingo;nyasniinonion;chasin
chiirch;finalkand initial halmost inaudible). The
symbol‘represents theArabic‘ain,andthesymbol’
isused (i)between consonants, toindicate thepres-
ence ofanalmost inaudible vowel, theshortest form
ofe,andelsewhere(2)forthehamzah,and(3)for
theapostrophe, i.e.todenote thesuppression ofa
letter orsyllable. Both thelainand thehamzah
maybeneglected inpronunciation, asindeed they
arevery generally disregarded bytheMalays them-
selves. Inthisandother respects, Arabic scholars
intowhose hands thisbookmay fallmust notbe
surprised tofind thatArabic words and phrases
suffer some corruptions inaMalay context. These
have not, asarule, been interfered with orcor-
rected, although ithas notbeen thought worth
while topreserve obvious blunders ofspelling in
well-known Arabic formulae. Itshould beadded
that inMalay theaccent orstress, which isless
marked than inEnglish, falls almost invariably on
thepenultimate syllable oftheword. Exceptions to
this rulehardly ever occur except inthefewcases
where thepenultimate isanopen syllable with ashort
vowel, asindicated bythesign\
