(a)Creation ofMan
Acommon feature inMalay romances andlegends
isadescription ofthesupernatural development ofa
young child intheinterior ofsome vegetable produc-
tion, usually abamboo.
SirW.E.Maxwell haspointed outthefactofthe
existence, both inMalay andJapanese legends, ofthe
main features ofthis story, towhich heassigns a
Buddhistic origin. He tellsthestory asfollows:—
“TheRaja oftheBamboo.—Some years ago I
collected anumber oflegends current among Malayan
tribes having astheir principal incident thesupernatural
development ofaprince, princess, ordemi-god inthe
stem ofabamboo, ortree, ortheinterior ofsome
closed receptacle .1
Iomitted, however, tomention
that thisvery characteristic Malay myth occurs inthe
“SriRama,” aMalay prose hikayat,2which, asits

The sitehaving beenfound andcleared, thenarrative
proceeds asfollows:—
“‘Now there wasaclump ofthebetong2bamboo

Imyself have heard among theSelangor Malays
similar legends totheabove, which, asalready pointed
out,arecommon inMalay romances. Aparallel myth
isdescribed inthefollowing words:—
“Now, thePerak river overflows itsbanks once a
year, andsometimes there arevery great floods.
Soon after themarriage ofNakhodah Kasim with
thewhiteSemang,2anunprecedented flood occurred
andquantities offoamcamedown the river. Round
