CHAPTER III
Relations with theSupernatural World
(a)TheMagician
“The accredited intermediary between men and
spirits isthePawangpthePawang isafunctionary of
great and traditional importance inaMalay village,
though inplaces neartowns theoffice isfalling into
abeyance. Inthe inland districts, however, the
Pawang isstill apower, and isregarded aspart
oftheconstituted order ofsociety, without whom no
village community would becomplete. Itmust be
clearly understood thathehasnothing whatever todo
with theofficial Muhammadan religion ofthemosque;
thevillage has itsregular staff ofelders—theImam,
Khatib, andBilal—forthemosque service. Butthe
Pawang isquite outside thissystem, andbelongs toa
different andmuch older order ofideas;hemaybe
regarded asthelegitimate representative oftheprimi-
tive‘medicine -man’or‘village -sorcerer,’ and his
very existence inthese days isananomaly, though it
does notstrike Malays assuch.
1“The titlesPawang andBomor are TheBomor usually practise their art
given bytheMalays totheir medicine forthecure ofhuman disease. Both
men. ThePawang classperform magic terms are,however, often used asthough
practices inorder tofind ore,medicine theywere interchangeable.” —Clifford,

CHAP. Ill THEMALAYMAGICIAN 57
‘‘Very often theoffice ishereditary, oratleast the
appointment ispractically confined tothemembers of
one family. Sometimes itisendowed with certain
‘properties’handed down from onePawang tohis
successor, known asthekabesaran,or,as itwere,
regalia. Ononeoccasion Iwasnearly called upon to
decide whether these adjuncts—which consisted, in
thisparticular case, ofapeculiar kind ofhead-dress—
were thepersonal property oftheperson then inpos-
session ofthem(whohadgotthem from hisfather, a
deceased Pawang),orwere toberegarded asofficial
insignia descending with theoffice intheevent ofthe
natural heir declining toserve !Fortunately Iwas
spared thedifficult taskofdeciding thisdelicate point
oflaw,as Imanaged topersuade theowner totakeup
theappointment.
“Butquite apart from such external marks ofdig-
nity, thePawang isaperson ofvery real significance.
Inallagricultural operations, such assowing, reaping,
irrigation works, andtheclearing ofjungle forplant-
ing, infishing atsea, inprospecting forminerals, and
incases ofsickness, hisassistance isinvoked. He is
entitled bycustom tocertain small fees;thus, after a
good harvest he isallowed, insome villages, five
gantangs ofpadi,onegantang ofrice(beras),andtwo
chupaks ofemping (apreparation ofriceandcocoa-nut
made intoasortofsweetmeat) fromeach householder.
After recovery from sickness hisremuneration isthe
verymodest amount oftigawang baharu,that is,7J
cents.
“It isgenerally believed thatagood harvest can
onlybesecured bycomplying with hisinstructions,
which areofapeculiar andcomprehensive character.

known aspantang. Thus, forinstance, itispantang in
some places towork intherice-field onthe14thand
15thdays ofthelunarmonth;and thisruleofenforced
idleness, being verycongenial totheMalay character,
is, Ibelieve, pretty strictly observed.
“Again, inreaping, certain instruments arepro-
scribed, and intheinland villages itisregarded asa
great crime tousethesickle(sabit)forcutting the
padi;

which cuts onlyanearortwo atatime. Also the
padimust notbethreshed byhitting itagainst thein-
sideofabox,apractice known asbanting padi.
“In this, asinoneortwoother cases, itmaybe
supposed that thePawang sordinances preserve the
older forms ofprocedure andareopposed toinnova-
tions inagricultural methods. Thesame istrue of
thepantang {i.e.taboo) rulewhich prescribes afixed
rateofprice atwhich padimaybesold inthevillage
community tomembers ofthesame village. This
system ofcustomary prices isprobably avery oldrelic
ofatimewhen theidea ofasking aneighbour ora
member ofyourown tribe topayacompetition price

munal rights. Itapplies toafewother articles of
local produce1besides padi, and Iwasfrequently as-

sured thattheneglect ofthiswholesome rulewasthe
cause ofbad harvests. Iwasaccordingly pressed to
fine transgressors, which would perhaps have been a
somewhat difficult thing todo.The fact,however,
that inmany places these rules aregenerally observed
isatribute totheinfluence ofthePawang wholends
hissanction tothem.”1
“ThePawang keeps afamiliar spirit, which inhis
case isahantu piisaka,that is,anhereditary spirit
which runs inthefamily, invirtue ofwhich heisable
todealsummarily with thewild spirits ofanobnoxious
character.”2
The foregoing description issoprecise andclear
that Ihave notmuch toadd to it.There are,how-
ever,oneortwopoints which require emphasis. One
ofthese isthatthepriestly magician stands incertain
respects onthesame footing asthedivine man or
king—that istosay,heowns certain insignia which are
exactly analogous totheregalia ofthelatter, and are,
asMr.Blagden points out,called bythesamename
(kabesaran ).Heshares, moreover, with theking the
right tomake useofclothdyed with theroyal colour
(yellow), and, liketheking, too,possesses theright to
enforce theuseofcertain ceremonial words andphrases,
inwhich respect, indeed, hislist islonger, ifanything,
than thatofroyalty.
Healso acts asasortofspirit-medium andgives
oracles intrances

fluence
;practises (very occasional) austerities;observes
some degree ofchastity, andappears quite sincere in
hisconviction ofhisownpowers. Atleasthealways

inability todowhatever isrequired. Anagedmagician
whocame from Perak todoctor oneofH.H. the
Sultan’s sons(Raja Kahar) while Iwas atLangat, had
theunusual reputation ofbeing able toraise asand-
bank intheseaatwill
;butwhen Iasked ifIcould see
itdone, heexplained that itcould onlybedone intime
ofwarwhen hewashard pressed byanenemy’s boat,
andhecould notdo itforthesake ofmere ostentation !
Moreover, likemembers oftheir profession allthe
world over, these medicine-men are,perhaps naturally,
extremely reticent;itwasseldom thattheywould let
their books beseen,much less copied, even forfair
payment, andaPawang once refused totellmea
charm until Ihadtakenmyshoes offandwasseated
withhimupon ayellow cloth while herepeated the
much-prized formula.
The office ofmagician is,ashasbeen said,very
often hereditary. Itisnotsoalways, however, there
being certain recognised ways inwhich amanmay
“get magic.” Oneofthemost peculiar isasfollows :
“To obtain magical powers (‘e/mu)youmustmeet the
ghost ofamurdered man. Take themidrib ofaleaf
ofthe‘ivory’cocoa-nut palm(pelepah niyor gading),
which istobelaidonthegrave, andtwomore midribs,

15thdayofthelunarmonth) when itfallsupon aTues-
day. Then take acent’s worth ofincense, with
glowing embers inacenser, and carry them tothe
head-post ofthegrave ofthedeceased. Fumigate
thegrave, going three times round it,and callupon
themurdered manbyname:—

‘Hearken, So-and-so,

Here take the firstmidrib, fumigate it,andlay itupon
thehead ofthegrave, repeating1KurAllah ’(‘Cluck,

youmust address thesame request asbefore.”
(b)High Places
“Although officially thereligious centre ofthe
village community isthemosque, there isusually
inevery small district aholy placeknown asthe
kramat,2atwhich vows arepaidonspecial occasions,
andwhich isinvested with avery high degree of
reverence andsanctity.
1TheMalay version runs :—
iiHeiangkau SiAnu,
Tolong-lah aku
Akubawakcm kapada aulia Allah,
Aku ’nakminlalelmu sadikit.”
Thismethod ofgetting magic isan
exact transcription ofthewords in
which itwasdictated tomebyaKel-
antan Malay (’Che ‘Abas) then residing
atKlanang inSelangor.
2Cp.Mr.G.C.Bellamy inSelangor
Journal,vol. ii.No. 6,p.90,who
says :“Theword kramat,asapplied
toaman orwoman, mayberoughly
translated prophet ormagician. Itis
difficult toconvey thereal idea, as
Malays callamankramat who isabletogetwhatever hewishes for,who is
able toforetell events, andwhose
presence brings good fortune toallhis
surroundings. District officers willbe
proud toknow that inthis lastsense
theword isoccasionally applied to
them. When thename kramat is
applied toaplace, Iunderstand itto
mean aholy place, aplace ofpilgrim-
age;but itdoes notnecessarily mean
agrave, asmany people think. Ican
quote thekramat atBatuAmpar, Jugra,
andnumerous places onriver banks
where nograves exist, butyetthey are
called kramat s.”[There is,however,
atradition that asaint’s legwas
buried atBatuHampar!—W.S.]


62 RELATIONS WITHTHESUPERNATURAL chap.
“These kramats abound inMalacca territory
;there
ishardly avillage butcanboastsometwoorthree in
itsimmediate neighbourhood, andthey areperfectly
wellknown toalltheinhabitants.
“Theoretically, kramats aresupposed tobethe
graves ofdeceased holymen, theearly apostles ofthe
Muhammadan faith, the firstfounders ofthevillage
whocleared theprimeval jungle, orother persons of
local notoriety inaformer age;andthere isnodoubt
thatmany ofthem arethatandnothing more. But
even so,thereverence paid tothemandtheceremonies
thatareperformed atthem savour agood deal too
much ofancestor-worship tobeattributable toan
orthodox Muhammadan origin.
“Itiscertain, however, thatmany ofthese kramats
arenotgraves atall :many ofthem areinthejungle,
onhillsand ingroves, likethehigh places oftheOld
Testament idolatries;they contain notrace ofagrave
(while those that arefound invillages usually have
grave-stones), andthey appear tobereally ancient
sites ofaprimitive nature-worship ortheadoration of
thespirits ofnatural objects.
“Malays, when asked toaccount forthem, often
have recourse totheexplanations thatthey arekramat
jin,that is,“spirit ’’-places;and ifaMalay ispressed
onthepoint, andthinks that theorthodoxy ofthese
practices isbeing impugned, hewillsometimes addthat
the/m inquestion isajin islam,aMuhammadan and
quite orthodox spirit!
“Thus onBukit Nyalas, near theJohol frontier,
there isakramat consisting ofagroup ofgranite
boulders onaledge ofrockoverhanging asheer descent
ofagoodmany feet;bamboo clumps grow onthe
place, andthere were traces ofreligious riteshaving

beenperformed there, butnograve whatever. This
placewasexplained tometobethekramat ofone
Nakhoda Hussin, described asajin(oftheorthodox
variety), whopresides over thewater, rain,andstreams.
People occasionally burned incense there toavert
drought andgetenough water forirrigating their
fields. There wasanother kramat ofhislowerdown
the hill, also consisting ofrocks, oneofwhich was
shaped something likeaboat. Iwasinformed that
thisjin isattended bytigers which guard the hill,and
arevery jealous oftheintrusion ofother tigers from
thesurrounding country. He isbelieved tohave
revealed himself totheoriginal Pawang ofthevillage,
themythical founder ofthekampong ofNyalas. Ina
case like this itseems probable thatthename attached
tothisobject ofreverence isalater accretion, andthat
under athindisguise wehave here arelicofthewor-
ship ofthe spirit ofrivers and streams, asort of
elemental deity localised inthis particular place, and
stillregarded asaproper object ofworship andpro-
pitiation, inspite ofthetheoretically strictmonotheism
oftheMuhammadan creed. Again, atanother place
thekramat isnothing butatree,ofsomewhat singular
shape, having alarge swelling somewayupthetrunk.
Itwasexplained tomethat thistreewasconnected in
aspecial waywith theprospects oflocal agriculture,
thesizeoftheswelling increasing ingood years and
diminishing inbadseasons !Hence itwas naturally
regarded withconsiderable awebythepurely agricul-
tural population oftheneighbourhood.
“Asmaybeimagined, itisexceedingly difficult to
discover anyauthentic facts regarding thehistory of
these numerous kramats:

andoften even that isforgotten. Themost celebrated

manwho thinks nothing ofperjuring himself inthe
witness-box, andwhomight notmuch mind telling a
lieeven with theKoran onhishead, willflinch before
theordeal ofafalsehood inthepresence oftheDato’
Machap.”1
After explaining thedifference between beneficent
spirits andthespirits ofevil,Mr.Blagden continues :
“Some timeagooneofthese objectionable hantus
(spirits ofevil)hadsettled down inakerayong tree in
themiddle ofthisvillage ofBukit Senggeh, andused
tofrighten people whopassed thatway inthedusk;
sothePawang wasduly called upon toexorcise it,and
under hissuperintendence thetreewascutdown, after
which there wasnomore trouble. But itiscertain
that itwould have been excessively dangerous foran

“This pointmaybeillustrated byacasewhich was
reported tomesoon after itoccurred, andwhich again
shows theintimate connection ofspirits with trees.

“Inmany places there aretreeswhich arepretty
generally believed tobetheabodes ofspirits, andnot
oneMalay intenwould venture tocutonedown,
while most people would hardly dare togonearone

gent Malay, withwhom Iwasdiscussing theterms on
which heproposed totakeupacontract forclearing
thebanks ofariver,made itanabsolute condition that
heshould notbecompelled tocutdown aparticular
treewhich overhung thestream, ontheground that it
wasa‘spirit’tree. That treehad tobeexcluded
from thecontract.”1
Thefollowing description, bySirW.Maxwell, ofa
Perak kramat maybetaken asfairly typical ofthe
kramat,inwhich there really isagrave:—
“Rightly orwrongly theMalays ofLarut assign
anAchinese origin toanoldgrave which was dis-
covered intheforest some years ago,andofwhich I
propose togive abrief description. Itissituated
about half-way between theLarut Residency andthe
mining village ofKamunting. Intheneighbourhood

“The Malays ofJavawere ablefrom thevillage
tradition togive thename andsexoftheoccupant of
this lonely tomb,‘Toh Bidan Susu Lanjut/ whose

translation. She issaid tohavebeenanoldAchinese

Itisawell-known Malay superstition that thestones

increase their relative distance during thelapse of

a
Malay will oftenvow that ifhesucceeds insome

who visitakramat intimes ofdistress ordifficulty, to
prayand tovow offerings, incase their prayers are
granted, usually leave behind them astokens oftheir
vows small pieces ofwhite cloth, which aretied to
thebranches ofatree ortosticks planted inthe
ground near thesacred spot. Forvotary purposes
thelong-forgotten tomb ofTohBidan Susu Lanjut

Mr.George Bellamy, writing in1893, thusdescribed
the.kramat atTanjong Karang intheKuala Selangor
district:—

“Thekramat about which Iamnowwriting isa
veryremarkable one. Itissituated ontheextreme
point ofland atthemouth oftheriver Selangor, close
towhere thenew lighthouse hasbeen erected. A
magnificent kayu ara (akind offig-tree) forms a
prominent feature ofthetanjong (point orcape), and
atthebase ofthis tree, enveloped entirely by its
roots, isanoblong-shaped space having theappear-
ance ofaMalay grave, with theheadstones complete.
....Tothissacred spot constant pilgrimages are
made bytheMalays, andthelower branches ofthe
treerarely lackthose pieces ofwhite andyellow cloth
which arealways hung upasanindication thatsome
devout person haspaid hisvows. TheChinese also
have great respect forthiskramat,andhave erected
asortofsylvan temple atthefootofthetree.” Mr.
Bellamy tellshowoneRaja ‘Abdullah fell inlove
with amaiden named Miriam, whodisappeared and
wassupposed tohave been taken bythe spirits
(though shewas really carried offbyanearlier lover
named Hassan). Raja ‘Abdullah diedandwasburied
atthefootofthe fig-tree. Mr.Bellamy concludes :
“Ifyoueverhappen toseeavery bigcrocodile at

Abdullah.”1
InNo. 2ofthesame volume oftheSelangor
Journal Bellamy refers toanother kramat—thatof
’Toh Ketapang—which heappears tolocalise inUlu
Selangor.
Itisbynomeans necessary toensure thepopu-
larity ofakramat orshrine that thesaint towhose
memory itisdedicated should beaMalay. The
cosmopolitan character ofthese shrines isattested in
thefollowing notewhich Isent totheSelangor Jour-
nal2about theshrines intheUluLangat (Kajang)
district ofSelangor:—
“The chief kramats inthe district are‘Makam
’TohSayah’(thetomb ofaJavanese ofhigh repute);
‘Makam Said Idris,’ atRekoh, Said Idris being the
father ofthePenghulu ofCheras;‘Makam ’Toh
Janggut (a‘Kampar’ man), ontheroad toCheras;
and‘Makam ’TohGerdu orBerdu,’ atDusun Tua,
UluLangat. ’TohBerdu wasofSakai origin.”
Ihave never yet,however, heard ofanyshrine
being dedicated toaChinaman, and itisprobable
that thisspecies ofcanonisation isconfined (atleast
inmodern times) tolocal celebrities professing the
Muhammadan religion, aswould certainly bethecase
oftheMalays andJavanese mentioned inthe fore-
going paragraph, andquite possibly toointhecaseof
theSakai.
Itistrue thatChinese often worship atthese
shrines—just as,onthesame principle, theyemploy
Malay magicians inprospecting for tin;butthere
appear tobecertain limits beyond which they

cannot go,as itwas related tomewhen Iwas
living intheneighbourhood, that aChinaman who
had, intheinnocence ofhis heart, offered ata
Moslem shrine apiece oftheaccursed pork,was
pounced upon and slain before hereached home by
oneofthetigers which guarded theshrine.
Theshrine of’TohKamarong isoneofthemost
celebrated shrines intheLangat district, the saint’s
lastresting-place being guarded byawhite elephant
andawhite tiger, thelatter ofwhich hadbeen apet
(pemainan)ofhisduring hislifetime. Inthisrespect
itisexactly similar totheshrine of’Toh Parwi of
Pantei inSungei Ujong, which issimilarly guarded,
both shrines having been erected ontheseashore, itis
said, inthedayswhen theseacamemuch farther inland
than itdoes atpresent. Thefame of’TohKamarong
filled theneighbourhood, and itisrelated thaton
oneoccasion aniratemother exclaimed, ofasonof
herswhowasremarkable forhisvicious habits, “May
the’Toh Kramat Kamarong flyaway with him.”
Next daytheboydisappeared, and allsearch proved
fruitless, until three days later ’Toh Kamarong
appeared toher inadream, andinformed herthat
hehadcarried theboy off,asshehadinvited him to
do,and that ifshewere tolook forhisfootprints she
would beable todiscover them inside thepad-tracks
ofatigeroneofwhose feetwassmaller than therest,
andwhich wasthenhaunting thespot. Shedidso,
anddiscovered her son’s footprints exactly asthe
saint hadforetold. This Ghost-tiger, which nodoubt
must beidentified with’TohKamarong’s “pet,” used
toroam the district when Iwas stationed inthe
neighbourhood, andboth Iand, Ibelieve, thethen

smaller than therest. This curious feature isthought
bythelocalMalays atleast, tobeoneofthespeci-
allydistinctive marks ofarimau kramat,orGhost-
tiger, just asthepossession ofonetusk that is
smaller than theother isthemark ofaGhost-
elephant.1
Closely connected with thesubject ofshrines isthat
ofhigh places, such asthose spots where religious
penance was traditionally practised. One ofthese
sacred spots issaid tohave been situated upon
the“Mount Ophir” ofMalacca, which isabout 4000
feethigh, andonwhich acertain legendary Princess
known asTuan PutriGunong Ledang issaid tohave
dwelt, untilshetransferred herghostly court toJugra
Hill,upon thecoast ofSelangor.2
Such fasting-places areusually, asinJava, either
solitary hills orplaces which present some great
natural peculiarity;even remarkable trees androcks
being, ashasalready been pointed out,pressed into
theservice ofthisMalay “natural religion.”
(c)Nature ofRites
Themain divisions ofthemagico- religious cere-
monies oftheMalays areprayer, sacrifice, lustration,
fasting, divination, andpossession.
Prayer, which isdefined byProfessor Tylor as“a
request made toadeity asifhewere aman,” isstill

foranything butpersonal advantages ofamaterial
character being ever, sofaras Iamaware, preferred
bytheworshipper. The efficacy ofprayer is,how-
ever, often supposed tobeenhanced byrepetition.
“Asprayer isarequest made toadeity asifhe
were aman, sosacrifice isagiftmade toadeity as
ifhewere aman The ruder conception
that thedeity takes andvalues theoffering for itself,
gives place, ontheonehand, totheidea ofmere
homage asexpressed byagift,and,ontheother, to
thenegative view thatthevirtue liesintheworshipper
depriving himself ofsomething prized.”1
Ageneral survey ofthecharms andceremonies
brought together inthisvolume will, Ithink, belikely
toestablish theview that theMalays (inaccordance
with thereported practice ofmany other races) prob-
ablycommenced with the idea ofsacrifice asa
simple gift,andtherefrom developed first theidea
ofceremonial homage, and later theidea ofsacrifice
asanactofabnegation. Evidences oftheoriginal
gift-theory chiefly survive inthelanguage ofcharms,
inwhich thedeity appealed toisrepeatedly invited
toeatanddrink oftheofferings placed before him,
asamaster maybeinvited toeatbyhisservants.
The intermediate stage between thegiftandhomage
theories ismarked byanextensive useof“sub-
stitutes,” andofthe sacrifice ofapart orparts for
thewhole. Thusweeven find thedough model
ofahuman being actually called “the substitute”
