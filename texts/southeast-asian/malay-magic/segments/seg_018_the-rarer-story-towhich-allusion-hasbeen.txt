wasthefollowing:—
“There wasawoman whohadachildwhich had

gave thename of‘Sarilang.’ Onedayshetook the
child totheriver-side inorder tobathe it,butduring
thelatter operation itslipped from hergrasp and fell
intotheriver. Themother shrieked andwept, butas
shedidnotknowhow todiveshehadtoreturn home
without herchild. That night shedreamed adream,
inwhich herchild appeared andsaid,‘Weep nomore,
mother, Ihave turned into acrocodile, andamnow
called‘Grandsire Sarilang’ (’Toh Sarilang) :ifyou
would meet me,come to-morrow tothespotwhere
you lostme.’ Next morning, therefore, themother
repaired totheriverandcalled upon thename ofher
child, whereupon herchild rose tothesurface, andshe
saw thatfrom thewaist downwards hehadalready
turned into acrocodile, though hewas stillhuman
down tothewaist. Now thechild said,‘Come back
again after fourteen days, andremember tobring an
eggandaplantain (banana).’ She therefore went

shegavehimtheeggandtheplantain, andhedevoured
them, andwhen hehaddone sohesaid,‘Whenever

The notes oncrocodile folklore which willnowbe
given were reprinted intheSelangor Journal from the
“PerakMuseum Notes”ofMr.Wray.

dragging itspreyunder water. Crocodiles inhabiting
ariver aresaid toresent theintrusion ofstrangers
from other waters, andfights often take place incon-
sequence. According totheMalays they aregifted
with two pairs ofeyes. Theupper ones they use
when above water, andtheunder pairwhen beneath
thesurface. This latter pair issituated half-way be-
tween themuzzle andtheangle ofthemouth, onthe
under surface ofthelower jaw. These areinreality
noteyes, butinward folds ofskinconnected byaduct
with ascent gland, which secretes anunctuous sub-
stance ofadark gray colour, with astrong musky
odour. Medicinal properties areattributed tothe
flesh ofthemales, which arebelieved tobeofvery
rare occurrence, and tobequite unable toleave the
water byreason oftheir peculiar conformation. The
fact isthat thesexes arealmost undistinguishable,
except ondissection, andtherefore thenatives class all
thatarecaught asfemales. While onthis subject, it
maybeworth mentioning that atPortWeld there
used tobeatame crocodile which would comewhen
called. TheMalays fed itregularly, and said itwas
not vicious, andwould notdoanyharm. Itwas
repeatedly seenbytheyearly visitants toPortWeld,
orSapetang, astheplacewasthen called, andwas a
finebiganimal, withabunch ofseaweed growing on
itshead. Some onehad itcalled, andthen fired atthe
poor thing;whether itwaswounded oronlyfrightened
isuncertain, but itnever came again.”1
Thefollowing notes upon thesame subject were
collected bymeinSelangor:—
The female crocodile commonly builds her nest,
with orwithout theaidofthemale,among thethorny

clumps oflempiei (ordempiei)trees just above
high-water mark, using thefallen leaves toform the
nest,andbreaking upthetwigs withhermouth. The
season forlaying issaid, inthenorth ofthePeninsula,
tocoincide with thetime“when therice-stalks swell
with thegrain,” i.e.theendofthewetseason.
Themost prolific species ofcrocodile isreputed
tobethebuaya lubok,orBight crocodile (also called
buaya rawang,orMarsh crocodile), which lays as
many asfifty orsixty eggs inasingle nest. Other
varieties, Imay add, arethebuaya tembaga (Copper
crocodile), thebuaya katak (Dwarf crocodile), which
is,asitsname implies, “short and stout,” andthe
buaya hitam orbest(Black orIron crocodile), which is
reported toattain alarger sizethananyother variety.
This latter kind isoften moss-grown, and ishence
called buaya berlumut (Mossy crocodile). The largest
specimen ofthis variety ofwhich Ihave hadany
reliable account isonewhich measured “fourfathoms,
lessonehasta ”(about 23feet), andwhich wascaught
inthetime ofSultan Mahmat atSungei Sembilang,
nearKuala Selangor, byoneNakhoda Kutib.
The buaya jolong-jolong,which has attracted
attention owing toitsreputed identification with the
gavial ofIndian waters, andwhich istherefore no
true crocodile, ispointedly described byMalays as
separating itselffrom theother species.
Finally, there isthebuaya gulong tenun (the
“Crocodile thatRolls uptheWeft” ?),which isnot,
however, thename ofaseparate variety, but isthe
name applied totheYoung Person orNewWoman of
theworld ofcrocodile-folk —theaggressive female who
“snaps”ateverything andeverybody forthemere
glory ofthesnap!’


V HABITS OFTHECROCODILE 289
‘‘After hatching,” says Mr.Wray, “the mother
watches, and . . .eatsup allthose which runaway
from thewater, butshould anyescape herandget
away ontotheland they will turn into tigers.”
There isperhaps more point intheSelangor tradition,
according towhich the little runaways turn, notinto
tigers, butinto “iguanas ”(Monitor lizards).
Asregards thewant ofatongue, which issupposed
tobecommon toallcrocodiles, itissaidtheywere so
created bydesign, inorder thattheymight notacquire
toopronounced a“taste” forhuman flesh. Hence
theproverb which declares thatnocarrion istoobad
forthem towelcome :“Buaya mana tahu menolak
bangkei?”(“When willcrocodiles refuse corpses?”)1
After theoutbreak offerocity(ganas)among the
crocodiles intheKlang River lastyear,some account
oftheway inwhich thecrocodile ishere said tocapture
anddestroy hishuman victims mayprove ofinterest.
Every crocodile has,according totheSelangor
Malay, three setsoffangs, which arenamed asfollows :
(1)sihampa daya*(two above andtwo below), at
thetipofthejaws
;(2)entah-entah (two intheupper
andtwo inthelower jaw), half-way up
;(3)charik
kapan (two intheupper andtwo inthelower jaw),
near thesocket ofthejaws.
The firstmaybetranslated by“Exhaust your
devices”
;thesecond by“Yesorno”
;andthethird
by“Tear theshroud,” thelatter being areference to
theselvage which, among theMalays, istorn offthe

Ifaman iscaught bythe “Exhausters ofall
Resources,” hehasafairchance ofescape;ifcaught
bythe“Debateable”teeth hisescape isdecidedly
problematical;but ifcaught bythe“Tearers ofthe
Shroud,” he istoallintents andpurposes adead
man. Whenever iteffects acapture thecrocodile
carries itsvictim atoncebelow thesurface, andeither
tries tosmother him inthe soft,thickmud oftheman-
grove swamp, orpushes himunder asnag orprojecting
root, with theobject ofletting himdrown, while it
retires towatch himfrom ashort distance. After
what itconsiders asufficient interval toeffect itspur-
pose, thecrocodile seizes thebody ofthedrowned man
and rises tothesurface, when it“callsupon theSun,
Moon, andStars tobearwitness”that itwasnotguilty
ofthehomicide—
“Bukan akumembunoh angkau^
Ayeryangmembunoh angkau.”
Which, being translated, means—
“Itwasnot Iwho killed you,
Itwaswater which killed you.”1
After thrice repeating thisstrange performance,
thecrocodile again dives andproceeds toprepare the
corpse for itsprospective banquet. Embracing the
corpse with its“arms,” andcurving the tipofits

powerful tailunder itsown belly (until the tail isnearly
bent double), itcontrives tobreak thebackbone ofthe
victim, andthenpicking upthebody oncemore with
itsteeth, dashes itviolently against atrunk orroot in
order tobreak thelongbones ofthelimbs. When
thebones arethussobroken astooffernoobstruction,
itswallows thebody whole—thus affording aremark-
able parallel totheboa initsmethod ofdevouring its
prey, and recalling Darwinian ideas oftheir cousin-
hood. Miraculous escapes have, however, occasionally
occurred. Thus Lebai ‘Aliwascaught byacrocodile
atBatuBurok (Kuala Selangor), oneevening asthe
tidewasebbing, andthecrocodile, after smothering
him effectually (as itthought) inthethickmud, retired
toawait theend. Insensibly, however, itfloated
farther and farther offwith thefalling tide,andLebai
‘Ali,seeing hisopportunity, made aboldandsuccessful
dash forfreedom.
Asimilar casewasthatofSiKa’,whowaspushed
under abamboo rootontheriverbank bythecroco-
dilewhich caught him,andwho, after waiting tillhis
formidable enemy hadfloated alittle farther offthan
usual, drew himself upbyanoverhanging stem and
swarmed up it.Atthesamemoment thecrocodile
made arush,andactually caught himbythegreat toe,
which latter, however, hewillingly surrendered tohis
enemy astheprice ofhisliberty.
Ayetmore marvellous escape, was that of
theyouth belonging totheGovernment launch
atKlang, who escaped, itisrelated, bythetime-
honoured expedient ofputting histhumbs into the
crocodile’s eyes. Inconnection with this latter exploit,
bytheway,Malay authorities assert thatthecrocodile’s
eyesprotrude from their sockets onstalks (like those


292 REPTILES ANDREPTILE CHARMS CHAP.
ofacrab) solong ashestays under water, thestalks
being “aslong astheforefinger,” sothat itisquite
aneasy matter tocatch hold ofthese living
“pegs.”
Forthe rest, crocodiles aresaidbytheMalays to
have asort offalse stomach divided into several
pouches orsacs, onesacbeing forthestones which
they swallow, andanother fortheclothes andaccoutre-
ments oftheirhuman victims, these pouches being in
addition totheir realstomach (inwhich theremains of
monkeys, wild pig,mouse-deer, andother small animals
arefound), and, inthecase offemale specimens, the
ovary. Thesecond pair ofeyes intheneck which,
Mr.Wray says, they aresupposed tousewhen below
thesurface, areinSelangor supposed tobeused at
night, whence they arecalled matamalam,ornight-
eyes, asopposed totheir realeyeswhich they are
supposed touseonlybyday.
Asregards thestones, which crocodiles undoubtedly
swallow, they aresometimes supposed toenable each
male crocodile tokeep anaccount ofthenumber of
rivers which ithasentered, ofthenumber ofbights it
haslived in,oreven ofthenumber ofitshuman
victims. The noise which crocodiles makewhen fight-
ingresembles aloud roar orbellow, andtheMalays
apply thesame wordmenguak tothebellow ofthe
crocodile aswellastothatofthebuffalo.
Thewrath ofthecrocodile-folk isprovoked by
thosewho wish toshoot them, invarious ways, of
which, perhaps, thecommonest istodabble asarong;
or(as issaid tobemore effectual) awoman’s mosquito-
curtain, inthewater oftheriverwhere they live. So
also tokeep two setsofweights andmeasures (one
forbuying andanother forselling, asissometimes

donebytheChinese), issaid tobeacertain means of
provoking their indignation.
The crocodile-wizard issometimes credited with
thepower ofcalling thecrocodile-folk together, and
ofdiscovering aman-eater among them, andaneye-
witness lately described tomethescene ononesuch
occasion. AMalay hadbeen carried offanddevoured
byacrocodile atLarut, andaBatu Bara man,who
wentbythesobriquet ofNakhoda Hassan, undertook
todiscover theculprit. Sprinkling some oftheusual
sacrificial rice-paste (tepong tawar) and “saffron”
riceupon thesurface oftheriver, hecalled outinloud
tones tothevarious tribes ofcrocodiles intheriver,
andsummoned them toappear onthesurface. My
informant declares that not lessthan eight orten
crocodiles actually appeared, whereupon thePawang
commanded them alltoreturn tothebottom with the
exception oftheonewhich was guilty. Inafew
moments onlyonecrocodile remained onthesurface,
and thisone,onbeing forthwith killed andcutopen,
wasfound tocontain thegarments oftheunfortunate
manwhohadbeen captured by it.Similar stories of
theprowess ofcrocodile charmers are toldbythe
Javanese.1
Ishallnowproceed todescribe themethods and
ceremonies used forthecatching ofcrocodiles. The
following isadescription byMr.J.H.M.Robson, of
Selangor, ofthemost usual method, atallevents in
Selangor, but itwould appear from remarks upon
thesubject inDr.Denys’ work, that live aswell
asdead bait iscommonly used:—
“Asmall piece ofhardwood, about 6in.or8in.

bysayacouple ofknots, soastoprevent thecrocodile
from biting itthrough, asthestrands simply get
between histeeth;totheother endofthistwine is
fastened asingle uncut rattan, atleast 20feet long,
which canbeonly aquarter ofaninch indiameter,
butmay withadvantage bealittle bigger; asmall
stick affixed totheendofthe line, toactasavisible
float, completes this part ofthegear. Probably a
crocodile willeatanything, butheiscertainly partial
tochicken—atleast that bait isalways successful in
theSepang river—so,having killed some sortoffowl,
thebody iscutright through thebreast lengthways
fromhead totail,andthesmall piece ofpointed hard
wood inserted, andthebirdbound upagain with string.
Next, two pieces oflightwood arenailed together,
forming asmall floating platform about afootsquare,
andonthisthefowl isplaced, raised onminiature
trestles. The small platform thusfurnished isplaced
inalikely spot near thebank, andtherattan line is
hitched over asmall branch orastake, sothat the
baitplatform may notbecarried away bythe tide.
Bythenextmorning therattan line, baitandplatform
may allhave disappeared, which probably means that

with therattan intow,atugbeing sufficient toset it

onthelook-out fortherattan (which always floats),
finding itatlength close tothemangrove roots
bordering ontheriver, perhaps. Theboat-hook picks
upthefloating-stick endoftheline,and,with acouple
ofboatmen ontothisandacrocodile attheother end,
with thesmall pointed hardwood stick across his
throat, theexcitement begins. The crocodile plunges
about amidst themangrove roots under thewater, and
thenmakes arush;therattan ispaid outagain and
theboat follows;then herushes under the boat,
perhaps attheboat, whilst theline issteadily pulled
in.This sort ofthingmay lastsome time, butthe
onlything tobeafraid ofistherattan’s getting twisted
round abakau1root under water, which might
prevent acapture;otherwise, after agood deal of
playing ofarather violent nature, the continual
pulling oftherattan-holders intheboat, orhisown
aggressiveness, induces him toshow hishead above
thesurface, whereat the rifles crack, andthecrocodile
dies,though often not tillfourorfivebullets havebeen
putinto different parts ofhisbody.”2
Iwillnow proceed todescribe the religious
ceremonies which accompany thisperformance.
The following outline oftheceremonies used in
catching acrocodile who isknown tobeaman-eater,
wastaken down bymefrom themouth ofanoted

take strips ofbark ofariver-side bush ortreecalled

of itisthat theloose strands getbetween the
crocodile’s teeth, andprevent itfrom being bitten
through asaropewould certainly be.
Next, youtake apiece ofthebottommost rung of
ahouse-ladder (anak tangga bongsu), andsharpen it
toapoint atboth ends, soastoform across-piece
(fla/ang) such aswillbelikely tostick inthecrocodile’s
throat. Having fastened oneendofthe“gut” round
themiddle ofthecross-piece, andtheother toyour
rattan line,thelength ofwhichmaybefrom tentofifteen
fathoms orso,according tothedepth oftheriver at
thespotwhere thecrocodile issupposed tolie,you
must next cutdown ayoung tree toserve asthepole
(chanchang)towhich thefloating platform and bait
maybesubsequently attached. This polemaybeof
anykind ofwood except bamboo;sowhen youhave
found asuitable tree, takehold ofitwith the lefthand
andchop at itthrice with the right, saying acharm

Then startmaking thefloating platform orraft

intothree lengths(di-k'ratkan tiga),andthenskewering
these lengths together attheir ends soastoform a
triangle.
Intotheapex ofthistriangle firmly plant thelower

endcurve over slightly inaforward direction(di-pas-

itsposition bytwo lashings, which arecarried down

the triangle. Then utter thecharm and plant the
polebytheriver-side inthespotyouhave selected,
holding your breath andmaking believe thatyou
areKingSolomon(di-sifatkan kitaRaja Suleiman)as
itsinks into theground. Thecharm consists of
these lines:—
“Peace bewithyou,OProphet Khailir,

Now prepare the bait.Todothisyoumust killa

leaf,and attheend ofthe invocation eject the
chewed betel-leaf upon thehead ofthecock intended

Thecharm toberecited (which makes allusion
tothefable concerning thesupposed origin ofthe

V SNAKE LEGENDS 303
TheMalays call itulerkapak daun,andthey say
that itisfedthree times adaybybirds,who bring
itinsects toeat.Onemanwent sofarastosay
thathehad actually once seensome birds engaged
infeeding one ofthese beautiful bright -green
snakes.”1
InSelangor, asinPerak, the“live gall-bladder”
ofthepython will (itisbelieved), ifkept inajar,
develop into aserpent;when dried itisingreat
request asaremedy forsmall-pox. The story that
Mr.Wray tells ofthe pitviper(ularkapak daun) is
inSelangor told ofasnake called chintamani.
Selangor Malays saythat itwasonceupon atime
aRaja ofthecountry, and that thebirds which
bring itfoodwere then itssubjects. AMalay told
methatheoncesaw this operation, and that the
birds fed itwith insects. Itisreputed tobea
perfectly harmless snake, and itisconsidered ex-
tremely lucky tokeeponeofthespecies inone’s house,
oreven tosee it. Itisdescribed asofabright and
glittering blue2colour (bint berkilat-kilat),and is
frequently referred toincharms, especially those
connected with theRice-soul ceremony, and issome-
times said tospring from theeggofthechandra-
wasih orbirdofparadise.
Thecobra(ular tedong) issaid tohave abright
stone(kemala orgemald)3initshead, theradiance
ofwhich causes itshead tobevisible onthedarkest

tobeoccasionally found intheback ofasnake’s
head(?),whilst thesnake-stone (batu ular) iscarried
initsmouth.
This batu ular isaprize forthepossession of
which snakes arenotunfrequently believed tofight,
andappears tocorrespond tothepearl forwhich in
Chinese legendary lorethedragons ofthatcountry
were believed toengage inmortal combat. AMalay
remarked tomethat itwasalways worth while ifone
cameupontwosnakes thusengaged tokillthem both,
asoneofthemwassure topossess thismuch-coveted
stone, which issaid toconfer analmost certain victory
upon itspossessor.
Another species of‘‘snake-stone,” which issaid to
bemanufactured byPawangs from gold, silver,
amalgam (ofsilver andgold), tin,iron,andquicksilver,
iscalled Buntat Raksa,and issaid tobeinvaluable
incase ofsnake-bite. Itisbelieved that thisstone
willadhere tothewound, and willnot falloffuntil it
hassucked out allthepoison. One ofthese stones,
which was sold tome inSelangor foradollar,
wasabout aninch longandoval inshape; itwas
evidently made ofsome mixture ofmetals, andwas
perforated soastoenable ittobecarried ona

Theulargantang issaid tobeasnake, though from
thedescription given itwould seemmore likely tobe
some species ofslow-worm orblind-worm. Itisonly
a“few inches” long,and is“black,” andthere issaid
tobelittle ifanydifference between itsheadand its
tail. Itisconsidered tobeextremely lucky, andwhen
aMalay meets it,hespreads outhishead -cloth or
turban ontheground, andallows ittoenter,when he
carries ithome andkeeps it.


V IDEAS ABOUT TOADS 305
Todream ofbeing bitten byasnake isthought to
portend success inalove affair .1
“Ahorned toad,known askatak bertandok,but
notthecommon one ofthatname (Megalophrys
nasuta,Gunther), hasaverybadreputation with the
Malays. Itissaid tolive inthejungle onthe hills,
andwherever ittakes up itsabode allthetrees and
plants around wither and die.Sopoisonous isit,that
itisdangerous even toapproach it,andtotouch orbe
bitten by itiscertain death.
“The biteofthecommon toad[Bu/o melanostictus,
Cantor) isalso said toprove fatal. That toads have
noteeth isananatomical detail thatdoes notseem to
bethought worthy ofbeing taken intoaccount.
“Thesupposed venomous properties ofthis useful
andharmless tribe have aworld -wide range. In
Shakespeare many allusions to itaremade;oneof
them, which mentions thehabit ofhibernation pos-
sessed bythose species which inhabit thecolder parts
oftheearth, says—
‘Inthepoison’d entrails throw,
Toad, thatunder coldest stone
Daysandnights hast thirty-one,
Swelter’d venom sleeping got,
Boilthou first i’thecharmed pot.’
“In another, reference ismade tothetoad-stone,
which seems toberepresented inMalayan tradition
bythepearl carried inthebodies ofthehamadryad,
thecobra, andthebungarus, thethree most deadly
snakes ofthePeninsula:—
‘Sweet aretheuses ofadversity,
Which, likethetoad, uglyandvenomous,
Wears yetaprecious jewel initshead.’

“There issome foundation offactforthepopular
belief, astoads secret anacrid fluid from the skin,
which appears todefend them from theattacks ofcar-
nivorous animals.”1
Itmaynotbeoutofplace togivehere aMalay
tradition about aspecies ofsnail:—
“Astrange superstition isattached toasmall snail
which frequents theneighbourhood ofthelimestone
hills inPerak. Itbelongs totheCyclophorides,and
isprobably anAlycceus .Among thegrass inthe
shadow ofagrazing animal these creatures aretobe
discovered, and ifoneofthem iscrushed itwillbe
found tobefullofblood, which hasbeendrawn ina
mysterious wayfrom theveins oftheanimal through
itsshadow. Where these noxious snails abound, the
cattle become emaciated andsometimes even diefrom
theconstant loss ofblood. Inthefolklore ofother
countries many parallels tothisoccur, butthey differ
ineither thebirds, bats, orvampires, whoaresupposed
topreyonthelife-blood oftheir fellows, going direct
totheanimals tosuck theblood, instead ofdoing so

Fish are inmany cases credited bytheMalay

Cp. the following note inSale’s
Translation oftheKordn :—
“This miracle isthus related bythe
commentators. Jesus having, atthere-
quest ofhisfollowers, asked itofGod,
aredtable immediately descended, in
their sight, between twoclouds, andwas
setbefore them, whereupon heroseup,
andhaving made theablution, prayed,
and then took offthecloth which
covered thetable, saying, Inthename
ofGod,thebestprovider offood. What
theprovisions were with which this
tablewasfurnished isamatter wherein
theexpositors arenotagreed. One
willhave them tobenine cakes of
bread andnine fishes;another, bread
and flesh;another, allsorts offood,
except flesh;another, allsorts offood
except bread and flesh;another, all
except bread and fish;another, one
fish,which hadthetaste ofallmanner
offood;andanother, fruits ofparadise,
butthemost received tradition isthat
when thetable wasuncovered, there
appeared afishready dressed, without
scales orprickly fins,dropping with
fat,having saltplaced atitsheadand
vinegar atitstail,andround itallsortsofherbs, except leeks, and fiveloaves
ofbread, ononeofwhich there were
olives, onthesecond honey, onthe
third butter, onthefourth, cheese, and
onthe fifth, dried flesh. They add
thatJesus, attherequest oftheapostles,
showed them another miracle, byre-
storing thefishtolife,andcausing its
scales and finstoreturn toit,atwhich
thestanders-by being affrighted, he
caused ittobecome asbefore;that
1300men andwomen, allafflicted
with bodily infirmities orpoverty, ate
ofthese provisions andwere satisfied,
thefishremaining whole asitwas at
first;thatthen thetable flewupto
heaven inthesight ofall;andevery
onewhohadpartaken ofthisfoodwere
delivered from their infirmities andmis-
fortunes;and that itcontinued to
descend for forty days together at
dinner-time, andstood ontheground
tillthesun declined, andwasthen
taken upintotheclouds. Some ofthe
Mohammedan writers areofopinion
that thistable didnotreally descend,
but that itwasonly aparable;but
most think thewords oftheKoran are
plain tothecontrary. Afurther tradi-
tion is,thatseveral menwere changed
intoswine fordisbelieving thismiracle,
andattributing ittomagic art;or,as
others pretend, forstealing some ofthe
victuals from off it. Several other
fabulous circumstances arealso told
which arescarce worth transcribing.”—Sale’s Kordn Trails, ch. v.p.87,

took place atthehamlet ofAyer Hitam (lit.“Black-

which Iwasabout towitness. Iandmysmall party
arrived inthecourse ofthemorning, andwere received
byBilal Umat, who conducted ustothelong, low

thestrongest possible objection totheuseofeither.
Other “perpetual taboos”(pantang salama-lama-

(mandi telanjang),tothrow thewetbathing-cloth over
theshoulder when returning tothehouse, andtorub
one foot against theother(gosok sahtkaki dengan
lain). Sarongs, umbrellas, andshoes must never on
anypretence beworn. Imayadd that the firstpole
planted iscalled Turns Tuah (tua ?),and ifthe
response ofthespirits totheinvocation befavourable,
itisbelieved that itwillenter theground readily, asif
pulled from below. Theonlyseven-days’ taboo which
Ihave heard mentioned (though, nodoubt, there are

I.PRODUCTION OFFIRE
“Procuring firebyfriction isanaccomplishment
ascommon totheMalay astotheNorth American
Indian. The process is,however, slightly different.
While thelatter resorts tocircular friction, theMalay
cuts anotch ontheconverse surface ofabamboo,
across which herapidly rubs another piece cuttoa
sharp edge.Afinepowder isrubbed away and this
ignites. Bamboo isalsoused asaflintwith tinder.
The all-pervading match, however, isalone used in
alldistricts under foreign influence.”1
The foregoing description requires tobesupple-
mented, forthemethod ofprocuring firebycircular
friction ishardly (ifatall)lesscommon among the
Malays than themethod ofcross friction. The
former process takes theform ofthewell-known
“fire-drill,” both theblock and theupright stick
being generally made ofmahang wood. The
upright stick isfrequently worked byaspecies of
“bow,” such asthatusedbycarpenters, and iskept
fromjumping outofthesocket inwhich itrevolves

from above. When cross friction isused, along
narrow slit isusually cut,following thegrain, inthe
convex surface ofthepiece ofbamboo, thedust
which isrubbed away falling through itandgradually
forming alittle pilewhich presently ignites. Itis
hardly necessary tocutanotch forthecross-piece,
asagroove isvery quickly wornwhen the friction
isstarted. Aspecies offire -syringe has also, I
believe, been collected byMr.L.Wray inPerak.

Inprocuring firebycircular orcross friction the
performer willoften say,bywayofacharm—
“TheMouse-deer asks forFire1
Tosinge hismother-in-law’s feathers.”
The“mouse-deers mother-in-law” isthename ofa
small bird,which issaid tohave verygayplumage of
fivecolours and toresemble thegreen pigeon(punei)
inshape, andtheexplanation ofthischarm issaid
tobethat inthedays ofKing Solomon, when both
themouse-deer and hismother-in-law wore their
human forms, theMouse -deer was greatly annoyed
bytheconduct ofhismother-in-law, whokept dan-
cing infront ofhim ashewent.Aquarrel ensued,2
asthe result ofwhich they were both transformed
into theshapes which theynow respectively bear;
butthemother-in-law hasnotyetabandoned her
exasperating tactics, andmay still often beseen

There are stillsome traces oftheinfluence of
animistic ideas inthat part ofMalay folklore which
isconcerned with fire. Ifaninflammable object,
such aswood, fallsbyaccident into the fire,astick
must beused inextracting it,andthestick left, as
asubstitute, initsplace.
The hearth-fire (apidapor) must never bestepped
over (di-langkah-nya), normust therice-pot which
stands upon it,asinthelatter case theperson who

Both fireandsmoke (fumigation) areagood deal
used bytheMalays forpurposes ofceremonial puri-
fication, butthedetails ofsuch rites cannot becon-
veniently discussed except inconnection with the
complete ceremonies ofwhich theyform apart;they
