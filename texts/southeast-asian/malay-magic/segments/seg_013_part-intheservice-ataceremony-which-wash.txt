Theburning ofincense isoneofthevery simplest,
and hence commonest, forms ofburnt sacrifice.
Some magicians saythat itshould beaccompanied by
aninvocation addressed totheSpirit ofIncense, which
should bebesought, asintheexample quoted below, to
“pervade theseven tiersofearthandskyrespectively.”
Itwould appear thattheintention oftheworshipper is
toensure that his“sacrifice ofsweet savour”should
reach thenostrils ofthegods andhelp topropitiate
them, wherever theymay be,bymeans ofaforetaste
ofofferings tofollow. This invocation, however, is
notunfrequently omitted, oratleast slurred overby
theworshipper, inspite ofthecontention ofthemagi-
cianswho use it,that “without itthe spell merely
rises likesmoke which isblown away bythewind.”
The following isoneform oftheinvocation in
question:—
Zabur1Hijau isyourname,OIncense,
Zabur Bajang thename ofyourMother,
Zabur Puteh thename ofyourFumes,
Scales from theperson ofGod’s Apostle2were your Origin.
Mayyoufumigate theSeven Tiers oftheEarth,
Mayyoufumigate theSeven Tiers oftheSky,
And serve asasummons toallSpirits, tothose which have magic
powers, andthose which havebecome Saints ofGod,
The Spirits ofGod’s elect,whodwell intheHalo oftheSun,
Andwhose resort isthe“Ka‘bah ”ofGod,

especially forthePsalms ofDavid;ofincense from theeyegum ofthe

obvious.

Another form ofsacrifice consists inthescattering
ofrice.The sacrificial rice(Oryza saliva) used inthe
ceremonies isalways ofthefollowing kinds :firstly,
parched rice(b'ras bertiJi);secondly, washed rice
{Uras baso/i)
;thirdly, saffron-stained rice {b'ras
kunyit,i.e.ricestained with turmeric);
2and, finally,
aspecial kind ofglutinous rice called pulut {Oryza
glutinosa),which isalsovery generally used forsacri-
ficial banquets.
Ofthese, theparched rice isgenerally used for
strewing thebottom ofthe sacrificial tray {anchak)
when theframework hasbeen covered withbanana
leaves, buttheofferings have notyetbeen deposited
within it.
Thewashed and saffron ricearegenerally used
forscattering either over thepersons tobebenefited

floor.
