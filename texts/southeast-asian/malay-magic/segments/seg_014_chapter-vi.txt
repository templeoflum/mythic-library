Oneoftheforms oflustration bywater, however,
appears rather totake theplace ofasub-rite, forming
anintegral portion ofalarge class ofceremonies,
such asthose relating toBuilding, Fishing, Agriculture,
Marriage, andsoforth. Hence itwillbenecessary to
give ageneral sketch ofitsleading features inthe
present context.
Theceremony oflustration bywater, when ittakes
theform ofthesub-rite referred to,iscalled “Tepong
Tawar,” which properly means “theNeutralising
Rice-flour (Water),” “neutralising” being used almost
inachemical sense, i.e.inthesense of“sterilising”
theactive element ofpoisons, orofdestroying the
active potentialities ofevil spirits.
The rite itself consists intheapplication1ofathin
pastemade bymixing rice-flour with water :this is
taken upinabrush or“bouquet”ofleaves and
applied totheobjects which the“neutralisation”is
intended toprotect orneutralise, whether theybethe

brush, which isconsidered tobeofthehighest
importance, appears tovary, butonly within certain
limits. Italmost invariably, inSelangor, consists of
aselection ofleaves from thefollowing plants, which
aremade upinsmall bouquets offive,seven, ornine
leaves each, andbound round with ribu-ribu (akind
ofsmall creeper), orastring ofshredded treebark
(claim t'rap).
The following isalistoftheleaves generally
used:—
1.Leaves ofthegrass called sambau dara,which
issaid tobethesymbol ofa“settled soul” (‘alamat

thecoreofthebouquet.1
2.Theleaves oftheselaguri,which appears tobe

4.Theleaves ofthegandarusa (.Insticia gandarusa,

The selection ofthisplant issaid tobeduetoits

fragrant flower).1Itisconsidered tobeapowerful

andoccasionally atthefour corners ofthehouse, to
driveaway ghosts anddemons.

Leaves oftheforegoing plants andshrubs are
made up,ashasbeen said, insmall setsorcombina-
tions offive, seven, oreven perhaps ofnine leaves
apiece. These combinations are said todiffer
according totheobject towhich therice-water isto

allmagicians should make thesame selections even
forthesame objects—rather would they belikely to
make useofsuch leaves onthe listashappen tobe
most readily available. Still, however, astheonly
example ofsuch differentiation which Ihave yetbeen
able toobtain, Iwillgive thedetails ofthree separate

Ill FASTING ANDPENANCE 81
Short rhyming charms arevery often used as
accompaniments ofthe riteofrice-water, butappear
tobeseldom ifeverrepeated aloud. Thefollowing isa
specimen, andothers willbefound intheAppendix r1—
“Neutralising Rice-paste, true Rice-paste,
And, thirdly, Rice-paste ofKadangsa !
Keepmefrom sickness, keepmefrom death,
Keepmefrom injury andruin.”
Other notlessimportant developments oftheidea
oflustration bywater aretobefound insuch cere-
monies asthebathing ofmother and child after a
birth andthewashing ofthefloor (basoh lantei) upon
similar occasions, thebathing ofthesick, ofbride and
bridegroom atweddings, ofcorpses(meruang),2and
theannual bathing expeditions (mandi Safar), which
aresupposed topurify thepersons ofthebathers and
toprotect them from evil (tolak bala).
Fasting, ortheperformance ofreligious penance,
which isnowbutseldom practised, would appear to
have been only undertaken informer days with a
definite object inview, such astheproduction ofthe
state ofmental exaltation which induces ecstatic visions,
theacquisition ofsupernatural powers(sakti),andso
forth.
The fastalways took place, ofcourse, inasolitary
spot,andnotunfrequently upon thetopofsome high
andsolitary hillsuch asMount Ophir (Gunong Led-
ang),ontheborders ofMalacca territory. Frequently,
however, much lower hills, oreven plains which pos-
sessed some remarkable rockortree,would beselected
forthepurpose.

fasting. The result was that fasts might bealmost
indefinitely prolonged, andthethrice-seven-days’ fast
of’CheUtusupon Jugra Hill,ontheSelangor coast,1
isstilloneofthetraditions ofthatneighbourhood,
whilst inMalay romances and inMalay tradition this
form ofreligious penance isfrequently represented as
continuing foryears.
Finally, Iwould draw attention tothestrong vein
ofSympathetic Magic or“make believe”which runs
through andleavens thewhole system ofMalay super-
stition. The root-idea ofthisform ofmagic hasbeen
said tobetheprinciple that “cause follows from effect.”
“Oneoftheprinciples ofsympathetic magic isthat
any effectmaybeproduced byimitating it.... Ifit
iswished tokillaperson, animage ofhim ismade
andthendestroyed;and itisbelieved thatthrough a
certain physical sympathy between theperson andhis
image, theman feels theinjuries done totheimage as
iftheyweredone tohisownbody, andthatwhen itis
destroyed hemust simultaneously perish.”2
The principle thus described isperhaps themost
important ofallthose which underlie the“Black Art”
oftheMalays.
