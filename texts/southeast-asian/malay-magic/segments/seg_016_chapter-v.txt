1.WINDANDWEATHER CHARMS
Not theleastimportant attribute oftheMalay magi-
cian informer dayswas hispower ofcontrolling the
weather—apower ofwhich Malay magic incantations
stillpreserve remarkable traces.
Thuswhen thewind failsandthe sails ofaboat
areflapping (kalau layer k!lepek-fc lepek), aSelangor
magician would notunfrequently summon thewind in
thefollowing terms:—
“Come hither, Sir,come hither,myLord,
Letdown your locks solongandflowing.”
And ifthewind iscontrary hewould say:—
“Veer round, Wind, aneedle ortwain (ofthecompass),
Aneedle to(letme)fetchKapar A
However heavy themerchandise that Icarry unassisted,
Letmerepair toKlang forthe(morning) meal,
AndLangat forthe(evening) bathe.

langor coast which hewishes tovisit (’Che{Akob).


io8 AIR CHAP.
Come hither, Sir,come hither,myLord,
And letdown your locks solongandflowing.”
Again, ifthewindgrew violent hewould say:—
“Eggs oftheHouse-lizard, Eggs oftheGrass-lizard,
Make atriowithEggs oftheTortoise.
Iplant thispolethus inthemid-stream
(That) Wind andTempest maycome tonaught.
LettheWhite (ones) turn intoChalk,
And theBlack (one) intoCharcoal .1
Sometimes themagician willfasten arice-spoon
(ichemcka)2horizontally tothemast ofthevessel, and
repeat some suchcharm asthefollowing:—
“The bird ‘Anggau-anggau5flies
Toperch onthehouse ofMalim Palita.
Mayyoudieasyou lean,mayyoudiefrom apush,
Mayyoudiebythis‘sending’of1Prince Rice-spoon’s.’”3
Ofrain-making ceremonies inSelangor therenow
remains little buttradition. YetaLangat Malay told
methat ifaMalay woman putsupon herhead an
inverted4earthenware pan {i?langa), andthen, setting
itupon theground, fills itwithwater andwashes the
catin ituntil thelatter ismore than halfdrowned,
heavy rain willcertainly ensue .5

Ontheotherhand therecital ofthefollowing charm

2.BIRDS ANDBIRDCHARMS
Thechief features oftheBird-lore ofthePeninsular
Malays, which, aswillappear inthecourse ofthis
chapter, isstrongly tinged with animism, have been
thusdescribed bySirWilliam Maxwell:—
“Ideas ofvarious characters areassociated by
Malays with birds ofdifferent kinds, andmany of
their favourite similes arefurnished bythefeathered
world. The peacock strutting inthejungle, the
argus pheasant calling onthemountain peak, thehoot
oftheowl,and thecryofthenight-jar, have all
suggested comparisons ofvarious kinds, which are
embodied intheproverbs ofthepeople .4TheMalay
1Themeranti isafinehard-wood
forest tree.
2i.e.“Maywebewell sheltered.”
3Vide p.93,supra.
4Theproverbs referred toaretobe
found inthe collections ofproverbs
sentbyMr.Maxwell toNos. 1,2,
and 3oftheJournal oftheStraits
Branch oftheRoyal Asiatic Society.
Thenumbers areconsecutive.
4.Apaguna-nia merak mengigal di
hutan ?
“What istheuseofthepeacock
strutting inthejungle ?”The idea isthat thebeauty ofthe
bird isthrown awaywhen exhibited in
alonely spotwhere there isnone to
admire it.
72.Seperti ponggok merindu bulan.
“Astheowlsighs longingly tothe
moon.”
Afigure often used byMalays in
describing thelonging ofalover for
his mistress. Itrecalls aline in
Gray’s “Elegy,” “The moping owl
doth tothemoon complain.” [Asto

isakeen observer ofnature, and his illustrations,
drawn fromsuch sources, aregenerally justandoften
poetical.
“The supernatural birdGerda (Garuda, theeagle of
Vishnu), who figures frequently inMalay romances, is
dimly known totheMalay peasant. If,during the
day, thesun issuddenly overcast byclouds and
shadow succeeds tobrilliancy, thePerak Malay will
say“Gerda isspreading outhiswings todry.”1Tales
are told, too,ofother fabulous birds2—thejintayu,
which isnever seen, though itsnote isheard, and
which announces theapproach ofrain;3and the
chandrawasi,which hasnofeet. Thechandrawasi
vide infra.) p.122. Capt. Kelham, vide
infra,supposes theponggok tobe

73.Seperti kuang mekik di-puchuk
gunong.
“Like theargus pheasant calling on
themountain peak.”
Another poetical simile foracomplain-
inglover. Here heiscompared toa
lonely birdsounding itsnote farfrom
allcompanions.
93.Seperti tetegok di-rumah tinggal.
“Like thenight-jar atadeserted

Thetegok ortetegok isabirdcommon
intheMalay Peninsula, whose habits
arenocturnal and solitary. Ithasa
peculiar, liquid, monotonous call.The
phrase isused tosignify thesolitude
andloneliness ofastranger inaMalay
kampong.
Elsewhere (in notes afterwards
published intheSelangor Journal)
(vol. i.No. 23, p.360) SirW.E.
Maxwell says“Theburong tetegok is
notanight bird, but fliesbyday. It
canbedistinguished byitsshort rapid
note,which resembles tegok-tegok-tegok-
tegok .”Apparently SirW.E.Maxwell
identifies thisbirdwiththeMalay night-
jar (Caprimulgus macrurus. Horsf.)
described byCapt. Kelham, inNo. 9,page122oftheJ.R.A.S.yS.B. None
oftheDutch Dictionaries identify it
clearly, though Klinkert (probably
wrongly) identifies itwith thesmall
owlcalled ponggok,which istaken by
Capt. Kelham tobeScops lempiji,

2Another fabulous birdwhich Max-
welldoes notmention istheWalimana
(which Ihavemore than once heard
called Wilmana inSelangor). Onthe
identity ofthisbird,my friend Mr.Wilkin-
son,oftheStraits Civil Service, sendsme
inaletter thefollowing note:—“The

Inorigin theword isundoubtedly

Itmeans theBird ofParadise, butin

totheostrich. IntheMalay Peninsula,

V THESPECTRE HUNTSMAN 113
“Thelegend oftheSpectre Huntsman isthus told
bythePerak Malays:—
“Informer days, atKatapang, inSumatra, there
lived amanwhose wife, during herpregnancy, was
seized withaviolent longing forthemeat ofthepelan-
dok(mouse-deer). But itwasnoordinary pelandok
thatshewanted. Sheinsisted that itshould beadoe,
bigwithmale offspring, andshebade herhusband go
andseek inthejungle forwhat shewanted. The
mantook hisweapons anddogs and started, but his
quest was fruitless, forhehadmisunderstood hiswife’s
injunctions, andwhat hesought wasabuckpelandok,
bigwithmale offspring, anunheard-of prodigy.
convenient togivetheMalay legend in
connection withthebirds withwhich the
Malays associate him.Theexplanation
towhich Irefer istobefound inProf.
Newton’s Dictionary ofBirds (1893),
subvoce “Gabble-ratchet.” Iquote
inextenso :—
“Inmany parts ofEngland, but
especially inYorkshire, the cries of
some kind ofwild goose,1when flying
bynight, areheard with dismay by
thosewhodonotknow thecause of
them, andareattributed to‘Gabriel’s
Hounds,’ anexpression equivalent to
‘Gabble -ratchet,’ aterm often used
forthem, asinthissense gabble issaid
tobeacorruption ofGabriel,and that,
according tosome mediaeval glossaries,
isconnected withgabbara orgabares,a
word meaning acorpse (cp.Way,
Promptorhim Parvulorum,p.320,
sub voce*Lyche ’);while ratchet is
undoubtedly thesame astheAnglo-
Saxon rceceandMiddle English racche
orrache,adogthathunts byscentand
gives tongue. Hence theexpression
would originally mean‘corpse-
hounds,’ andpossibly hastodowith
legends such asthatoftheWild Hunts-
man. . . .Thesounds are attimes
verymarvellous, nottosayimpressive,
when heard, asthey almost invariablyare,onapitch-dark night, and ithas
more than once happened within the
writer’s knowledge that aflock of
geese, giving utterance tothem, has
continued forsome hours tocircle over
atown orvillage insuch away asto
attract theattention ofthemost un-
observant ofitsinhabitants, andinspire
with terror those among themwho are
prone tosuperstition. (Cp.Atkinson,
Notes and Queries,ser. 4,vii.pp.

203 ;Herrtage, Catholicon Anglicum,
p.147 ;Robinson, Glossary Whitby,

Glossary Sheffield (Engl. Dial. Soc.)
p.83. Mr. Charles Swainson(Prov .
Names,Br.B.,p.98),gives ‘Gabble-
ratchet’asaname ofthenight-jar,
butsatisfactory proof ofthatstatement
seems tobewanting.”2
1Prof.Newton herehasanote :“Presum-
ably thebrant, ontherareoccasions when,
losing itsway, itcomes inland, forthe call-
notes proceeding from aflock ofthis species
curiously resemble thesound ofhounds infull
cry(Thompson, B.Irel. iii.p.59),though
some hearers liken them totheyelping of
puppies. Thediscrepancy may tosome extent
depend ondistance.”
2Possibly thesounds made bythegeese
might beattributed tothenight -jarby
peasants through the latter’s appearing atthe
timetheywere made. Itiscurious that the
Malays aswellshould connect thenight-jar
with theWildHuntsman.

oftheWild Huntsman, whose shouts thetrembling

Totheinformation contained intheforegoing pas-
sage Iwould addthefollowing observations:—
Charms forneutralising thepower oftheSpectre
Huntsman arebynomeans uncommon, andthough
they almost invariably differ inunimportant details,
such asthenames ofhisdogs andweapons, they still
bear strong andunmistakable family likeness. Still
there aresome versions which contain important
divergencies (two orthree ofthese versions willbe
found intheAppendix), and itwillonlybeafter the
diligent collation and compilation ofagreatmany
versions thattherealgerm ornucleus ofthemyth as
known totheMalays willbeclearly apparent.
One ofthecharms given intheAppendix evi-
dently alludes toadifferent version ofthestory;the
lineswhich contain theallusion being asfollows:—
“Iknow your origin,Oman ofpenance,
Whose dwelling wasupon the hillofMount Ophir,
[You sprang] from asonoftheProphet Joseph whowaswroth
with hismother,
Because shewould eatthehearts ofthebirds ofParadise.”
Yeteven here, ifweexcept theobvious interpola-
tion ofthereference tothe“son oftheProphet
Joseph,” thetaskofreconciling theconflicting versions
maybeeasier thanwould appear atfirstsight .2
Astillmore curious deviation occurs inanother
version,3where theSpectre Huntsman’s poniard and
k'ris aredeclared tobetheinsignia ofthegreat
Spirit- KingRama. Thepassage isasfollows:—

Carries (hisweapons) slung over hisshoulder withback bent

That itishisweapons which theSpectre Hunts-

apassage below, which runs:—
“OSiAdunada, with thesword slung atyour back,

This reference toRama opens upalong vista of

remark thattheSpectre Huntsman himself isalmost

Toreturn from theforegoing digression :there are
many other curious legends connected with Birds.
Thus, in1882, Captain Kelham wrote asfollows:—

oftheGovernment (foremen ofworks)

V LEGENDS ABOUT BIRDS 121
“From Mr.W.E.Maxwell, H.M. Assistant Resi-
dent, ofLarut, Ihear thattheMalays have astrange
legend connected withoneofthelarge Hornbills; but
which species Iwasnotable tofind out. Itisasfol-
lows:—
“‘AMalay, inorder toberevenged onhismother-
in-law (why, thelegend does not relate), shouldered
hisaxeandmade hisway tothepoorwoman’s house,
andbegan tocutthrough theposts which supported it.
After afewsteady chops thewhole edifice came
tumbling down, andhegreeted itsfallwith apealof
laughter. Topunish him forhisunnatural conduct he
wasturned intoabird,andthetebang mentuah (liter-
ally,Hewhochopped down hismother-in-law) may
often beheard inthejungle uttering aseries ofsharp
sounds likethechop ofanaxeontimber, followed by
Ha! ha!ha!’” 1
Thefollowing account ofthebird-lore oftheMalay
Peninsula wascompiled bymefrom notes supplied
totheSelangor Journal2bythe late SirWilliam
Maxwell:—
TheNight-jar (Burong cheroh?) takes itsname from
theword applied tothesecond stage intheoperation
ofhusking rice. Malay women husk ricebypounding
itinamortar with awooden pestle. Thehusked
grain isthencommonly winnowed inasieve, and

Captain H.R.Kelham, whoadds :—
“Iasked Mr.Low,H.B.M. Resi-
dent ofPerak, ifhecould givemeany
information astowhich species of
Hornbill thislegend relates to,andhe
writes—
“‘Itisthelargest Hornbill which is
found inPerak, bigger, Ishould say,
than theRhinoceros Hornbill, but I

theunhusked rice

separated from thehusked riceandpounded over
again. Thesecond process, which iscalled cheroh,
isthatfrom which thenight -jarderives itsname,
thequick fancy oftheMalay hearing inthenote
ofthebird theslowmeasured stroke ofapestle
{antan)descending inamortar(lesong ).This is
possibly thefoundation ofthelegend that theNight-
jar isawoman who, while engaged inhusking rice
bymoonlight, wasturned intoabird inconsequence
ofaquarrel with hermother. Another name for
thenight-jar isburong chempak.
TheBurong sepahputri (“Princess’s betel-quid”)
belongs totheHoney-birds orBee-eaters, ofwhich
there areseveral species, remarkable chiefly fortheir
brilliant metallic plumage. [Aquaint story istold in
explanation ofitsname :onceupon atime theOwl

(Putri Bulan) andasked her tomarry him. She
promised todoso,ifhewould allow her first tofinish
herquid ofbetel undisturbed;butbefore finishing it
shethrew itdown totheearth, where ittook theform
ofthesmall bird inquestion. The Princess then
requested theOwl tomake search for it,but as,of
course, hewasunable tofind it,theproposed match
fellthrough. This isthereason why theOwl, to
quote theMalay proverb, “sighs longingly tothe
Moon,” and isthetype oftheplaintive lover.1

’Tokkatampi (“Old-man-winnow- the-rice-for-the-

)is
aspecies ofhorned owl,which derives itsname from a
word meaning towinnow(tampi,menampi). Malays
saythat this birdhasahabit oftreading upon the
extremities ofitsownwings, and fluttering theupper
part while thus holding them down. This singular
habit produces asound resembling thatofwinnowing.
The’Tohkatampi islarger than theJampuk ,
another species ofowl,which ispopularly supposed
toenter thefowl-house andthere liveontheintestines
offowls, which itextracts during lifebymeans ofa
certain charm i^elmu pelali, acharm similar tothose
used bytheMalays for filing teeth, etc.)which it
uses inorder toperform theoperation painlessly.
The “Luck-bird ”(.Burong untong) isavery small
white birdabout the sizeofacanary. Itbuilds a
very small white nest, which iffound andplaced in
arice-bin possesses thevaluable property ofsecuring

TheMerbu (?merbok)isavariety ofDove which

known where allthehouses inavillage have been

TotheGround-pigeon(Tekukur)belongs the fol-
lowing story:—“Once upon atime there was a
maiden who lived intheforest with herparents and
little sister. When shegrew upshewas troubled
byananxiety toaccompany her father inhisex-
peditions tothe forest, where hewasengaged in
clearing theground forarice -plantation. Her
parents, however, persuaded her tostay athome;
first until thetrees were felled, then until thefallen
timber hadbeen burnt off,then tillthericehadbeen
planted, and then again till itwas cut. When,
however, they attempted toputher offyetonce
more, until the rice should betrodden out, she
could bear itnolonger, andtaking offherbracelets
and earrings, which she leftbehind thedoor, and
placing her little sister intheswinging -cot,she
changed herself intoaground-dove andflewaway to
theclearing. [She retained hernecklace, however,
and thisaccounts forthespeckled marks onthis
doves neck.] Onarriving atthespotwhere her
parents were engaged atwork, shealighted ona
dead treestump(changgong),and called outthrice to
hermother,‘Mother, mother, Ihave leftmyearrings
and bracelets behind thedoor, andhave putmy little
sister intheswing.’ Her mother, amazed atthese
words, hastened home, andfound herdaughter gone.
Shethen returned tothe bird, which repeated the
same words asbefore, this time, however, concluding
with thecooofadove. Invain thedistressed
parents endeavoured torecapture her,bycutting
down the treeonwhich shehadperched;before

they haddone soshe flew toanother, and after
following herfrom tree totree forseveral miles
they were obliged todesist, and shewas never
recaptured.”1
The following notes onbirds aretaken from a
reprint2of“Museum Notes” byMr.L.Wray, jun.,
theofficial curator ofthePerak Museum. Mr.Wray
says:—
“TheWeaver-bird, which makes thelonghanging
bottle -shaped nests occasionally seen hanging from
thebranches ofalow tree, issaid touseagolden
needle inthework;and itisaffirmed that ifthe
nest iscarefully picked topieces, without breaking
anypart of it,theneedle willbefound;but ifitis
pulled ruthlessly apart, orifeven asingle piece of
thegrass ofwhich itismade isbroken inunravelling
it,thegolden needle willdisappear. Themakers of
these curious and beautiful nests aresaid toalways
choose trees that areinfested with redantsorwasps,
orwhich grow inimpassable swamps.”
TheWeaver-bird (Ploceus Bay a,Blyth) iscalled
(inSelangor) Burong Tempua orChiak Raya. Itis
said touseonly thelong jungle grass called lalang
formaking itsnest,which latter iscalled buahrabun,
and isused bytheMalays forpolishing sheaths
and scabbards. When aninfant keeps crying,
one oftheparents takes theweaver- bird’s nest,
reduces ittoashes, andfumigates thechild bythrice
moving itround inacircle over thesmoke. Whilst
doing so,theparent either stands upwith theright

‘Astheweaver-bird’s young initsnest, sorestand

(Bagimana anaktempua dalam sarang-nya,
bagitu-lah ’kaudiam jangan menangis). Tothe
above Imayadd that besides theordinary bottle-
shaped nest, theweaver-birds also occasionally make
ahood-shaped, orrather ahelmet-shaped nest,which
isalleged bytheMalays tobethemale bird’s
‘swing’(buayan ).This ‘swing’ resembles theupper
halfofanordinary bottle-shaped nest, with aperch
across it,which latter isalsowoven ofgrass. On
thewalls oftheswing, justover each end ofthe
perch, isasmall daub ofclay. TheMalays allege
that themale birdswings in itwhile thehen bird
issitting, and that theyoung too‘take the air’ in
itassoon asthey areable toflysofar. Into the
twodaubs ofmudover theperch themale bird (say
theMalays) sticks fire-flies togive itself light at

“The Burong demam,or‘Fever bird,’ issocalled
from itsloud, tremulous note, andtheMalays say
thatthefemale bird calls initsfever-stricken voice to
itsmate togoand find food, because ithasfever so
badly that itcannot go itself. This bird isprobably
oneofthelarge green barbets. The note isoften
heard, anddoubtless thebirdhasbeen collected, but it
isonething shooting abirdandanother identifying it

“Another bird, theWhite-breasted Water-hen, a

Fowling Ceremonies
Ideas ofsympathetic magic runvery strongly
through allceremonies connected with thetaking of
wild birds, such forinstance asjungle-fowl orpigeon.
Thecommonest method ofsnaring jungle-fowl is
totake aline(called rachik),with agreatnumber of
finenooses attached to it,and set itsoastoform a
complete circle, enclosing anopen space intheforest.
Youmust bring adecoy-bird with you,andthe in-
structions which Icollected saythatyoushould on
arriving enter thecircle, holding thebird likeafight-
ingcockyandrepeat these lines:—
“Ho, SiLanang, SiTempawi,
Come and letusplay atcock-fighting
Ontheborder-line between theprimary andsecondary
forest-growth.
Your cock, Grandsire, isspurred with steely
Mine isbutspurred withbamboo.”
Here deposit thebirdupon theground. The chal-
lenge ofthedecoy-bird willthen attract thejungle-
fowlfrom alldirections, and asthey trytoenter the
circle (inorder toreach thedecoy), they willentangle
themselves inthenooses.
Asoften asyousucceed, however, incatching one,
youmustbecareful tocastthe“mischief” outofit,
using thesame form ofwords asisused todrive the
“mischief” outofthecarcase ofthedeer.
Themethod ofcatching wildpigeon ismuch more
elaborate, andbrings theanimistic ideas oftheMalays
intostrong relief, the“souls”ofthewildpigeon being
repeatedly referred to.

“Wak-wak [stands for]aheron onthekitchen shelf,

Now thatyouunderstand theprocess ofdecoying
pigeon with apigeon-call, Imust explain something of
thecurious nomenclature usedbythewizard;fordur-
ingtheceremony youmust never callaspade aspade.
Inthe first place, thehutmust notonanyaccount be
mentioned assuch :itistobecalled theMagic Prince—whysocalled, itishard tosay,butmost likely the
name isused inallusion tothewizard who isconcealed
inside it.Thename given tothecalling-tube itself is
more appropriate, asitiscalled “Prince Distraction”
(Raja Gila), thisname ofcourse being anallusion
totheextraordinary fascination which itevidently
exercises onthepigeon. Then thedecoy (orrather,
perhaps, therod towhich itislinked) iscalled
Piitri Pemonggo’, ortheSquatting Princess. Next
tothese come three Princesses which prove to
bemerely the representatives ofthree important
species ofwild pigeon. Their names, though
variously given, areperhaps mostcommonly known
asPrincess “Kapor,” Princess “Sarap,” andPrincess
“Puding.”
Finally, even therodused forensnaring thepigeon
has itsown special name, SiRaja Nyila (Prince In-
vitation).
“King Solomon’s necklaces” andarmlets areof
course thenooses withwhich they aretobesnared,
andwhich willcatch them either bytheneck orby
theleg.
The Princesses areinvited toenter agorgeous
palace:—


40 BIRDSANDBIRDCHARMS CHAP.
“Come down, pigeons, inyour myriads,
Andperch upon theiIvory Hall,’
(That is)carpeted with silver, andrailed withamalgam,
(Come down) tothedishes ofHerHighness Princess Lebar
Nyiru (Broad-sieve).”1
The “dishes ofHerHighness Princess Broad-
sieve”cleverly suggest anabundance ofprovender
such asislikely toappeal toahungry bird!
Inanother version thethree Princesses are in-
vited toenter the“Palace Tower” called “Fatimah
Passes” (Mahaligei Fatimah Lalu).
Moreover those who issue theinvitation areno
respecters ofpersons:—
“Letthose which arenear, arrive the first,
Letthose which arefaroffbesent for,
Letthose which have eggs, leave their eggs,
Those which have young, leave their young,
Those which areblind, beledbyothers,
Those which havebroken limbs, come oncrutches;
Come andassemble inKing Solomon’s Audience-Chamber.”2
Andasimilar passage inanother charm says—
“Letthose which arenear, arrive the first,
Letthose which arefaroffbesent for,
Cluck !cluck !souls ofthechildren offorest doves,
Come yedown andassemble together

Ifblandishments fail,however, there istobeno
doubt about thepunishments instore fortheir wilful
Highnesses :thus, alittle later,wefindthealternative,
athoroughgoing imprecation calculated to“convince”
themost headstrong ofbirds:—

Andanimprecation ofsimilar import says—

I.BUILDING CEREMONIES ANDCHARMS
The firstoperation inbuilding istheselection of
the site. This isdetermined byanelaborate code of
rules which make thechoice depend—firstly, upon
thenature ofthesoilwith respect tocolour, taste, and
smell;secondly, upon theformation ofitssurface
;and,
thirdly, upon itsaspect:—
“Thebest soil,whether forahouse, village, orchard,
ortown, isagreenish yellow, fragrant-scented, tart-
tasting loam :suchasoilwillensure abundance ofgold
and silver unto thethird generation .1
“The best site, whether forahouse, village,
orchard, ortown, islevel .2
“The best aspect (ofthesurface) isthatofland
which islowupon thenorth sideandhighupon the
south side :such asite willbring absolute peace-
fulness.”3

142 EARTH CHAP.
When youhave found asitecomplying withmore
orlessfavourable conditions, inaccordance with the
code, youmust next clear theground offorest or
undergrowth, laydown four sticks toform arect-
angle inthecentre thereof, and callupon thename
ofthelords ofthatspot (i.e.thepresiding local deities
orspirits). Now digupthesoil(enclosed bythefour
sticks), andtaking aclod inyour hand, callupon the
lords ofthatspot asfollows:—
“Ho,children ofMentri1Guru,
Who dwell intheFour Corners oftheWorld,
Icrave thisplotasaboon.”
(Here mention thepurpose towhich youwish toput it.)
“Ifitisgood, showmeagoodomen,
Ifitisbad,showmeabadomen.”2
Wrap theclodupinwhite cloth, and after fumi-
gating itwith incense, place itatnight beneath your
pillow, andwhen you retire torestrepeat the lasttwo
lines oftheabove charm asbefore andgotosleep.
Ifyourdream isgood proceed with, ifbad desist
from, your operations. Supposing yourdream tobe
“good,” youmust (approximately) clear the siteof
themain building andpegoutthefourcorners with
dead sticks;then take adead branch andheap it
uplightly with earth (inthecentre ofthe site ?) ;set
firetoit,andwhen thewhole heap hasbeen reduced
toashes, sweep italluptogether andcover itover
while yourepeat thecharm (which differs but little
from thatgiven above). Next morning uncover it
early inthemorning andGod willshowyouthegood
andthebad.
1Perhaps acorruption of‘‘Bentara,’’
orBatara, Guru (i.e. Shiva), which is
whatweshould here expect (vide thecharms afew pages farther on).
“Mentri” usually means “minister.”

V ERECTING THECENTRE-POST 43
The sitebeing finally selected, youmust proceed
tochoose adayforerecting thecentral house-post, by
consulting first theschedule oflucky andunlucky
months, andnext theschedule oflucky andunlucky
days oftheweek .1
[The besttimeofdayfortheoperation totakeplace
issaid tobealways seven o’clock inthemorning.
Hence thereseems tobenoneed toconsult aschedule
todiscover it,though some magicians maydoso.]
The propitious moment having been atlastascer-
tained, theerection ofthecentre-post willbeproceeded
with. First, thehole for itsreception must bedug
(theoperation being accompanied bythe recital ofa
charm) andthepost erected, thegreatest precautions
being taken toprevent theshadow ofanyofthe
workers from falling either upon thepost itself orupon
theholedug toreceive it,sickness andtrouble being
otherwise sure tofollow .2
[The account intheAppendix, ofwhich theabove
isardsumd, omits todescribe thesacrifice which has
tobemade before theerection ofthecentre-post, which
hastherefore beendrawn from theinstructions ofother
magicians.]
“When theholehasbeendugandbefore thecentre-
post isactually erected, some sortofsacrifice oroffer-
inghastobemade. Firstyoutakealittle brazilwood

post torestupon(buat lapik tiang srt). Putaring
onyour little finger outofcompliment totheearth-
spirit(akan membujok jembalang itu),repeat the
charm1anderect thepost.”2
Another form oftheabove ceremony wasdescribed
tomebyamagician asfollows:—
“Deposit intheholealittle scrap-iron and tin-ore,
acandle nut(buah k'ras orbuah goi'ek)}abroken
hatchet head (Uliong patcih),andacent (incopper).
Wait tilleverybody else hasreturned home, and,
standing close tothehole, pickupthree clods(kepal)
ofearth, holdthem(,genggam)over theincense, turn
‘right-about-face’andrepeat thecharm .3Then take
thethree clodshome (without once turning round to
lookbehind you tillyoureach home), placethem under
your sleeping pillow andwait tillnightfall, when you
mayhave either agood orabaddream. Ifthe first
night’s dream bebad,throw away oneoftheclods
anddream again. Ifthesecond night’s dream be

2Analternative method was thus
described tomebyamagician :Take
awhite cup, fill itwith water, fumigate
itwith incense, and deposit itinthe
hole dug toreceive thecentre-post.
Early nextmorning take note ofit;if
itisstill fullofwater, itisagood sign;
ifthewater haswasted (susut), abad
one. Iflive insects arefound in it,
itisagood sign, ifdead ones, bad.
There can,however, be little doubt
thattheoriginal victim ofthis sacrifice
wasahuman victim (generally perhaps
aslave), forwhom the buffalo wassubstituted (the goat, fowl, andegg
representing further successive stages
inthedepreciation oftherite). Malays
ontheSelangor coast more thanonce
toldmetheyhadheard thattheGovern-
ment was inthehabit ofburying a
human head under thefoundations of
anyunusually large structure (e.g. a
bridge), andtwo cases where alocal
scare resulted from theprevalence of
this ideawere recorded inthelocal
press (theMalay Mail) in1897.

bad,repeat theprocess, andwhenever yougetagood
dream deposit theclod orclods under thebutt-end
ofthecentre-post toserve asafoundation.”
Amagician gavemethisspecimen ofacharm
used atthisceremony (oferecting thecentre-post):—
“Ho,Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru,
You arethesons ofBatara Guru.
Iknow theorigin fromwhich youspring,
From theFlashing ofLightning’s spurs;
Iknow theorigin fromwhich you spring,
From theBrightening ofDaybreak.
Ho,Spectre oftheEarth, Brains oftheEarth, Demon ofthe
Earth,
Retire yehence tothedepths oftheOcean,
Tothepeace oftheprimeval forest.
Betwixt youandme
Division wasmade byAdam.”
Another rule ofimportance inhouse-building is
thatwhich regulates thelength ofthethreshold, as
towhich theinstructions areasfollows:—
“Measure off(onapiece ofstring) thestretch
(fathom) ofthearms ofherwho istobemistress of
theproposed house. Fold this string inthree and
cutoffone third. Take theremainder, fold itineight
andcutoffseven-eighths. Take theremaining eighth,
seehowmany times itiscontained inthelength of
thethreshold, andcheck offthenumber (ofthese
measurements) against the“category” (bilangan) of
the“eight beasts”1(benatang yang (Tlapan). This
category runs asfollows:—(1)Thedragon(naga);(2)
thedairy-cow (sapi)
;(3)thelion(singa)
;(4)thedog
(anjing)
;(5)thedraught-cow (lembu);(6)theass

tions. Ifthe lastmeasurement coincides withoneof
theunlucky beasts inthecategory, such asthecrow
(which signifies thedeath ofthemaster ofthehouse),
thethreshold iscutshorter tomake itfitinwithone
that ismore auspicious.”1
Thenames ofthe“eight beasts,” coupled with the
events which they aresupposed toforeshadow, are
oftencommemorated inrhyming stanzas.
Here isaspecimen:—
I.—TheDragon (naga).
“Adragon ofbulk, amonster dragon,
Isthisdragon thatturns round month bymonth .2
Wherever yougoyou willbesafefrom stumbling-blocks,
And allwhomeetyou willbeyour friends.”
II.—TheDairy-Cow (sapi).
“There isthesmoke ofafireintheforest,
Where Inche ‘Ali isburning lime;
They were milking theyoung dairy-cow,
And inthemidst ofthemilking itsprawled and felldown

III.—TheLion (singa).
“Alionofcourage, alionofvalour,
Istheliongambolling attheendofthePoint.
Theluck ofthishouse willbelasting,
Bringing youprosperity from year toyear.”
IV.—TheDog (anjing).
“Thewild dog, thejackal,
Barks atthedeerfrom night tonight;
Whatever youdowillbeastumbling-block;
Inthishousemen willstaboneanother.”
1Another form ofmeasurement was
from thethreshold (ofthefront door)
totheendofthehouse;but the
method ofaugury inthis cas'? isnot
yetquite clear.2Thisprobably refers tothemystic
Dragon which does duty (inMalay
charm-books) asan“aspect compass.”
Vide Chap. VI. p.561, infra,and
App. cclvii.

“The bigcowfrom themiddle oftheclearing

Great good luck willbeyour portion,
Never willyoucease tobeprosperous.”
VI.—TheAss (kaldei).
“The asswithin theFort

VII.—TheElephant (gajah).
“The bigriding elephant oftheSultan

VIII.—TheCrow (gagak).
“Ablack crow soaring bynight

Great indeed isthecalamity which hashappened:
Within thehouse itsmaster liesdead.”
Inclose connection with theceremonies forthe
selection ofindividual house sites aretheforms by
which theprinces ofMalay tradition selected sites
forthetowns which they founded. The following
extract will perhaps convey some idea oftheir
character :—
“OnedayRajaMarong Maha Podisat went into
hisouter audience hall, where allhis ministers,
warriors, and officers were inattendance, andcom-
manded thefourMantris toequip anexpedition
with allthenecessary officers andarmed men, and
with horses andelephants, arms andaccoutrements.
The fourMantris didastheywere ordered, andwhen


148 BUILDING CEREMONIES CHAP.
allwasready they informed theRaja. The latter
waited foralucky dayandanauspicious moment,
andthen desired hissecond son tosetout.The
Prince took leave after saluting hisfather andmother,
and alltheministers, officers, andwarriors who fol-
lowed him performed obeisance before the Raja.
They then setout insearch ofaplace ofsettlement,
directing their course between south and east, intend-
ingtoselect aplace withgood soil,andthere tobuild
atown with fort, moat, palace, and balei} They
amused themselves inevery forest, wood, andthicket
through which they passed, crossing numbers ofhills
andmountains, andstopping hereandthere tohunt
wild beasts, ortofish iftheyhappened tofallinwith
apool orlake.
“After theyhadpursued their quest forsome
time theycame tothetributary ofalarge river
which flowed down tothe sea. Farther onthey
came toalarge sheet ofwater, inthemidst ofwhich
were four islands. The Prince wasmuch pleased
with theappearance oftheislands, andstraightway
took asilver arrow and fitted ittohisbownamed
Indra Sakti, and said :‘Oarrow ofthebowIndra
Sakti, fallthouongood soil inthisgroup ofislands;
wherever thou mayest chance to fall, there will I
make apalace inwhich tolive.’Hethendrew his

sight again, and fellupon oneofthe islands, which
onthataccount was called Pulau Indra Sakti. On
that spotwaserected atown with fort, palace, and

baleiyand allthepeople whowere living scattered
about inthevicinity were collected together and set
towork onthevarious buildings.”1
Even inthemaking ofroads through the
forest itwould appear that sacrificial ceremonies
arenot invariably neglected. Ononeoccasion I
came upon aparty ofMalays intheLabu jungle
whowere engaged inmaking abridle-track forthe
Selangor Government. Asmall bamboo censer, on
which incense hadbeen burning, hadbeen erected
inthemiddle ofthetrace;and Iwasinformed that
thenecessary rites (forexorcising thedemons from

2.BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS
Allwild animals, more especially thelarger and
more dangerous species, arecredited inMalay folk-
lorewithhuman or(occasionally) superhuman powers.
Inthepages which nowfollow Ishall dealwith the
folklore which refers tothemore important animals,
firstpointing outtheir anthropomorphic traits, then
detailing some ofthemore important traditions
about them, and finally, where possible, describing the
methods ofhunting them.

them which have been inherited from theprimitive
tribes ofEastern Asia. Muhammadanism hasnot
been able tostamp outthedeep-rooted feelings which
prompted thesavage toinvest thewild beasts which
hedreaded with thecharacter ofmalignant deities.
The tiger, elephant, andrhinoceros1were notmere
brutes tobeattacked anddestroyed. Theimmense
advantages which their strength andbulkgavethem
over thefeebly-armed savage ofthemost primitive
tribes naturally suggested thepossession ofsuper-
natural powers;and propitiation, not force, wasthe
system bywhich itwashoped torepel them. The
Malay addresses thetiger asDatok (grandfather), and
believes thatmany tigers areinhabited byhuman
souls. Though hereduces theelephant tosubjection,
anduseshim asabeast ofburden, itisuniversally
believed thattheobservance ofparticular ceremonies,
andtherepetition ofprescribed formulas, arenecessary
before wild elephants canbeentrapped andtamed.
Some ofthese spells andcharms(mantra)aresupposed
tohave extraordinary potency, and Ihave inmy
possession acurious collection ofthem, regarding
which, itwas toldmeseriously byaMalay, that in
consequence oftheir being read aloud inhishouse

This idea isinherited, bothbyMalays andSiamese,

Totheabove evidence (which was collected by
SirW.E.Maxwell nodoubt mainly inPerak) Iwould
addthat atLabu, inSelangor, Iheard onmore than
oneoccasion astory inwhich theelephant-folk were
described aspossessing, ontheborders ofSiam, acity
oftheir own, where they live inhouses likehuman
beings, andwear their natural human shape. This
story, which was first toldmebyUngku Said Kechil
ofJelebu, wastakendown bymeatthetime, andran
asfollows:—
“AMalay named Laboh went outonedaytohis
rice-field andfound thatelephants hadbeen destroying
hisrice.
“Hetherefore planted caltrops ofacubit and a
half inlength inthetracks oftheoffenders. That
night anelephant waswounded inthefootbyoneof
thecaltrops, andwent offbellowing with pain.

days and nights journeying, found himself onthe

encountered anoldman, towhom heremarked‘Hullo,

The oldman replied, ‘Yes, for allnoise isforbidden,
because theking’s daughter is ill.’‘What isthe

replied thatshehadtrodden upon acaltrop. SiLaboh
then asked,‘May Isee if Icandoanything tohelp

“The oldman thenwentandreported thematter
totheking,whoordered SiLaboh tobebrought into

“[Now thecountry which SiLaboh hadreached
wasafineopen country ontheborders ofSiam. It
iscalled‘PakHenang,’ and itsonly inhabitants are

Andwhoever trespasses over theboundaries ofthat

“Then SiLaboh saw that theking’s daughter,
whose name wasPrincess Rimbut, was suffering from
oneofthecaltrops which hehimself had planted.
Hetherefore extracted itfrom her foot, sothatshe
recovered, andtheking, inorder toreward SiLaboh,
gavehimthePrincess inmarriage.
“Nowwhen theyhadbeen married along time,
