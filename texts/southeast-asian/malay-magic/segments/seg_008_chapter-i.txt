CHAPTER I
Nature
(a)Creation oftheWorld
The theory oftheCreation most usually held by
Peninsular Malays issummarised inthefollowing
passage, quoted (in1839) byLieutenant Newbold
from aMalay folk-tale:—
“From theSupreme Being firstemanated light
towards chaos;this light, diffusing itself, became the
vast ocean. From thebosom ofthewaters thick
vapour andfoam ascended. The earth andseawere
thenformed, each ofseven tiers. Theearth rested on
thesurface ofthewater from east towest. God, in
order torender steadfast thefoundations oftheworld,
which vibrated tremulously with themotion ofthe
watery expanse, girt itround with anadamantine
chain, viz.thestupendous mountains ofCaucasus, the
wondrous regions ofgenii and aerial spirits. Beyond
these limits isspread outavast plain, thesandand
earth ofwhich areofgold andmusk, thestones
rubies and emeralds, thevegetation ofodoriferous
flowers.
“From therange ofCaucasus allthemountains of

theearth have their origin aspillars tosupport and
strengthen theterrestrial framework.”1
TheMountains ofCaucasus areusually called by
Malays BukitKof(i.e .Kaf), ortheMountains ofKaf
(which latter istheirArabic name). These mountains are
notunfrequently referred toinMalay charms, e.g.inin-
vocations addressed totheRice-Spirit. TheMountains
ofKafaretotheMalays agreat range which serves
asa“wall”(dividing') totheearth, andkeeps offboth
excessive winds andbeasts ofprey. This wall,how-
ever, isbeing bored through bypeople called Yajuj
andMajuj (Gog andMagog), andwhen theysucceed
intheir tasktheendofallthings willcome. Besides
these mountains which surround theearth there isa
great central mountain called Mahameru (Saguntang
Maha Biru, ormerely Saguntang-guntang).2In
many Malay stories this hillMahameru isidentified
withSaguntang-guntang ontheborders ofPalembang
inSumatra.
The account which Ishallnow give, however,
differs considerably from thepreceding. Itwastaken
down bymefrom anintroduction toaMalay charm-
book belonging toamagician (one‘Abdul Razzak of
Klang inSelangor), withwhom Iwasacquainted, but
who,though heallowed metocopy it,would notallow
meeither tobuyorborrow thebook :3—

Now from before thebeginning oftime existed that
Magician—that is,God—andHemade Himself mani-
festwith thebrightness ofthemoon and thesun,
which isthetoken oftheTrue Magician.”
The account proceeds todescribe howGod
'‘created thepillar oftheKa'bah,1which istheNavel

. . .whose branches arefour innumber, and are
called, the first,‘Sajeratul Mentahar,’ andthesecond

west,where they arecalled theFour Corners ofthe
World.”
Nextweread thattheword ofGodAlmighty came
insecret toGabriel, saying, “Takemedown theiron

The most curious feature ofthedescription is
perhaps themarked anthropomorphic character of
thisserpent, which shows ittobeaserpent inlittle
more thanname. Itseems, infact,veryprobable that
wehave here areminiscence oftheIndian “Naga.”1
Thuswefindtherainbow (here divided into itscom-
ponent parts) described asoriginating from theserpent’s
sword with itshiltandcross-piece (guard), grass from
thehair ofitsbody, trees from thehairofitshead,
rainfrom itstears, anddewfrom itssweat.
Another account, alsoobtained from alocal magi-
cian, contains oneortwo additional details about the
tree. “Kun” saidGod, “Payah'1kun” saidMuham-
mad,andaseedwascreated.
“The seedbecame aroot (lit.sinew), theroot a
tree,andthetreebrought forth leaves.
“ lKunl saidGod,‘Payahkun,’saidMuhammad;
. ..Then wereHeaven andEarth (created), ‘Earth
ofthewidth ofatray,Heaven ofthewidth ofan
umbrella.’”
This isacurious passage, andonenotover-easy to

sented inoldsculptures asbearing the
human form, butwith asnake attached
totheir backs, and thehooded head
rising behind their necks.—Naga-

maybetheexplanation oftheMalay
k'ris hilt, ordagger hilt,which repre-
sents aseated human form with folded
arms andahood attheback ofits
neck rising over itshead. These
hilts are called hulu Malayu (the
“Malay hilt”), orJawa demam (lit.
the“Fever-stricken Javanese”), inallu-
sion totheattitude ofthefigure withitsfolded arms. Thepattern ofthese
hilts,which areuniversally used forthe
national Malay k’ris ordagger, varies
from anaccurate representation ofthe
human figure toforms inwhich nothing
butthehood(which isoccasionally much
exaggerated) isrecognisable. Euro-
peans seeing these hilts forthe first
timesometimes takethem forsnakes’
heads, sometimes fortheheads ofbirds.

perhaps with themeaning “so also.”

suggests, however, thatthe“Earth ofthewidth ofa
tray,andHeaven ofthewidth ofanumbrella,” may
beintended torepresent respectively the“souls”
(semangat) ofheaven and earth, inwhich case they
would bear thesame relation tothematerial heaven
andearth astheman-shaped human souldoes tothe
body ofaman.
(b)Natural Phenomena
“Most Malays,” says Newbold, “with whom I
have conversed onthesubject, imagine thattheworld
isofanoval shape, revolving upon itsown axis four
times inthespace ofoneyear;thatthesun isacircular
body offiremoving round theearth, andproducing
thealternations ofnight andday.”
To this Iwould add thatsome Malays, at
least,whom Iquestioned onthesubject (aswell as
some Sakais1under Malay influence), imagined the
firmament toconsist ofasortofstone orrockwhich
they called Batuhampar,or“Bed rock,” theappear-
ance ofstars being caused (astheysupposed) bythe
lightwhich streams through itsperforations.

universe isgirtround byanimmense serpent or
dragon (Ular Naga), which “feeds upon itsown tail.”
TheMalay theory ofthetides isconcisely stated
byNewbold :2—
“Some Malays ascribe thetides totheinfluence
ofthesun;others tosomeunknown current ofthe
ocean;butthegenerality believe confidently the
following, which isamere skeleton ofthe original
legend. Inthemiddle ofthegreat ocean grows an
immense tree, called Pauh Jangi,3attheroot of

Thespelling of“Jangi”isincorrect. It

3This treeappears tobeatradition
oftheCocosMaldiva,ofwhich SirH.
Yule, s.v.Coco-de-Mer, gives the fol-
lowing interesting account :—
“Coco-de-Mer,orDouble Coco-nut,
thecurious twin fruit socalled, the
produce oftheL'odoicea Sechellarumy
apalm growing only intheSeychelles
Islands, iscastupontheshores ofthe
Indian Ocean, most frequently onthe
Maidive Islands, butoccasionally also
onCeylon and S.India, andonthe
coasts ofZanzibar, ofSumatra, and
some others oftheMalay Islands.
Great virtues asmedicine andantidote
weresupposed toreside inthese fruits,
andextravagant prices were paid for
them. The story goes thata‘country
captain,’ expecting tomake hisfortune,
took acargo ofthese nutsfrom the
Seychelles Islands toCalcutta, butthe
only result was todestroy their value
forthefuture.“The oldbelief wasthatthefruitwas
produced onapalm growing below the
sea,whose fronds, according toMalay
seamen, were sometimes seen inquiet
bights ontheSumatran coast, especially
intheLampong Bay. According to
oneform ofthestoryamong theMalays,
which istoldbothbyPigafetta andby
Rumphius, therewasbutonesuch tree,
thefronds ofwhich roseabove an
abyss oftheSouthern Ocean, andwere
theabode ofthemonstrous birdGaruda
(orRukh oftheArabs). The tree
itself was called Pau-sengi,which
Rumphius seems tointerpret asa
corruption ofBuwa-zangi,*Fruit of
Zang,’ orE.Africa. They were cast
upoccasionally ontheislands ofthe
S.W. coast ofSumatra;and the
wild people ofthe islands brought
them forsale totheSumatran marts,
such asPadang andPriamang. One
ofthelargest (sayabout twelve inches
across) would sell for150 rixdollars.
ButtheMalay princes coveted them
greatly, andwould sometimes (itwas
alleged) givealaden junk forasingle
nut. InIndia thebest-known source
ofsupply was from the Maidive
Islands.
“The medical virtues ofthenutwere
notonlyfamous among allthepeople
oftheEast, including theChinese, but
areextolled byPisoandbyRumphius,
withmany details. The latter, learned
andlaborious student ofnature ashe

thelake. This isinhabited byavast crab,whogoes
forth atstated periods during theday.When the
creature returns toitsabode thedisplaced water
causes theflowofthetide;when hedeparts, thewater

Mr. Clifford gives aslightly different expla-
nation:—

tobeahuge hole intheocean bottom. Inthishole
there sitsagigantic crabwhich twice adaygets out
inorder tosearch forfood. While heissitting inthe
hole thewaters oftheocean areunable topourdown

filled andblocked bythecrab’s bulk. The inflowing
oftherivers into theseaduring these periods are
supposed tocause therising ofthe tide, while the
downpouring ofthewaters through thegreat hole
when thecrab isabsent searching forfood issupposed
tocause theebb.”

Hobson-Jobson,loc. cit.
Tothisvaluable note Iwould add
thatRumphius isevidently wrong ifhe
derives thename ofthe tree,“Pau-
sengi,” from theMalay “Buwa-zangi.”
The first part oftheword is“Pau”or“Pauli,” which isperfectly good
Malay, and isthename given to
various species ofmango, especially
thewild one, sothat“Pau-sengi”
actually represents (not“Buwa,”
but)“Pauh Janggi,” which istothis
daytheuniversal Malay name forthe
treewhich grows, according toMalay
fable, inthe central whirlpool or
Navel oftheSeas. Some versions add
that itgrows upon asunken bank
(tebing runtoh),and isguarded by
dragons. This tree figures largely in
Malay romances, especially those which
form thesubject ofMalay shadow-
plays, {vide infra,PI.23,foranillustra-
tionofthePauh Janggi andtheCrab).
Rumphius’ explanation ofthesecond
part ofthename (i.e.Janggi) is,no
doubt, quite correct.

“There wasonce aSelangor mannamed Haji
