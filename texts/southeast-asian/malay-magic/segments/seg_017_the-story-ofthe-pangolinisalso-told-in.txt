which theelephant isafraid toapproach.”1
Thefollowing directions forhunting theelephant
were givenmebyLebai Jamal, afamous elephant
hunter ofLingging, near theSungei Ujong border:—
“When you firstmeet with thespoor ofelephant
orrhinoceros, observe whether thefoot-hole contains
anydeadwood, (then) take thetwig ofdeadwood, to-
gether withaballofearth asbigasamaize-cob taken
from thesame foot-hole (ifthere isonlyoneofyou,
one ball willdo, ifthere arethree ofyou, three balls
willbewanted, ifseven, seven balls, butnotmore).
Then rollupyour ballofearth andthetwig together,
inatree-leaf, breathe upon it,andrecite thecharm (for
blinding theelephant’s eyes), thepurport ofwhich is
that ifthequarry sees, itseyesight shall bedestroyed,
and ifitlooks, itseyesight shall bedimmed, bythe

The perquisites ofthePawang (magician) aretobe
“alittle black clothandalittlewhite cloth,” andthe
only special taboo mentioned byLebai Jamal was“on
noaccount toletthenaked skin rubagainst theskin
oftheslain animal.”
Before leaving thesubject ofelephants, Imayadd
thatRaja Ja‘far (ofBeranang inSelangor) toldme
thatLebai Jamal, when charged byanelephant or
rhinoceros, would drawupon theground with hisfinger
alinewhich theinfuriated animal wasnever able to
cross. This line,hesaid,was called theBaris Lak-
samana, orthe“Admiral’s Line,” andtheknowledge
ofhow todraw itwasnaturally looked upon asagreat
acquisition.
1“The Malays believe that the
power toinform aspirit, awild beast,
oranynatural object, such asiron rust,
ofthesource fromwhich itoriginates
{usul asalkajadi-an-nya), renders it
powerless.” H.Clifford inNo.3of

ofMalays inthePeninsula. Possibly

V THETIGER 157
TheTiger
“The Tiger issometimes believed tobeaman
ordemon intheform ofawild beast, and tothe
numerous aboriginal superstitions which attach tothis
dreaded animal Muhammadanism hasadded thenotion
which connects theTiger with theKhalif Ali.One
ofAli’s titles throughout theMoslem world is ‘the
Victorious Lion oftheLord/ and inAsiatic countries,
where thelion isunknown, thetiger generally takes
theplace ofthe‘king ofbeasts/”1
But theanthropomorphic ideas oftheMalays
about theTiger goyetfarther than this. Faraway in
thejungle (as Ihave several times been told inSelan-
gor)thetiger-folk (no lessthan theelephants) have a
town oftheirown,where they live inhouses, and act
inevery respect likehuman beings. Inthetown re-
ferred totheir house-posts aremade oftheheart of
theTree-nettle {fras jelatang\ andtheir roofs thatched
withhuman hair—oneinformant added that men’s
bones were their only rafters, andmen’s skins their
house walls—andthere they livequietly enough until
oneoftheir periodical attacks offierceness(meng-
ganas)comes onandcauses them tobreak bounds
andrange theforest fortheirchosen prey.
There areseveral ofthese tiger-villages or“en-
closures” inthePeninsula, thechief ofthem being
Gunong Ledang (theMount Ophir ofMalacca), just
asPasummah isthe chief ofsuch localities in
Sumatra.2Sotoo,from Perak, SirW.E.Maxwell
writes in1881:—
1J.R.A.S .,S.B., No. 7,p.22.

“Amischievous tiger issaidsometimes tohave
broken loose from itspenorfold(pechah kandang).
This isinallusion toanextraordinary belief that, in
parts ofthePeninsula, there areregular enclosures
where tigers possessed byhuman souls live inassocia-
tion. During thedaytheyroam where they please,
butreturn tothekandang atnight.”1
Various fables ascribe tothe tiger ahuman
origin. One ofthese, taken down bymeword
forword from aSelangor Malay, isintended to
account forthe tiger’s stripes. The gistofitranas
follows:—
“Anoldmanpicked upaboy inthejungle with a
white skin,green eyes,andverylong nails. Taking
theboyhome hisrescuer named himMuhammad Yatim
(i.e.‘Muhammad thefatherless ’),andwhen hegrewup
senthim toschool, where hebehaved with great
cruelty tohisschoolfellows, andwastherefore soundly

think, indeed, that tigers ingeneral are
actuated with the spirits ofdeparted
men,andnoconsideration will prevail
onacountryman tocatch ortowound
one,butinself-defence, orimmediately
after theactofdestroying afriend or

common titleofthetiger inSelangor.
Various nicknames, however, aregiven,

’PahRandau, ‘4father shaggy-face,”etc.]“When anEuropean procures traps to

Ionceasked (atLabu) how itwasknown thatthe
tigerused divination, andwas told thisstory ofaman
whohadseen it:—
“A certain Malay hadbeen working, together
with hisnewly-married wife, intherice-fields atLabu,
andonhisstepping aside atnoon intothecoolofthe
forest, hesawatiger lyingdownamong theunder-
wood apparently gazing atsomething between itspaws.
Bycreeping stealthily nearer hewasable atlength to
discern theobject atwhich thetigerwasgazing, and it
proved tobe,tohisintense horror, aleafwhich pre-
sented thelineaments ofhiswife, lacking onlythehead.
Hurrying back totherice-field heatoncewarned the
neighbours ofwhat hehadseen, andimplored them to
sethiswife intheir midst and escort herhomeward.
Tothisthey consented, butyet, inspite ofevery pre-
caution, thetigerbroke through themidst ofthemand

bereaved husband thereupon requested them toleave
himalone withthebodyanddepart, andwhen theyhad
done so,hetook thebody inhisarms, andsolaydown
embracing it,with adagger ineither hand. Before
sunset thetiger returned toitskill,andleaptupon the

Thepower ofbecoming aman- orwere-tiger (as it

toonetribe ofSumatrans, theKorinchi Malays, many
ofwhom aretobemetwith intheMalay Native States.


V WERE-TIGERS 161
This belief isvery strongly held,andononeoccasion,
when Iasked some Malays atJugra how itcould be
proved thattheman really became atiger, they told
methecaseofamansome ofwhose teeth were plated
with gold,andwhohadbeen accidentally killed inthe
tiger stage,when thesame gold plating wasdiscovered
inthetiger’s mouth .1

Malay knows that itistrue. Evidence, ifitbeneeded,

with these plain evidences before their eyes, theempty
assurances oftheenlightened European thatWere-
Tigers donot,andnever didexist, excite derision not
unmingled withcontempt.”1
Writing onthesame theme, SirFrank Swettenham
says:—
“Another article ofalmost universal belief isthat
thepeople ofasmall State inSumatra called Korinchi
have thepower ofassuming atwilltheform ofatiger,
and inthat disguise theywreak vengeance onthose
theywish toinjure. Notevery Korinchi mancando
this,but stillthe giftofthisstrange power ofmeta-
morphosis ispretty wellconfined tothepeople ofthe
small Sumatran State. Atnight when respectable
members ofsociety should beinbed, theKorinchi
man slipsdown from hishut,and,assuming theform
ofatiger, goesabout‘seeking whom hemay devour.’
“Ihave heard offourKorinchi men arriving ina
district ofPerak, and that night anumber offowls
were taken byatiger. The strangers leftandwent
farther upcountry, andshortly after onlythree ofthem
returned and stated thatatigerhadjustbeen killed,
andtheybegged thelocalheadman tobury it.

andsought hospitality inaMalay house, andthere also
thefowls disappeared inthenight, andthere were un-
mistakable traces ofthevisitofatiger, butthenext
dayoneofthe visitors fell sick, and shortly after
vomited chicken-feathers.

oftheKorinchi country. Even there, however, itis
only thosewho arepractised intheelemu sehir, the
occult arts,whoarethuscapable oftransforming them-
selves into tigers, andtheKorinchi people profess
themselves afraid toenter theChenaku district.”1
There aremany stories about ghost tigers (rimau
kramat),which aregenerally supposed tohave one
footalittle smaller than theothers {kaki tengkis).
During mystay intheLangat district Iwasshown
onmore thanoneoccasion thespoor ofaghost tiger.
Thishappened once nearSepang village, onawet
andclayey bridle- track, where theunnatural small-
ness ofoneofthefeetwasvery conspicuous. Such
tigers areconsidered invulnerable, butharmless to
man,andarelooked upon generally astheguardian
spirits ofsome sacred spot. One ofthese sacred
spots was theshrine(kramat)of’Toh Kamarong,
about two miles north ofSepang village. This
shrine, itwas alleged, wasguarded byawhite ghost
elephant andghost tiger,whoranged thecountry
round butnever harmed anybody. One day,how-
ever, aChinaman from theneighbouring pepper
plantations offered atthis shrine apiece ofpork,
which, however acceptable itmight have been toa
Chinese saint, soincensed theorthodox guardians of
thisMuhammadan shrine thatoneofthem (theghost
tiger) fellupon theChinaman andslewhim before
hecould return tohishouse.
Byfarthemost celebrated ofthese ghost tigers,
however, were theguardians oftheshrine atthefoot
ofJugra Hill, which were formerly thepets ofthe
Princess ofMalacca (Tuan PutriGunong Ledang).

Local report says that thisprincess lefthercountry
when itwastaken bythePortuguese, andestablished
herself onJugra Hill, asolitary hillonthesouthern
portion oftheSelangor coast, which ismarked on
oldcharts asthe“False Parcelar” hill.
The legend which connects thename ofthis
princess withJugra Hillwasthus told1byMr.G.C.
Bellamy (formerly oftheSelangor Civil Service).
“Bukit Jugra (Jugra Hill) initsisolated position,
andconspicuous as itisfrom thesea,could scarcely
escape being anobject ofveneration totheuneducated
Malay mind. The jungle which clothes itssummit
and sides issupposed tobefullofhantus (demons
orghosts), andoftenwhen talking toMalays inmy
bungalow intheevening have ourdiscussions been
interrupted bythe cries ofthe langswayer (a
female birth-demon) intheneighbouring jungle, or
themutterings ofthebajang (afamiliar spirit) as
hesatontheroof-tree. Butthe‘Putri’ (Princess)
ofGunong Ledang holds thepremier position amongst
thefabulous denizens ofthejungle onthe hill,and it
isstrange that places sofarapart asMount Ophir
and Bukit Jugra should beassociated with one
another intraditionary lore. The story runs that
thisestimable lady, having disposed ofherhusband
bypricking him todeath with needles,2decided
thenceforth tolive free from the restrictions of
married life. Shewas thus able tovisit distant
lands, taking with heracat3offabulous dimensions
asher sole attendant. This catappears tohave
been amost amiable andaccommodating creature,
foronarriving atJugra hecarried thePrincess on

pays periodical visits toJugra Hill,andalthough she
herself isinvisible tomortal eye,herfaithful attendant,
intheshape ofahandsome tiger, isoften tobemet
with asheprowls about theplace atnight. Hehas
never beenknown toinjure anyone,and isreverently
spoken ofasarimau kramat (ghost tiger).”
Totheabove story Mr. C.H.A.Turney (then
Senior District Officer andstationed atJugra) added
thefollowing:—
“The Princess andthestories about herandthe
tiger arewellknown, andthelatter arerelated from
mother todaughter inLangat.
“There are, however, they say,one ortwo
omissions;instead ofone tiger there were two, the
realharimau kramat andanambitious young tiger
whowould also follow thePrincess inherround of
visits. This brute came toanuntimely and igno-
minious end (ashedeserved to)atthehands ofone
Innes, whowasdisturbed whilst reading anewspaper,
and thiscanbeverified byCaptain Syers.
“The other tiger jogged along gaily with his
phantom mistress, andmade night hideous with his
howlings and prowlings allabout theJugra Hill.

shot atbyseveral Malays, andthepresent Sergeant-

details:—
“The local version ofthelegend about thekramat

Onceupon atimeoneNakhoda Ragam wastravelling
with hiswife(who isapparently tobeidentified with
thePrincess ofMalacca, Tuan PiitriGunong Ledang)
inaboat [sampan), when the latter pricked him to
death with aneedle(mati di-chuckok jarum ).His
blood flooded theboat(darah-nya hanyut dalam sam-

Princess replied: ‘It isonly spinach -juice’[kuah

landed atthefoot ofJugra Hill,where sheburied
allthatyetremained ofherhusband, which consisted
ofonlyonethigh(paha )}She alsotook ashore her
two cats,which were intheboatwith her,andwhich,
turning intoghost tigers, became theguardians ofthis
nowfamous shrine.”2
Tigers arenaturally toofierce tobetracked bythe
Malays, and are usually caught inspecially con-

ofthis lady’s wants, andwasdirected

thePawang explains tothetiger that itwasnothe

ever, asmight beexpected, agreat number ofcharms
intended toprotect thedevotee invarious ways from
the tiger’s claws and teeth. Ofthese Iwillgiveone
ortwotypical specimens.
Sometimes acharm isused tokeep thetiger ata
distance(penjauh rimau ):—
“Ho,Bersenu !Ho,Berkaih !

(Itwas)Sheikh Abuniah Lahah AbuKasap.

Sometimes thedesired effect isexpected tobe
obtained byacharm forlocking thetiger’s jaws:—
“Ho, SirCruncher !Ho, SirMuncher !
Letthetwigbreak under theweight ofthewild goose.
Fast shutandlocked be(your jaws), byvirtue of‘AliMustapah,
OM. Thus Ibreak (thetusks of) allbeasts thataretusked,
Byvirtue ofthisPrayer from theLand ofSiam.”2
1The explanation given tomeof
these twolineswasthattheywere both
based onafancied resemblance between
theparts referred to.
2Asimilar charm runs, “Madam

follow afewwords ofArabic.) On
reaching home youmust never forget
tounlock thetiger’s jaws, or“hewillcertainly bearagrudge against you !”
Todothisyoumust repeat theArabic
words with which thecharm (just
quoted) concluded, andthenpronounce
theMalay word buka, which means
“open.” The Malays arefond of
enigmatical expressions, inwhich the
partofaword ismade tostand forthe
whole. Cp.infra “Teng [stands for]
theSatengteng flower.” Sometimes
these expressions arepropounded as

public reception wasformerly always accorded tohim
onhisreturn tothevillage.

Anthropomorphic ideas areheldbytheMalays
almost asstrongly inthecase oftheDeer asofany

form ofthislegend SirWilliam Maxwell writes as
follows:—
“The deer(rusa)issometimes believed tobethe
metamorphosed body ofamanwho hasdied ofan
abscess intheleg(chctbuk),because ithasmarks on
thelegswhich aresupposed toresemble those caused
bythedisease mentioned. Ofcourse there arenot
wanting men ready todeclare thatthebody ofaman
whohasdied ofchabuk hasbeen seen torisefrom
thegrave and togoaway intotheforest intheshape
ofadeer.”1
TheSelangor legend ispractically identical with
thatcurrent inPerak.
The deer arefrequently addressed, inthecharms
usedbythehunters, exactly asiftheywerehuman
beings, eg.—
“Ifyouwish towear bracelets andrings
Stretch outyourtwo fore-feet.”
These rings and bracelets areofcourse thenooses
which depend from the toils.
Inacharm ofsimilar import wefind:—
“Ho,Crown Prince (Raja Muda) with your Speckled Princess
(Ptitri Dandi),
Rouse youquickly (from your slumbers)
And clasp (round yourneck) King Solomon’s necklace.”
Imayaddthat insome places theP(twang (magi-
cian) willhimself first enter the toils, probably with
theobject ofdeceiving thestag astotheir nature and
purpose.

frustrate their sportbyplacing insurmountable obstacles

teeth ofthelower jaw. Laythese sticks inatriangular form in-
side the slotofthe stag, press the leftthumb downwards inthe
centre ofthetriangle, andhumble your heart. This willhumble
thedeer’s heart too.”
TheMouse-deer orchevrotin isthe“BrerRabbit”
oftheMalays. Itfigures inmany proverbial sayings
andromances, inwhich itiscredited with extraor-
dinary sagacity, and ishonoured bythetitleof“Mentri

thereason may be,there isnodoubt that themethod
isoften successful.

charms used aresimilar tothose used forcalling the

But attheendofthecharm isadded, “Ini-lah

The stickwhich isusedmaybeofanykind of

operation iswhere theground sounds hollow when
tapped. Either three, five, orseven leaves must,
however, belaidonthespot before thetapping is

Hunting-Dogs
Hunting-dogs arespoken tocontinually asifthey
werehuman beings. Several examples ofthisoccur
inthedeercharms.
Thuswefind thefollowing passage addressed to
thedogs:—
“Letnotgothescent,
Formidable wereyoufrom the first;
Hot-foot, hot-foot, doyoupursue,
Ifyoudonotpursue hot-foot,
Iwillminimise mybenediction (lit.my4Peace bewithyou ’).
Ifit(thedeer) beabuck, you shallhavehim forabrother;
Ifitbeadoe,you shallhave herforawife.”
Sotoo,again, after calling several dogsbyname,
thePawang getstogether theaccessories (leaves ofthe
tukas andlenjuang,abrush ofleaves(sa-cherek)anda
black cloth), andexclaims:—
44Bark, SirSlender-foot;bark, SirBrush-tail.”
ThePawang generally tries todeceive thedeer as
tohisownership ofthehunting-dogs. Thus hewill
say:—


182 BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS CHAP.
“ItisnotIwhose dogs these are,
Itisthemagical deerPawang whose dogs these are.”
So,too,they arecalled bycertain specific names
(according totheir breed and colour), which are in
several cases identical with thenames ofthedogs
with which thewild Spectre Huntsman (themost
terrible ofallpersonified diseases intheMalay cate-
gory) huntsdown hisprey .1
Ugliness isbynomeans looked upon asadis-
advantage, butrather theopposite. Anuglydog is
apparently formidable. Thuswefindadogaddressed
asfollows :—
“Letnotgothescent (ofthequarry)
Asyouwere formidable (lit.ugly)2from the first.”
Again, thedescription ofthe“good points” of
some ofthese dogswhich isgiven intheAppendix
would, ifugliness and formidability areconvertible
terms, satisfy themost exacting whipper-in, theso-
called good points being forthemost part amere
listofdeformities. These points, however, aremerely
theexternal sign oftheLuck towhich dogs, aswell
ashuman beings, arebelieved tobeborn. Ina
finepassage wearetold:—
“From theseven Hillsandtheseven Valleys
Comes theintense barking ofmyDogs.
MyDogs areDogs ofLuck,
NotLuck that isadventitious,
ButLuck incarnate with their bodies.
Gotreadupon theheaped androtting leaves,
And never desert thescent.”
Speaking ofdog-lore generally, itmayberemarked
thatthough dogs arevery frequently kept bythe

TheSiamang (Hylobates lar),2which walks on its

commonly associated inlegend with thehuman race;
infact, itisnotimpossible that theremaysometimes

Once upon atime herHighness thePrincess
Telan became the affianced bride ofSiMalim
Bongsu. After the betrothal SiMalim Bongsu
sailed away anddidnotreturn when theperiod of
theengagement, which was fixed atfrom three to
fourmonths, came toanend.
Then SiMalim Panjang, elder brother ofSi
Malim Bongsu, decided totake theplace ofhis
younger brother, and bemarried tothePrincess
Telan. The latter, however, repelled hisadvances,
andhetherefore attacked hersavagely;butshe

2There seems tobesome doubt as
tothe scientific nomenclature properly
applicable totheSiamang.
The following isaspecimen ofa
monkey legend :“A little farther up-
stream tworocks facing each other, one
oneach sideofthe river, aresaid to
havebeen theforts oftwo rival tribes
ofmonkeys, theMawah {Simla lar)
andtheSiamang(Simla syndactyla), in
aterrible warwhich waswaged between
them inabygone age.TheSiamangs
defeated their adversaries, whom they
have ever since confined totherightbank ofthe river. Ifanymatter of
factperson should doubt thetruth of
this tradition, arethere nottwo facts
forthediscomfiture ofscepticism—the
monkey forts (called BatuMawah to
thisday) threatening each other from
opposite banks ofthe river, andthe
assurance ofallPerak Malays thatno

3According toanother account, the
siamang issaid tohave originated
from akarpulai,i.e.theroots ofa
pulai tree (theMalay substitute for
cork, used toform floats forthefishing-
nets).

thejungle, sothat SiMalim Panjang desisted from
pursuit. Then theapeclimbed upinto apagar-
anak treewhich grew onthesea-shore, andleaned
over thesea,andthere shechanted these words:—
“OmydearMalim Bongsu,
Youhavebroken yoursolemn promise andengagement,
And Ihave totakeupon myself theform ofanape.”
Now SiMalim Bongsu waspassing atthetime,
andonrecognising thevoice ofthePrincess Telan he
took ablow-gun andshothersothatshe fellintothe
sea.Then hetook rose-water andsprinkled itover
her,sothatsheresumed hernatural shape, andthey
started togohome together. Still, however, Si
Malim Bongsu would notwed her,butpromised that
hewould dosowhen hecame back from hisnext
voyage, whereupon the Princess chanted these
words:—
“Ifyoudonotreturn within threemonths
You willfindmeturned intoanape.”
Thesame course ofevents, however, happened as
before. Malim Bongsu didnotreturn atthetime
appointed;hiselder brother, Malim Panjang once
more attacked her, and, leaping towards anareca
palm, sheoncemore became anape,whereupon she
chanted asbefore:—
“OmydearMalim Bongsu,
Youhavebroken yoursolemn promise andengagement,
And Iamforced tobecome anape.”
Again Malim Bongsu, ashepassed by,heard and
recognised hervoice;butupon learning thathehad

Occasionally theopposite transformation isbelieved
totake place, some species ofthemonkey tribe being

Thus theBra (.Macacus cynomolgus) isbelieved to

“cocoa-nut monkey.”

TheWildPigandOther Animals
There areseveral superstitions about theWild
Boarwhich prove that itwasnotalways regarded as
anunclean animal.
Ofthese thefollowing recipe, which wasgiven
mebyaJugra (Selangor) Malay, forturning brass
intogold isthemost remarkable:—
“Killawild pigand ripopen itspaunch. Sew
upinthisaquantity ofold‘scrap’brass, piletimber
over it,burn it,andthen leave italone until thegrass
hasgrown right over it.Then digupthegold.”
Again, certain wild boars arebelieved tocarry on
their tushes atalisman ofextraordinary power, which
iscalled rantei babi,or“Wild Boar’s Chain.”
This chain consists, itisasserted, ofthree links of
various metals (gold, silver, andamalgam), and is
hung uponashrub bythewild boarwhen he is

enjoying hiswallow, sothat itisoccasionally stolen
byMalays whoknow hishabits. Imayadd that,
according toaMalay atLangat, the“were-tiger”
{rimau jadi-jadiait) occasionally appears intheshape
ofawildboar escaping from agrave, inthecentre
ofwhich maybeafterwards seen theholebywhich
theanimal hasescaped.
“Among themodern Malays avoidance oftheflesh
ofswine andofcontact withanything connected with
theunclean animal is,ofcourse, universal. Notenet
ofEl- 1slam ismore rigidly enforced than this. Itis
singular tonotice, among apeople governed bythe
ordinances oftheProphet, traces oftheobservance
ofanother form ofabstinence enjoined byadifferent
religion. The universal preference ofthe flesh of
theBuffalo tothat oftheOxinMalay countries is
evidently aprejudice bequeathed tomodern times
byaperiod when cow-beefwas asmuch anabomina-
tion toMalays as itistotheHindus ofIndia at
thepresent day. This isnotadmitted orsuspected
byordinary Malays, whowould probably havesome

andcow-beef, toallege indefence oftheir preference

Totheabove Imayaddthat itisinvariably the
flesh oftheBuffalo, andnotthatoftheOx,which is
eaten sacrificially ontheoccasion offestivities.2But
the flesh oftheso-called White (albino) Buffalo
(kerbau balar) isgenerally avoided asfood, though I

detailed elsewhere).1
Asmight beexpected, astory is
toldbytheMalays toaccount forthisdistinction. The
general outline ofthetale istotheeffect thataMalay
boy (amere child) fellintothebigrice-bin(kepok)in
hisparents’ absence andwas suffocated bythe rice.
After some days thebody began todecompose, and
theoozeemanating from therice-bin waslicked upby
abuffalo belonging totheboy’s parents. The atten-
tionofthese latter being thus attracted totherice-bin,
they found therein theremains oftheir child, and
thereupon cursed the buffalo, which (we areledto
infer) became“white,” andhasremained soever
since. According toone version, aground -dove
(tekukur)
wasimplicated both intheoffence andthe
punishment which followed it.Wherefore tothis
daynoman eatsoftheflesh ofeither oftheoffenders.
Perhaps themost extraordinary transformation
inwhich theMalays implicitly believe isthat ofthe
Squirrel, which issupposed tobedeveloped from a
large caterpillar called ulatsentadu?
About theCatthere aremany superstitions which
show that itisbelieved topossess supernatural

2Imayadd that thedried penis of
thesquirrel (rhula tupei) isbelieved to
beamost powerful aphrodisiac, and
thatmany Malays believe thatsquirrels
areoccasionally found dead with this
organ caught fastincleft timber.
Mr.H.N.Ridley, inapamphlet on
Malay Materia Medica,already referred
to,says
“Many things areused asaphro-disiacs bythe natives. . . .Among
them aretheovipositor ofagrass-
hopper, which ispopularly supposed to
bethemale organ ofthe squirrel;

useofBalanophora forthispurpose as
an illustration ofthe“doctrine of

V IDEAS ABOUT CATS 191
master .1Ontheother hand, catsmust bevery
carefully prevented fromrubbing upagainst acorpse,
for itissaid thatononeoccasion when thiswas
neglected, thebadi orEvil Principle which resides
inthe cat’sbody entered intothecorpse, which thus
became endowed with unnatural lifeandstood up
upon itsfeet. Sotoothesoaking ofthecatinapan
ofwater until itishalf-drowned isbelieved toproduce
anabundance ofrain .2Itis,besides, believed tobe
extremely unlucky tokill cats. Ofthis superstition
Mr.Clifford says:—
“It isacommon belief among Malays that ifa
cat iskilled hewho takes itslife will inthenext
world becalled upon tocarry and pilelogs ofwood,
asbigascocoa-nut trees, tothenumber ofthehairs
onthebeast’s body. Therefore cats arenotkilled;
but iftheybecome toodaring intheir raids onthe
hen-coop orthefood rack, they aretiedtoaraftand
sent floating down stream, toperish miserably of
hunger. The people ofthevillages bywhich they
passmake haste topush the raft outagain into
mid-stream, should itinitspassage adhere tobank
orbathing- hut,andonnoaccount istheanimal
suffered toland. Toanyonewho thinks about it,
thislongandlingering death isinfinitely more cruel
than onecaused byablow from anaxe;butthe
Malays donottrouble toconsider such adetail, and
would care little ifthey did.”3
Before leaving thesubject ofcats, Imust mention
thebelief thatthe“fresh-water fishcalled ikan belidah”
was“originally acat.” SirW.E.Maxwell says that
many Malays refuse toeat itforthis reason, and
1VideJ.R.A.S., S.B., l.c.

192 BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS CHAP.
adds, “They declare that itsqualls like acatwhen
harpooned, and that itsbones arevery white and
fine likeacat’s hairs.”1Astory isalsosometimes
told toaccount both forthegeneral similarity ofhabits
ofthecatandthetigerandforthefactthatthelatter,
unlike most oftheFelicia,isnotatree-climber. It
istotheeffect that thecatagreed toteach thetiger
itstricks, which itdid,with theexception oftheart
ofclimbing trees. The tiger, thinking ithad learnt
allthe cat’s tricks, proceeded toattack itsteacher,
when thecatescaped byclimbing upatree;sothe
tigernever learnt how toclimb andcannot climb trees
tothisday.
Even thesmallest andcommonest ofmammals, such
asRatsandMice, aretheobjects ofmany strange
beliefs. Thus “clothes which have been nibbled by
ratsormicemust notbeworn again. They aresure
tobring misfortune, andaregenerally given away in
charity.”2
SotooontheSelangor coast amollusc called siput
tantarang ormentarang isbelieved tohave sprung
from amouse;andmany kinds ofcharms, generally
addressed tothe“Prophet Joseph”(Nabi Yusuf), are
resorted toinorder todriveaway ratsandmicefrom
therice-fields.
Thefollowing passage describes thegeneral ideas
about animal superstitions which prevail ontheeast
coast ofthePeninsula:—
“The beliefs andsuperstitions oftheFisher Folk
would fillmany volumes. They believe inallmanner
ofdevils and local sprites. They fear greatly the
demons that preside over animals, and will not
willingly mention thenames ofbirds orbeasts while

tothem, signifies ananimal, though toothers itis
meaningless, and issupposed nottobeunderstanded
ofthe beasts. To thisword they tack onthe
sound which each beast makes inorder toindicate
what animal isreferred to;thus thepig isthe
grunting cheweh,thebuffalo thecMweh thatsays‘uak,’
andthesnipe thecheweh that cries‘kek-kek.

tothe people. But theFisher Folk, like other

words, from theanalogy oftheAnimal Spirit. Itis
difficult tosay,without amore searching inquiry than
Ihave yethadtheopportunity ofmaking, whether
Malay magicians would maintain that alltrees had
souls(semangat)
ornot. Allthatwecanbecertain
ofatpresent isthatagoodmany trees arecertainly
supposed bythem tohave souls, such, forinstance, as
theDurian, theCocoa-nut palm, andthetreeswhich
produce Eagle-wood(gharu),Gutta Percha, Camphor,
andagoodmany others.
What canbemore significant than thewords and
actions ofthemenwho informer dayswould tryand
frighten theDurian groves intobearing;orofthe
toddy-collector whoaddresses thesouloftheCocoa-nut
palm insuchwords as,“Thus Ibend your neck,
and rollupyour hair;andhere ismyivory toddy-
knife tohelp thewashing ofyour face”;

collectors ofjungle produce who traffic inEagle-
wood, Camphor, andGutta (the spirits ofthe first
twoofwhich trees areconsidered extremely powerful
anddangerous) or,above all,ofthereapers whocarry

Aspecial point inconnection with theMalay con-
ception ofthevegetation soulperhaps requires par-
ticular attention, viz.thefactthatapparently deadand
even seasoned timber mayyetretain thesoulwhich
animated itduring itslifetime. Thus, theinstruc-
tions fortheperformance oftherites tobeused atthe

Mali mali,Rotan jernang (Dragon’s-blood rattan),
Buluh kasap (rough bamboo), etc., are allsaid to
supply instances oftheconcretions referred to,butthe
mostfamous ofthem alliswithout doubt theso-called
“cocoa-nut pearl,” ofwhich Iquote thefollowing
account from Dr.Denys’s Descriptive Dictionary of
British Malaya.
Cocoa-nut Pearls
The following remarks concerning these peculiar
accretions areextracted fromNature :—
“During myrecent travels,” Dr.Sidney Hickson
writes toascientific contemporary, “Iwasfrequently
asked bytheDutch planters andothers ifIhadever
seen‘acocoa-nut stone.’ These stones aresaid to

ofthecocoa-nut, andwhen found arekeptbythe
natives asacharm against disease and evil spirits.
This story ofthecocoa-nut stone wassoconstantly
toldme,and inevery case without anyvariation in
itsdetails, that Imade every effort before leaving to
obtain some specimens, andeventually succeeded in
obtaining two.
“Oneofthese isnearly aperfect sphere, 14mm.
indiameter, andtheother, rather smaller insize, is
irregularly pear-shaped. Inboth specimens thesur-
face isworn nearly smooth byfriction. The spherical
one Ihave hadcutintotwohalves, but Icanfindno
concentric orother markings onthepolished cut
surfaces.
“Dr.Kimmins haskindly submitted one-half toa
careful chemical analysis, andfinds that itconsists of
pure carbonate oflimewithout anytrace ofother salts
orvegetable tissue.
“Ishould bevery glad ifanyofyour readers
could inform me ifthere areanyofthese stones in
any ofthemuseums, or ifthere isanyevidence
beyond mere hearsay oftheir existence inthe peri-
sperm ofthecocoa-nut.”1
On this letter Mr.Thiselton Dyer makes the
following remarks:—“Dr.Hickson’s account ofthe

“The circumstances oftheoccurrence ofthese

those which attend theformation oftabasheer. In
both cases mineral matter inpalpable masses iswith-
drawn from solution inconsiderable volumes offluid

and inboth instances they aremonocotyledons.
“In thecaseofthecocoa-nut pearls thematerial

V LEGEND OFTHESTICK-INSECT 201
Once upon atime amarried couple fellout,and
thehusband surreptitiously introduced stones intothe
cooking-pot inplace oftheyams which hiswifewas
cooking. Then hewent offtoclimb foracocoa-nut,
and asheclimbed, hemocked herbycalling out
“Masak belum ?Masak belum ?”(“Are theycooked
yet ?Are they cooked yet ?”).What shedidby
wayofretaliation isnotclear, butasheclimbed and
mocked her,she issaid tohave retorted, “Panjat
belum? Panjat belum?”(“Have youclimbed it
yet? Have youclimbed ityet?”), areply which
clearly shows thatherwoman’s withadbeen atwork,
andthatshewasnotgoing toallow herhusband to
getthe better ofher .1However thismay be,
adeadlock ensued, the result ofwhich was that
both parties were transformed into stick -insects,
butwere yetcondemned tomock each other as
they haddone during theperiod oftheirhuman
existence.
Ihave often frommyboat, during dark nights on
theLangat river, listened totheweird notewhichmy
Malays invariably ascribed tothese insects, andwhich
isnotinaptly represented byoneoftheMalay names
forthem, viz.“belum-belam” Ihave not yet,how-
ever, succeeded inidentifying therealproducer ofthe
note, ofwhich all Icansayatpresent is,thatalthough
itmaynotbeitself discoverable, theMalays lookupon

TheTualang orSialang Tree
SotoooftheTualang-tree Mr.Wray writes:—
“One ofthelargest and stateliest oftheforest
trees inPerak isthatknown asToallong, orToh
Allong;1ithasaverypoisonous sap,which produces
great irritation when itcomes incontact with theskin.
TwoChinamen whohad felled oneofthese trees in
ignorance, hadtheir faces soswelled andinflamed that
they could notseeoutoftheir eyes,andhadtobeled
about forsome days before theyrecovered from the
effects ofthepoison. Their arms, breasts, andfaces
were affected, andthey presented theappearance of
having averybadattack oferysipelas. These trees
aresupposed tobetheabiding -places ofhantu,or
spirits, when theyhave large hollow projections from
thetrunk, calledrumah hantu,orspirit houses. These
projections areformed when abranch getsbroken off
near thetrunk, andarequite characteristic ofthetree.
There aresometimes three orfour ofthem onalarge
tree,andtheMalays have agreat objection tocutting
down anythataresodisfigured, thebelief being that
ifaman fellsonehewilldiewithin theyear. Asa
rulethese trees are leftstanding when clearings are
made, andthey areasource oftrouble andexpense to
planters and others, who object totheir being left
uncut.
“The following series ofevents actually happened:—AMalay named Panda Tambong undertook, against
theadvice ofhisfriends, tofelloneoftheTohAllong
trees, andhealmost immediately afterwards wastaken
illwith fever, anddied inafewweeks’ time. Shortly

after thissomemenwere sitting plaiting ataps1under
theshade ofanother ofthese ill-omened trees, when,
without anywarning, alarge branch felldown, breaking
thearm ofoneman, andmore orlessinjuring two
others. There wasnotabreath ofwind atthetime,
oranything else likely todetermine the fallofthe
branch. After this itwasdecided tohave thetree
felled, asthere were coolie houses nearly under it.
There wasgreat difficulty ingetting anyonetofell it.
Eventually aPenang Malay undertook thejob,but
stipulated that aPawang,orsorcerer, should be
employed todrive away thedemons first. The
Pawang hung pieces ofwhite andredclothonsticks
round thetree,burnt incense inthe little contrivances
made ofthesplit leaf-stalks ofthebertam palm, used
bytheMalays forthat purpose, cutofftheheads of
twowhite fowls, sprinkled theblood over thetrunk,
and inthemidst ofmany incantations thetreewas
felled without anymishap;but,strange tosay, the
Pawang,whowasahajp andaslave-debtor ofthe
TohPuan Halimah, died about ninemonths after-
wards.”3
There appears tobevery little reason todoubt
that theword Tualang (’TohAlang orSia/ang) isthe
name notofaparticular species oftree,butrather the
generic name ofalltrees inwhich wildbeeshave built
their nests, sothat inreality itsimply means a“Bee-

most usually the collectors. Some ofthese latter,
however, were pureMalay charms, andmayperhaps
beconsidered, intheabsence ofcharms collected from

Oneofthese charms commences asfollows:—

Other haunted trees(pokok berhantu) arethe

“All trees,” according toMalay tradition, “were
planted by‘the Prophet Elias,’1and are inthe
‘Prophet Noah’s’ charge. Inthedays ofKing
Solomon, trees could speak aswell asbirds and
animals, andseveral ofthetreesnow tobeseen in
the forest arereally metamorphosed human beings.
Such arethe‘Jelotong’ andthe‘Berombong,’ which
inthedays ofKing Solomon werebosom friends,
until there broke outbetween them anunfortunate
quarrel, which terminated in‘SiJelotong’s’ lacing the
skinof‘SiBerombong’allover with stabs from his
dagger, the effect ofwhich stabs remains visible to
thisday. SiBerombong, ontheother hand, cursed
SiJelotong with hisdying breath, praying thathe
might beturned intoatreewithout anybuttresses to

V THECAMPHOR SPIRIT 213
“ThisCamphor language isfirstreferred tobyMr.
Logan inhisaccount oftheaboriginal tribes ofthe
Malay Peninsula,1andhegives alistofeighty
words, thirty-three ofwhich areMalay orderived
from Malay.”
“The Jakuns believe that there isa“bisan” or
spirit, which presides over thecamphor-trees, and
without propitiating this spirit itisimpossible to
obtain thecamphor. This bisan makes atnight
ashrill noise, andwhen thissound isheard itisa
suresign that there arecamphor- trees near athand.
(This bisan isreally oneoftheCicadas which are
sonumerous intheMalayan jungles.)
“When hunting forcamphor thenatives always
throw aportion oftheir foodoutintothejungle before
eating, asanoffering tothebisan.
“No prayers areoffered up,but allfoodmust be
eaten dry, i.e.without sumbul,2orstewed fish,orvege-
tables. Saltmust notbepounded fine;ifitiseaten
fine,thecamphor when found willbeinfinegrains;
but ifeaten coarse thegrains ofcamphor willbelarge.
Inrainy weather thecryofthebisan isnotheard.
Atcertain seasons regular parties ofJakuns, and
sometimes Malays, gointothejungle tosearch for
camphor, andtheyremain there aslong asthree or
fourmonths atatime. Notonlymust themenwho
gointothejungle tosearch forthecamphor speak
the‘Pantang Kapur,’ butalso themenandwomen

“TheCamphor language consists ingreat partof
words which areeither Malay orofMalay origin, but

V THEGUTTA-PERCHA SPIRIT 215
Gutta-percha
The trees fromwhich Gutta-percha istaken are
alsosupposed tobeinhabited byaspirit;but this,
theGutta- spirit, being farlessdangerous than the
Eagle-wood spirit, fewer precautions aretaken in
dealing with it.Intheinvocation addressed tothe
Gutta-spirit, thepetitioner asks fortheboon ofa
drop ofthe spirit’s blood, which ofcourse isan
indirect wayofasking forthetree’s sap.
Here isaspecimen ofthecharms used bythe
gutta-collectors:—
“Ho,Prince S’riBali,

TheCocoa-nut Palm
Thefollowing instructions tobefollowed bytoddy-
collectors (who taptheCocoa-nut palm for itsjuice,
which isboiled into sugar) were given mebya
Kelantan Malay (’Che ‘Abas ofKlanang):—
“When you areabout tosetfoot against the
base ofthetrunk(i.e .tostart climbing) repeat these
lines:—
“Peace bewith you,OAbubakar!
Drowse notasyoukeepwatch andward intheheart ofthistree
(limbi').”
Here climb half-way upandsay:—
“Peace bewith you, Little Sister, Handmaiden Bidah,
Drowse notasyoukeep watch andward inthemiddle ofthe
trunk,
Come andaccompany meonmywayupthis tree.”
Here climb upamong the leaf-stalks, layhold ofthe
central shoot, give itthree shakes, andsay—
“Peace bewith you, Little Sister, Youngest ofthePrincesses,
Drowse notasyoukeepwatch andward over thecentral shoot,
Doyouaccompany meonmywaydown this tree.”
Nowcommence bybending down oneoftheblossom-
sheaths, layhold ofthe central shoot, and thrice
repeat thefollowing lines:—
“Peace bewithyourHighnesses, Princesses oftheShorn Hairand

turns either towards himself orthebase ofthe tree,
orwhether itlooks away from both. Intheformer
case theseed willbegood, inthe latter itisnot
worth planting.
Plant Rice intheearly morning, about five,because
that isthehour atwhich infants (theRice Soul being
considered asaninfant) getup.
TheCultivation ofRice
Themost important contribution oftheMalays
totheanimistic theory ofvegetation isperhaps tobe
found inthemany strange ceremonies with which
they surround the culture ofRice. Inorder to
properly understand thesignificance ofthese cere-
monies, however, aproper understanding ofthe
Malay system ofrice -planting isessential, and I
therefore quote inextenso adescription ofrice-
culture, which possesses the additional interest of
being translated from thecomposition ofaMalay :1—

“In starting planting operations, however, the

arefrequent rains, andaccordingly theearth ofthe

inplanting rice itisaninvariable rulethatthere must

“2.Inolden time theorder ofplanting operations

Pawang,wasburned;then alltherequisites forrice-

elicited thestatement that thehantu inquestion was

asmall sapling with theleaves andbranches lefton it
andovershadowing theplatform, thesides ofwhich
appeared toface accurately towards thefour cardinal

aboriginal tribes ofCentral Indiawhohave notbeen
converted toHinduism orIslam. That itshould exist
inaMalay community within twenty miles ofthetown
ofMalacca, where Muhammadanism hasbeen estab-
lished forabout six1centuries, iscertainly strange. Its
obvious inconsistency with hisprofessed religion does
notstrike theaverage Malay peasant atall. Itis,
however, thefact that these observances arenot re-
garded withmuch favour bythemore strictly
Muhammadan Malays ofthetowns, and especially by
those thatarepartially ofArab descent. These latter
have notmuch influence incountry districts, but
privately Ihave heard some ofthem express dis-
approval ofsuch ritesandeven oftheceremonies
performed atkramats. According tothem, thelatter
might beconsistent withMuhammadan orthodoxy on
theunderstanding thatprayers were addressed solely
totheDeity;buttheinvocation ofspirits ordeceased
saints andtheir propitiation byofferings could notbe
regarded asotherwise than polytheistic idolatry. Of
course such adelicate distinction—almost assubtle as
thatbetween dulia andlatria intheChristian worship
ofsaints—isentirely beyond theaverage Malay mind;
andeverything issanctioned byimmemorial custom,
which inanagricultural population ismore deeply-
rooted thananybook-learning;sothese ritesarelikely
tocontinue forsome time,and willonly yield gradually
tothespread ofeducation. Such asthey are,theyseem
tobeinteresting relics ofanold-world superstition.

apart inMalay magic ceremonies, andabrushmade
upoftheleaves ofseven different plants, bound up
asusual with acord ofkulit t'rap (thebark ofthe
Wild Breadfruit), andribu-rifat (akindofsmall creeper).
The plants which supplied theleaves ofwhich the
brush wascomposed, were asfollows:—
1.Sapenoh. 2.Sapanggil.3.Jenjuang (orlen-

andabout fourteen inches long, which wasstanding
just infront ofthethree rice-baskets andclose tothe
Pawang,andwhich, as Iafterwards found out,was
intended toserve asthecradle oftheRice-soul (or
“Rice-baby ”). Iexamined it,however, andfound
that asyet itonlycontained thefollowing objects:—
1.Astrip ofwhite cloth (folded upand lying atthebottom of
thebasket).
2.Some parti-coloured thread(benang panchazvarna orpancha-

3.Ahen’s egg.

wastobeslung round theneck ofitsbearer. (The cor-
recter custom would require anexpensive cloth ofthe
kind called jong sarat,orthe“Loaded Junk,” accord-

Three newMalay skirts orsarongs were added,
(one toeach basket), andeverything being ready, the
various receptacles described above were entrusted to
fivefemale bearers(Penjawat),whodescended from
thehouse, with thePawang attheir head, andsetout
fortherice-field. Before theyhadgonemany yards

kind ofsugar-cane, which wasused insubstitution
fortheblack or“raven”variety(tebugagak) which,
thePawang explained, would have been used inpre-
ference ifithadbeen obtainable. Meanwhile the
procession passed on,and thePawang repeated as
wewent thefollowing prayer tothespirits:—

Then forafewmoments shestood still, close tothe

Oneofthefemale bearers nowplanted thestem ofthe
sugar-cane upright inthecentre ofthesheaf,1whilst

Here thePawang andPenjawat (Female Bearer),
together proceeded toplant thesugar-cane inthe

round thesugar-cane) drew thewaist ofthesheaf
together andbelted itwithsome oftheouter stems of

whowhen reaping stripped herself bare from the
waist upwards, andwhen askedwhyshedidsosaid

IntheWestern States ofthePeninsula byfarthe
most important branch ofindustry hasformany years
been thatofTin-mining. Though something like90
percentofthelabourers employed inthemines are
Chinese, theceremonies used attheopening oftin-
mines arepurely Malay incharacter.
Thepostofmining wizard, once ahighly lucrative
one,was inpastdaysalmost always filledbyaMalay,
though occasionally theservices ofaJungle -man
[Sakai) would bepreferred. These mining wizards
enjoyed intheirpalmy days anextraordinary reputa-
tion,some ofthem being credited with thepower of
bringing oretoaplace where itwasknown thatno
oreexisted;some, too,were believed topossess the
power ofsterilising such oreasexisted, andofturning
itintomere grains ofsand.
Theoreitself isregarded asendued notonlywith
vitality, butalsowith thepower ofgrowth, oreof
indifferent quality being regarded astooyoung(muda),
butaslikely toimprove with age. Sometimes, again,
itisdescribed asresembling abuffalo, inwhich shape
itisbelieved tomake itswayfrom place toplace
underground. This idea, however, isprobably based
upon traditions ofalode,though itisquite inkeeping
oftheceremonies described. The
ceremonies, however, arecomparatively
homogeneous inallparts ofthePenin-

Appendix (xciii. seqq .),willbefound a
number ofinvocations, collected by
Mr.O’Sullivan andmyself, which are

minerals, theGold spirit being supposed totake the
shape ofakijang orroe-deer (whence thetradition
ofagolden roe-deer being found atRaub inPahang).
Inconnection with thesubject oftin-mining the
account contributed1in1885byMr.Abraham Hale
(then Inspector ofMines intheKinta district of
Perak) totheJournal oftheStraits Asiatic Society isof
suchvalue astonecessitate itsbeing quoted inextenso.
Itwillbefollowed bysuch notes upon mining invoca-
tions as Iwasable tocollect inSelangor, afterwhich
afewremarks upon theMalay theory ofanimism in
minerals generally willbring thesubject toaconclusion.
Tocommence with Mr.Hale’s account:—“The
valley oftheKinta is,andhasbeen foraverylong
time, essentially amining country. There are inthe
district nearly fivehundred registered mines, ofwhich
three areworked byEuropean Companies, the rest
being either private mines, i.e.mines claimed by
Malays, which have beenworked bythem and their
ancestors foranindefinite period, ornewmines, in
other words new concessions given indifferently on
application toMalays andChinese. There areabout
three hundred and fiftyprivate Malay mines, and itis
with these principally that thefollowing paper will
deal.
“So far,nolodes have been discovered inKinta;
itis,however, probable that, asthecountry isopened
upandprospectors getupamongst thespurs ofthe
main range, thesources ofthestream tinwillcome to

“This stream tinhasprobably been worked for
several centuries inKinta;local tradition says that a

andthere isevidence thatvery extensive work has
been done here bysomebody atatimewhen the
method was different from thatwhich iscommonly
adopted byKinta Malays atthepresent day. There
areatleast fiftydeep well-like pitsontheLahat hill,
averaging about eight feet indiameter andperhaps
twenty feetdeep.
“Further upcountry Ihave seenalarge pitwhich

maybeconjectured from thevirgin forest inwhich it

“The Malay pawang, ormedicine-man, isprobably
theinheritor ofvarious remnants andtraditions ofthe
religion which preceded Muhammadanism, and in
theolden time thisclass ofpersons derived avery
fairrevenue from theexercise oftheir profession, in

aswell astheChinese miner, oftheoldschool, with
their thousand-and-one superstitions, hasgiven place
toamore modern and matter-of-fact race,whoplace
more reliance forprospecting purposes onboring tools
thanonthedivination andjampi ofthepawang.
Buttheprofession ofthepawang hasnotaltogether
died out,asheissometimes called into requisition for
thepurpose ofcasting outevil spirits from themines;
ofconverting amang1(pyrites) into tin -ore,andof
invoking thespirits ofamine previous tothebreaking
ofthe firstsodinanew venture. These ceremonies
generally involve theslaying ofabuffalo, agoat, or
fowls, andtheoffering ofbetel-leaf, incense, and rice,
according tothemeans ofthetowkay lombong.
“Thetermpawang isnowusedbytheChinese
toindicate the‘smelter’ (Chinese) ofamine (prob-
ablyfrom thefact that this office wasformerly the
monopoly oftheMalay pazvang).
“To thepawangs are attributed extraordinary
powers, forbesides inducing tin-ore tocontinue or
become plentiful inamine, hecancause itsdisappear-
ancefrom arich‘claim’bytheinevitable jampi,this
latter resource being resorted tobyway ofrevenge
incases where thetowkay lombong (orlabor) fails
tocarry out hispecuniary obligation towards the

times. Some ofthestories toldoftheprowess of
pawangs arevery ridiculous;forinstance, anative

The failure oftheSungei Jelok mines wasattributed
toherdispleasure onaccount ofanalleged breach of

“Thetermpawang issometimes used asaverb
inthesense of‘toprospect’asungei orstream;
thus inalluding tocertain streams ormines, itisnot
uncommon tohear aMalay saythattheyhavebeen
prospected(sudah di-pawangkan)by‘Inche’ So-and-
so—meaning that thestream hadbeen discovered
andproved byapawang prior totheopening ofthe

itspresence byapeculiar noise heard inthe stillness

abouts.”3
Inastilllater article, after briefly referring tothe
useofthebhasa pantang,or“Taboo Language,”
bytin-miners inSelangor, Mr.Pasqual proceeds:—
“There are,again, certain actswhich areforbidden.
Inthemine, especially ifthekarang4hasnotyetbeen

umbrella. This rule, itseems, originated with the
coolies themselves, who inolden times insisted thatthe

Theremaining notes onmining ceremonies and
charms were collected bymeinSelangor. Onreach-
ingthetin-bearing stratum, thetin-ore isaddressed
byname:—
“Peace bewith you,OTin-Ore,

Sometimes each grain oforeappears tobecon-

ality. Thuswefind inanother invocation thefollowing
passage, where thewizard isaddressing thegrains of

(4)Toinduce the spirits topartake ofabanquet
which isspread forthem inareceptacle intended
tobethemodel ofaroyal audience-chamber.
This, the “spirits’ audience-chamber” (as itis
called), isusually from two tothree feet square, and
isfilled with offerings similar incharacter tothose
usually deposited onthe sacrificial tray (anckafc), with
theaddition, however, ofcertain articles which are
considered tobespecially representative oftheminers’
food. These articles aresugar-cane, plantains, yams,
sweet potatoes, and fish, etc.;allofwhich should be
placed together with thecustomary offerings inthe
“spirits’ audience-chamber.” Outside the“audience-
hall,” ateach ofthetwo front corners, should be
placed aredandawhite flagandawaxtaper;andat
each ofthetwoback corners should beplaced ataper,
making inallfour flagsandseven tapers.
Astandard censer(perasapan)

front ofthe“audience-chamber,” andasecond small
censer must alsobeobtained, sothatburning incense
maybe“waved”toand frounderneath thefloor of
theaudience-chamber inorder tofumigate itbefore
theofferings aredeposited inside it.
During thefumigation acharm isrecited, inwhich
the assistance ofthe spirits ofcertain canonized
Muhammadan worthies isinvoked, concluding
thus:—
“Peace bewith you,OWhite Sheikh, wizard ofthevirgin
jungle,
Wizards old,andwizards young,
Come hither andshare thebanquet Ihave prepared foryou.
Icrave pardon forallmistakes,
For allshortcomings Ibegpardon inevery particular.”
Thenwhen thetapers are alllighted andtheoffer-

follows:—
“Ho,White Sheikh, king ofthevirgin jungle,
Itisyoutowhom belong allpeople ofthejungle andvirgin

Give your orders toalltheElders oftheearth andPrinces

Thechief taboos arethekilling ofanysortofliving
creature within themine;towear asarong (Malay
skirt);tobring intothemine theskinofanybeast;
andtowear shoes oruseanumbrella within themine.
These aresome oftheperpetual taboos, butnodoubt
there aremany others.
Inthecaseofasacrifice, however, thewhite buffalo
mayofcourse bekilled, notwithin themine itself, but
stillupon itsbrink;andwhen this isdone, thehead is
buried, andsmall portions (which must be“repre-
sentative” ofevery partofthecarcase) should betaken
anddeposited inthe“audience-chamber.”
Among theseven days’ taboos arementioned the
killing ofanyliving timber (within theprecincts ofthe
mine ?),lewdness, andthepraising oradmiring ofthe
“grass seed” {pttji buah rumput), which isthename
bywhich thetin-ore must invariably becalled within
theprecincts ofthemine. This lasttaboo isdueto
theuseofaspecial mining vocabulary towhich the
greatest attention wasformerly paid, andwhich did
notdiffer very greatly from thatused inPerak.

The foregoing descriptions ofmining ceremonies
andcharms refer totinonly, but insofarasgeneral
animistic ideas go,theymight beequally well applied
toother metals, such assilver andgold.
Ithasalready beenremarked thatastheTin spirit

Malays believe tobeessential forsuccessful gold-
mining, notmuch information hasyetbeen published.
InDenys’ Descriptive Dictionary,however, weread
thefollowing:—
“Gold isbelieved tobeunder thecareand inthe

The qualities ofthegold vary greatly inthesame
country. The finest goldbrought tomarket isthatof
theprincipality ofPahang, ontheeastern sideofthe
Malay Peninsula, which brings ahigher price than
even that ofAustralia bybetter than three percent.
Thegold isallobtained bywashing, andthemetal has
never been worked, and scarcely even traced tothe
original veins. Itismostly intheform ofpowder or
dust—themas-urai oftheMalays, literally1loose or
disintegrated gold.’”2
Gold, silver, andanamalgam formed ofthetwo,
areregarded asthethree most precious metals, andof
these gold is,toavery uncertain and partial extent,
stillsometimes regarded asaroyal prerogative .3
OfSilver still lessinformation hasbeen collected
than ofgold. This, however, isbutnatural, assilver
hasnotyetbeen found inpayable quantities, whereas
many goldmines exist. Itisjust possible, however,
that silvermaybeworked bytheMalays onasmall
scale intheSiamese- Malay States, asitwould bediffi-
cultonanyother hypothesis toaccount forthefollow-
inginvocation, which wasgivenmebyaMalay of
Kelantan (’Che ‘Abas):—

Noother metals, sofarasIamaware, areworked
toanyextent inthePeninsula, yetthere istheclearest
possible evidence ofanimistic ideas about Iron. Thus
fortheSacred Lump ofIronwhich forms partofthe
regalia ofmore thanoneofthepetty Sultans inthe
Peninsula, theMalays entertain themost extraordinary
reverence, notunmingled with superstitious terror .1It
isupon this“Lump ofIron,” when placed inwater,
thatthemostsolemn andbinding oathknown tothose
whomake useofitissworn;and itistothis“Lump of
Iron” thattheMalay wizard referswhen herecites his

mind atallevents, some connection between the
supernatural powers ascribed tothisportion ofthe
regalia andthemore general useofiron asacharm
against evil spirits. For thevarious forms ofiron
which play soconspicuous apart inMalay magic,
from thelong iron nailwhich equally protects the
new-born infant andtheRice-Soul from thepowers
ofevil, tothebetel-nut scissors which arebelieved to
scare theevil spirits from thedead, arealike called the

willoccasionally seathimself when heiseating alone

Even Stone appears toberegarded asdistinctly
connected with ideas ofanimism. Thus thestone
deposited inthebasket with theRice-soul, thestone
deposited inthe child’s swinging cotbyway ofa

ofit,andabove allthevarious concretions tobefound

(“Bezoar” stones) and inthestems orfruitoftrees
(astabasheer),areexamples ofthis. Examples of
tabasheer have already beenquoted (under Vegetation

“The part oftheisland which pro-

ance seems tobe,byacoincidence of
native reports, the district about the

necessity theymake useofthewaters
ofcertain springs, which must be
saline mineral springs, andwhich the
Kayans call‘Sungan.’ These springs
arealsofrequented bytroops ofthe
redmonkeys before mentioned, and
theBezoars aremost constantly found
inthestomachs ofthese animals
through their drinking thesaline water.
The hunters lieinwait about such
springs, and, soruns thereport, on
theanimals coming down todrink they
areable toguess with tolerable cer-
tainty from external signswhich ofthe
monkeys will afford theGuliga, and
they forthwith shoot such with their
sumpitans. Ihave thisaccount, curi-

originated from ideas ofceremonial purification.
2.THE SEA, RIVERS, ANDSTREAMS
TheMalays have been from timeimmemorial a
sea-faring race,andarequite assuperstitious intheir
ideas oftheseaassailors inother parts oftheworld.
Ashasbeen already indicated,1their animistic
notions include abelief inWater Spirits, both ofthe
seaandofrivers, and occasionally this belief finds
expression inritual observances.
Thus, forinstance, itwasformerly thecustom to
insert anumber ofsugar-palm twigs (segor kabong)into
thetopoftheship’s mast, making theendofitlook
notunlike asmall birch ofblack twigs .2
This wasintended toprevent theWater Spirit

V IMPORTANCE OFRIVERS 281
Theimportance ofrivers intheMalay Peninsula,
and forthat matter, inMalayan countries generally,
canhardly beoverrated. Itwasbytherivers that
Malay immigration, coming forthemost part, ifnot
entirely, from Sumatra, entered theinterior ofthe
Peninsula, andbefore theinflux ofEuropeans had
superseded them byroads and railways the rivers
were thesolemeans ofinland communication. All
oldMalay settlements aresituated onthebanks of
rivers orstreams, bothonthisaccount andbecause
ofthenecessity ofhaving aplentiful supply ofwater
forthepurpose ofirrigating the rice-fields, which
constitute themain source oflivelihood forthe in-
habitants.
Accordingly thebackbone, sotospeak, ofaMalay
district istheriver that runs through it,andfrom
which inmost cases the district takes itsname;for
here, aselsewhere, theriver-names aregenerally older
than thenames ofterritorial divisions. They areoften
unintelligible andprobably ofpre-Malayan origin, but
aresometimes derived from theMalay names offorest
trees. Asaruleevery reach andpoint hasaname
known tothelocal Malays, eventhough therivermay
runthrough forest andswamp with only afewvillages
scattered atintervals ofseveral miles along itsbanks.
Ofriver legends there arenotafew.The follow-
ingextract relates tooneofthelargest rivers ofthe
Peninsula, theriver Perak, which gives itsname to
thelargest andmost important oftheMalay States of
theWest Coast. Perak means silver, though none is
mined inthecountry;andthelegend isafairspecimen
ofthesortofstory which grows upround anattempt
toaccount foranotherwise inexplicable name:—
“On their return down-stream, theRaja and his

followers halted atChigar Galah, where asmall stream
runs into theriver Perak. They were struck with
astonishment atfinding thewater ofthisstream as
white assantan (thegrated pulp ofthecocoa-nut

despatched tothesource ofthestream todiscover
thecause ofthisphenomenon, found there alarge fish
ofthekind called haruan engaged insuckling her
young one. Shehadlarge white breasts fromwhich
milk issued .1

river ‘Perak’ (‘silver’), inallusion toitsexceeding

William Maxwell inPerak;theother wastaken
down bymefrom aLabu Malay inSelangor, but
Ihave notmetwith itelsewhere;aparallel version
ofthestory quoted byMaxwell being thecom-
monest form ofthelegend inSelangor aswell as
Perak.
SirWilliam Maxwell’s account runs asfollows:—

himfrom most ofthebrute creation, and classhim
with thetiger andelephant. Just asinsome parts
ofIndia sacred crocodiles areprotected and fed in
tanks setapart forthem byHindus, soinMalay
rivers hereand there particular crocodiles arecon-
sidered kramat (sacred), andaresafefrom molesta-
tion.Onariver intheinterior ofMalacca Ihave
hadmygun-barrels knocked upwhen taking aim

falling onhisknees inthebottom oftheboatand
entreating forgiveness, ontheground that the indi-
vidual reptile aimed atwas kra,7nat,and that the
speaker’s family would notbesafe ifitwere injured.
The source ofideas like this lies fardeeper inthe
Malay mind than hisMuhammadanism;but the
new creed has, inmany instances, appropriated and
accounted forthem. The connection ofthe tiger
with Ali,theuncle oftheprophet, hasalready been
explained. Agrosser Muhammadan fable hasbeen
invented regarding thecrocodile.
“This reptile, saythePerak Malays, was first
created inthefollowing manner:—
“There wasonceupon atimeawoman called Putri
Padang Gerinsing, whose petitions found great favour
andacceptance with theAlmighty.
“She itwaswhohadthecareofSitiFatima, the
daughter oftheProphet. One dayshetooksome
clayandfashioned itintothelikeness ofwhat isnow

theclaywasasheet ofupih (thesheath ofthebetel-

been eating sugar-cane, soshearranged anumber of
sugar-cane joints toserve asabackbone, and the
peelings oftherindsheutilised asribs.On itshead
sheplaced asharp stone, andshemade eyes outof
bitsofsaffron(kuniet);the tailwasmade ofthe
mid-rib andleaves ofabetel-nut frond. Sheprayed
toGodAlmighty that thecreature might have life,
and itatoncecommenced tobreathe andmove.
Foralong time itwasaplaything oftheProphet’s
daughter, SitiFatima;but itatlength became
treacherous and faithless toTuan Putri Padang
Gerinsing, whohadgrown oldand feeble. Then
Fatima cursed it,saying, 'Thou shalt bethecroco-
dileofthesea,noenjoyment shall bethine, andthou
shalt notknow lustordesire.’ Shethen deprived
itofitsteeth andtongue, anddrove nails into its
jaws toclose them. Itisthese nails wdiich serve
thecrocodile asteeth tothisday. Malay Pawangs
inPerak observe thefollowing methods ofproceeding
when itisdesired tohook acrocodile:—Tocommence
with, awhite fowlmust beslain intheorthodox way,
bycutting itsthroat, andsome ofitsblood must be
rubbed onthe line (usually formed ofrattan) to
which thefowl itself isattached asbait. Thedying
struggles ofthefowl inthewater areclosely watched,
andconclusions aredrawn fromthem astotheprob-
able behaviour ofthecrocodile when hooked. If
thefowlgoes toaconsiderable distance thecrocodile
willmost likely endeavour tomake off; but itwill
beotherwise ifthefowlmoves alittlewayonlyup
anddown oracross thestream.
