CHAPTER IV
TheMalay Pantheon
(a)Gods
Acareful investigation ofthemagic ritesandcharms
usedbyanation which haschanged itsreligion will
notunfrequently show, thatwhat isgenerally called
witchcraft ismerely theddbris oftheolder ritual, con-
demned bythepriests ofthenewer faith, butyet
stubbornly, though secretly, persisting, through the
unconquerable religious conservatism ofthemass of
thepeople.
“There isnothing thatclings longer toaracethan
the religious faith inwhich ithasbeen nurtured.
Indeed, itisimpossible foranymind that isnot
thoroughly scientific tocast offentirely thereligious
forms ofthought inwhich ithasgrown tomaturity.
Hence inevery people thathasreceived theimpression
offoreign beliefs, wefind thatthelatter donotexpel
andsupersede theolder religion, butareengrafted on
it,blent with it,oroverlie it.Observances aremore
easily abandoned than ideas, andevenwhen allthe
external forms ofthealien faithhavebeen puton,and
fewvestiges oftheindigenous oneremain, thelatter
still retains itsvitality inthemind, andpowerfully
colours orcorrupts theformer. The actual religion of


84 THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
apeople isthus ofgreat ethnographic interest, and
demands aminute andsearching observation. No
other facts relating torude tribes aremore difficult of
ascertainment, ormore often elude inquiry.”1
“The general principle stated byLogan inthe
passage justquoted receives remarkable illustration
from aclose investigation ofthefolk-lore andsuper-
stitious beliefs oftheMalays. Two successive religious
changes have taken placeamong them, andwhenwe
havesucceeded inidentifying thevestiges ofBrahman-
ismwhich underlie theexternal forms ofthe faith of
Muhammad, long established inallMalay kingdoms,
weareonlyhalf-way through ourtask.
“There yetremain thepowerful influences ofthe
stillearlier indigenous faith tobenoted andaccounted
for. Just astheBuddhists ofCeylon turn intimes of
sickness anddanger, nottotheconsolations offered by
thecreed ofBuddha, buttothepropitiation ofthe
demons feared andreverenced bytheir early pro-
genitors, andjustastheBurmese andTalaings, though
Buddhists, retain infullforce thewhole oftheNat
superstition, soamong theMalays, inspite ofcenturies
which have passed since theestablishment ofanalien
worship, theMuhammadan peasant may befound
invoking theprotection ofHindu gods against the
spirits ofevilwithwhich hisprimitive faith haspeopled
allnatural objects.”2
“What wasthefaithofMalaya seven hundred years
ago itishard tosay,butthere isacertain amount of
evidence tolead tothebelief that itwasaform of
Brahmanism, and that, nodoubt, hadsucceeded the
original spirit worship.”3

IV HINDU ANDMALAYDIVINITIES 85
The evidence offolk-lore, taken inconjunc-
tion with that supplied bycharm -books and
romances, goes toshow that thegreater gods ofthe
Malay Pantheon, though modified insome respects
byMalay ideas, were really borrowed Hindu divinities,
andthatonly thelesser godsand spirits arenative to
theMalay religious system. Itistruethatsome of
these native gods canbewithmore orlessdistinctness
identified withthegreat powers ofnature :theKing of
theWinds (Raja Angin) forinstance;“Mambang Tali
Harus,” orthegodofmid-currents (theMalay Nep-
tune);thegods ofthunder andlightning, oftheceles-
tialbodies, etc.;butnone ofthem appear tohave the
status ofthechiefgods oftheHindu system, andboth
bylandandwater theterrible Shiva (“Batara Guru”
or“Kala”) issupreme. Yeteach department of
nature, however small, has itsown particular godling
orspiritwho requires propitiation, and influences for
good orevilevery human action. Only themoral
element iswanting tothedivine hegemony—the
“cockeyed,” limping substitute which does duty for
itreflecting only tootruthfully thecharacter ofthe
people withwhom itpasses asdivine.
Iwill first take, indetail, thegods ofHindu origin.
“Batara (orBetara) Guru” is“thename bywhich
Siva isknown tohisworshippers, who constitute the
vast majority oftheBalinese, andwhoprobably con-
stituted thebulk oftheoldJavanese.”1
Inthemagic ofthePeninsular Malays wefind
Vishnu thePreserver, Brahma theCreator, Batara
Guru, Kala, and S’risimultaneously appealed tobythe
Malay magician
;andthough itwould, perhaps, berash,
1Mr.R.J.Wilkinson inJ.R.A.S.yS.B.,No.30,p.308.


86 THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
(asMr.Wilkinson says), toinfer solely fromMalay
romances orMalay theatrical invocations (many of
which owemuch toJavanese influence), thatHinduism
was themore ancient religion oftheMalays, there
isplenty ofother evidence toprove thatthe“Batara
Guru”oftheMalays (nolessthan theBatara Guru of
BaliandJava) isnone other than therecognised father
oftheHindu Trinity .1
Ofthegreater deities orgods, Batara Guru is
unquestionably thegreatest. “In theHikayat Sang
Samba (theMalay version oftheBhaumakavya),
Batara Guru appears asasupreme God, withBrahma
andVishnu assubordinate deities. ItisBatara Guru
whoalone hasthewater oflife(ayerutama(atama)

SotothisdaytheMalay magician declares that

romances oftheIndian islanders, heis

spiritwho held theplace ofAllah before theadvent
ofMuhammadanism, aspirit sopowerful thathecould
restore thedead tolife;and tohim allprayers were
addressed.”
Mr.Wilkinson, inthearticle fromwhich wehave
already quoted, deals with another point ofinterest,
theexpression sang-yang,orbatara,which ispre-
fixed toguru. After pointing outthatyang in
thiscase isnottheordinary Malay pronoun(yang,
who), butanoldword meaning a“deity,” he
remarks, thatsofarashehasbeen able todiscover,
itisonlyused ofthegreater Hindu divinities, and
notofinferior deities ordemi-gods. Thuswefind
itapplied toShiva andVishnu, butnever tothe
monkey -god Hanuman, oradeity ofsecondary
importance likeDermadewa. Such inferior divinities
have only the lesser honorific “sang ”prefixed to
their names, and inthisrespect farenobetter than
mere mortals (such asSang Sapurba andSang Ran-
junaTapa) andanimals (such as, infables, Sang
Kanchil, Mr.Mousedeer;andSang Tikus, Mr.
Rat).
“The expression batara isalso limited tothe
greater Hindu divinities (except when used asa
royal title), eg.Batara Guru, Batara Kala, Batara
Indra, Batara Bisnu, etc. Thus the expressions
sang-yang andbatara are fairly coincident intheir
application .1But there areafew deities ofwhom

thehonorific sang-yang isused, butnotbatara,e.g.
sang-yang tunggal, ‘theonlyGod,’ sang-yang sokma, etc.
“Thus batara would seem tobelimited inuseto
theactual names ofHindu deities asdistinct from
epithets describing those deities. “Batara Guru”
would seem tobeanexception—theonlyone—to
this rule,and topoint tothe fact that theoriginal
meaning ofguru hadbeen lostsight of,andthatthe
expression hadcome toberegarded only asaproper
name.”
Occasionally, as isonly tobeexpected, the
Malays getmixed intheir mythology, andofthis
Mr.Wilkinson gives twoexamples, oneoftheiden-
tification ofBatara Guru (Shiva) withBrahma (Berah-
mana), andanother ofthedrawing ofadistinction
between “Guru” (Shiva) and “Mahadewa,” which
latter isonlyanother name forthesame divinity.
Such slips areinevitable among anilliterate people,
andshould always becriticised bycomparison with
the original Hindu tenets, from which these ideas
maybepresumed tohave proceeded.
taken ascorrect. And inany case
itsuse incombination withguru
appears towarrant itsclassification
with the titles applied tothegreater
deities. It isalso, however, used,
like sang,ofinferior deities and
even ofanimals {e.g. ina“Spectre
Huntsman” charm) wefind“Lansat,
sa-raja anjing,etc.” Dewa isused
indiscriminately (occasionally incon-
junction withmambang)both ofthe
greater and lesser divinities. Thuswe
notunfrequently findsuch expressions
asDewa Bisnu {i.e. Vishnu), dewa
mambang,dewa danmambang,etc.;
andweareexpressly told that they
(theDewas) “are socalled because
they areimmortal.” Mambang (per se)
issaid tobesimilarly used, notonly of
greater {videApp. xvii.), butoflesser
divinities, and“Mambang TaliHams,”god ofmid-currents, haseven been
explained asreferring toBatara Guru
(Shiva). This, however, isnodoubt
aninstance ofconfusion, asitgenerally
appears tobeusedwith the“colour”
attributes (e.g.M.puteh,White;M.
hitam,Black;M.kuning,Yellow)
usually assigned totheinferior divini-
ties;and,moreover, inaninvocation
addressed tothesea-spirit, the‘
‘godof

amessage toDato’ Rimpun ‘Alam,
which appears tobemerely another
name forBatara Guru, thereason given
forthepreferment ofthisrequest being
thatheisinthehabit of“visiting the
Heart oftheSeas” inwhich ’Toh
Rimpun ‘Alam dwells (the titleofthe
latter being perhaps taken from the
tree,Pauh Janggi),


IV ICALAAND S’Rl 89
Mr.Wilkinson quotes anextraordinary genealogy
representing, inter alia,“Guru astheactual father
oftheHindu Trinity,” andalsoof“Sambu” (whom
hecannot identify), and “Seri, who istheHindu
Sri, thegoddess ofgrain, and, therefore, adeity
ofimmense importance totheoldJavanese and
Malays.”
On this Iwould onlyremark thatSambu (or
Jambu) isthe first portion ofthename almost uni-
versally ascribed totheCrocodile-spirit bythePen-
insular Malays .1
Itwould bebeyond thescope ofthiswork to
attempt theidentification ofBatara Guru (Shiva) with
allthenumerous manifestations and titles attributed
tohimbytheMalays, butthespecial manifestation
(ofShiva), which iscalled “Kala,” forms anintegral
part ofthegeneral conception, whether among the
1Footnote supra. Sambu (Sambhu,
theAuspicious One) ismerely another
name forShiva (rarely ofBrahma),
and itsapplication tothecrocodile-
spiritwould appear toindicate that this
latter was, formerly, atleast, regarded
asanembodiment ofthat supreme
god’s manifestation asawater -god.
Itisworth while tocompare thiswith
theexpression “’Toh Panjang Kuku,”
which isapplied tothecorresponding
manifestation ofthesupreme godon
land, andwhich strongly suggests the
tiger.
“Most ofthetheological words ofthis
list[printed inApp. xiv.] areSans-
krit,andafford proof sufficient, ifany
were needed, oftheformer prevalence
oftheHindu religion among theMalays
and Javanese. Many ofthem are
more orlesscorrupted inorthography,
owing tothedefective pronunciation
and defective alphabets oftheArchi-
pelago. Some, also, arealtered or
varied insense. Tapas,‘ascetic de-
votion,’ isdeprived ofitslastconson-antandbecomes tapa. Avatar,‘a
descent,’ isconverted into batara;
andinstead ofimplying thedescent or
incarnation ofadeity, isused asan
appellative forany oftheprincipal
Hindu deities. Combined withguru,

perhaps, literally “the god ofthe

mins.Agama inSanskrit is“authority

Javanese itisreligion itself, and isat
present applied both totheMahome-
danandtheChristian religions. With
nearly thesame orthography, and in
thesame sense, Sanskrit words, asfar

Malays orHindus, and is,therefore, deserving of
some attention.
TheMalay conception ofBatara Guru seems to
have been thathehadboth agood andabadside
tohischaracter. Though hewas“Destroyer” he
was also “Restorer-to-life ,”1and itwould appear
that these twoopposite manifestations ofhispower
tended todevelop intotwo distinct personalities,
adevelopment which apparently wasnever entirely
consummated. This, however, isnot the only
difficulty, foroninvestigating the limits ofthe
respective spheres ofinfluence ofBatara Guru and
Kala, wefind that theonly sphere, which isalways
admitted tobeunder Kala’s influence, istheinter-
mediate zonebetween therespective spheres ofinflu-
ence ofBatara Guru (ashe iscalled ifonland, “Si
Raya”ifatsea)andathird divinity, whogoesby
thename of“’Toh Panjang Kuku,” or“Grandsire
Long-Claws.”
NowHindu mythology, weare told,knows next
tonothing ofthesea,andanysuch attempt asthis
todefine therespective boundaries ofseaandland
isalmost certain tobedue totheinfluence ofMalay
ideas. Again, theintermediate zone isnotneces-
sarily considered lessdangerous than thatofdefinitely
evil influences. Thus themost dangerous time for
children tobeabroad issunset, thehourwhenwe
can “call itneither perfect daynornight”; so
tooadayofmingled rainandsunshine isregarded
asfraught with peculiar dangers from evil spirits, and
itwould bequite inkeeping withsuch ideas thatthe
intermediate zone, whether between high andlow
water-mark, orbetween theclearing andprimeval

Inwhich case theexpression “Grandsire Long-
Claws” might beused tosignify this special mani-
festation ofShiva onland, possibly through the
personality oftheTiger, just astheCrocodile -spirit
appears torepresent Shiva bywater .1
Wethusreach apoint ofexceptional interest, for
hunting, being among theoldHindus oneofthe
seven deadly sins,wasregarded asalowpursuit, and
onewhich would never beindulged inbyagod. Yet
Iwasrepeatedly toldwhen collecting charms about
theSpectre Huntsman thathewas agod, and, ex-
plicitly, thathewasBatara Guru. This shows the
strength oftheMalay influences which hadbeen at
work, andwhich had actually succeeded incorrupting
thecharacter, sotospeak, ofthesupreme godofthis
borrowed Hindu Trinity .2
The Batara Guru ofthe Sea,who bysome
magicians, atallevents, isidentified with SiRaya
(the“Great One”), and,probably wrongly, with the
God ofMid-currents3(Mambang Tali Harus), isofa
much milder character than histerrestrial namesake or
compeer, andalthough sickness maysometimes be

exact relation that’TohMambang Tali

Batara Guru diLaut. Most probably,
however, theGod ofMid-currents,
whose powers arelessextensive than
those ofthe“Shiva oftheSea,” isan
oldsea-deity, native totheMalay (pre-
Hindu) religion, and that“Shiva of

(b)Spirits,Demons,andGhosts
The“Jins” or“Genii,” generally speaking, form
avery extensive class ofquite subordinate divinities,
godlings, orspirits, whose place inMalay mythology
isclearly due,whether directly orindirectly, toMuham-
madan influences, butwhomaybemost conveniently
treated here asaffording asort ofconnecting link
between godsandghosts. There has, itwould appear,
been astrong tendency onthepart oftheMalays to
identify these imported spirits with thespirits oftheir
older (Hindu) religion, buttheonlyGenie who really

oftheEarth, andwhose bride, SangGadin (orGading),
presented himwithseven strapping Black Genii as

Altogether there areonehundred andninety of
these (Black?) Genii—more strictly, perhaps, onehun-
dredandninety-three, which coincides curiously with
thenumber of“Mischiefs” (Badi), which reside in
“all living things.” The resemblance, Imay add,
does notendhere;forthough theGeniimaydogood,
andthe“Badi” donot,both areconsidered able to
doinfinite harm tomortals, andbothmake choice of
thesame kind ofdwelling-places, such ashollows in

Ujan,” which may possibly bePersia);1other
magicians, however, variously derive them from the
dissolution ofvarious parts oftheanatomy ofthegreat
snake “Sakatimuna,” ofthe“First Great Failure”

thedrops ofblood which spirted uptoheaven when
the first twins, Abel andCain (intheMalay version

Thetheory already mentioned, viz.that theBlack
King oftheGenii gradually came tobeidentified with
Kala, andlatercame gradually tobeestablished asa
separate personality, appears tobetheonlyonewhich
will satisfactorily explain therelations subsisting be-
tween theBlack andWhite Genii, whoareontheone
hand distinctly declared tobebrothers, whilst the
White Genie isinanother passage declared tobe
Maharaja Dewa orMahadewa, which latter is,aswe
have already seen, aspecial name ofShiva.
ThisWhite Genie issaid tohave sprung, byone
account, from theblood-drops which fellontheground

others, aparticular class ofthemwho

(printed intheSelangor Journal,vol. i.

native ofJavawhohadspent several
years intheMalay Peninsula, and as
Mecca isthegoal ofthepilgrimage to
allgoodMuhammadans alike, itis
important toknow something ofthe
ideaswhich arethere disseminated, and
withwhich theMalay pilgrim would
belikely tocome incontact. “In
theunseen world theplace offirst
importance must beaccorded, on
account oftheirimmense numbers, to
the‘Jins’ (the‘Genii’ oftheArabian

“TheJavanese, drawing aslightly
stronger line ofdistinction (than that
ofgoodandbad genii intheArabian

Besides these subdivisions, certain Genii aresome-
times specifically connected with special objects or
ideas. Thus there aretheGenii oftheroyal musical
instruments (Jin Nemfiri, orLempiri, Gendang, and
Naubat), whoaresometimes identified with theGenii
oftheState (Jin Karaja’an), and theGenii ofthe
Royal Weapons (JinSembuana), both ofwhich classes
ofGenii areheld able tostrikemen dead. The only
other Genie that Iwould here specially mention is
theJin ‘Afrit (sometimes called Jin Rafrit), from
whom the“White Man ”(adesignation which is
often specially used inthePeninsula asasynonym
forEnglishman) issometimes said tohave sprung, but
who belongs inArabian mythology toahigher class
than themere Genii. Before leaving thesubject of
Genii, Imust, however, point out theextremely
common juxtaposition oftheArabic word “Jin” and
theMalay “Jembalang.” From thefrequency with
which thisjuxtaposition occurs, andfrom the factthat
thetwoappear tobeused largely asconvertible terms,
wemight expect tofindthat JinandJembalang were
mere synonyms, both applicable tosimilar classes of
spirits. Theprocess isnotquite complete, however, as
although theexpression Jembalang Tunggal (theonly
Jembalang), isfound aswellasJinTunggal, thehigher
thegood Genii, theycannot diebefore
thegreat dayofjudgment, but(unlike
them) they aredumb.
*iGreat astheirnumbers aretheyare

honorific Sang Raja orSa-Raja isnever, sofarasIam
aware, prefixed totheword “Jembalang,” though itis
frequently prefixed to“Jin.” Oftheother members
oftheMalay hierarchy whoowe their introduction to
Muhammadan influences, theonlyones ofimportance
areangels (Mala’ikat), prophets (Nabi), andheadmen
(Sheikh).
Iwilltakethem inthisorder.
Oftheangels, unquestionably themost important
areAzrael (‘Azra’il or‘Ijrail), Michael (Mika’il), Israfel
(Israfil, Ijrafil, orSerafil), and Gabriel (Jibra’il or
’Jabra’il, often corrupted intoRaja Brahil). There
canbenodoubt that theforegoing aremeant for
thenames ofagroup offour archangels, thename
ofIsrafel corresponding toAbdiel, who generally
occupies thefourth place inourown angelic hierarchy.
Their customary duties areapportioned among the
fourgreat angels asfollows:—
Azrael is,aswith us,theangel ofdeath, who
“carries offthelives ofallcreatures”;Israfel is“lord
ofallthedifferent airs”inourbody;Michael isthe
“giver ofdaily bread ”
;andGabriel isamessenger
or“bringer ofnews.”
Sometimes, again, aWhite Angel (Mala’ikat Puteh)
ismentioned, egasbeing in“charge ofallthings
inthejungle,” butwhat his specific duties are in
thisconnection does nottranspire.
Inaninvocation addressed tothe Sea-spirit, how-
ever,wefindfourmore such angels mentioned, allof
whom hold similar charges:—
Chitar Ali istheangel’s name, who islordofthewhirlpool;
Sabur Ali istheangel’s name, who islordofthewinds;
SirAli istheangel's name, who islordofthewaters ofthesea;
Putar Ali istheangel’s name, who islordoftherainbow.


IV ANGELS ANDPROPHETS 99
Nodoubt thenames ofmany more ofthesub-
ordinate angels might becollected, aswearerepeatedly
toldthatthey areforty-four innumber.
Oftheprophets (Nabi) there areanindefinite
number, the titlebeing applied tomany ofthemore
prominent characters who figure inourownOld
Testament (aswell asintheKoran), butwhowould
notbyourselves beconsidered topossess anyspecial
qualifications forprophetic office. Among themore
famous ofthese Imaymention (afterMuhammad and
hisimmediate compeers) theprophet Solomon (some-
times considered—nodoubt owing tohisunrivalled
reputation formagical skill—astheking oftheGenii,
whose assistance thehunter ortrapper iscontinu-
allyinvoking)
;theprophet David, celebrated for
thebeauty ofhisvoice; andtheprophet Joseph,
celebrated forthebeauty ofhiscountenance. Besides
these (and others ofthesame type), there isagroup
ofminor prophets whose assistance iscontinually in-
voked incharms;these aretheprophet Tap(Tetap
orKetap?), “lord oftheearth;” theprophet Khailir
(Khaithir orKhizr), “lord ofwater;” theprophet
Noah, “lordoftrees;”andtheprophet Elias, “planter
oftrees.”
Khizr isoften confounded with Elias. He dis-
covered anddrank ofthefountain oflife(whence his
connection with water), and willconsequently notdie
tillthelasttrump.
Next totheprophets comes the“Sultan” (Sultan),
or“King” (Malik), both ofwhich Arabic titles,
however, aresomewhat rarely used byMalay
magicians. Stillwefindsuch expressions asSa-
Raja (Sang- Raja?) Malik (King ofKings) applied to
Batara Guru.


IOO THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
Next tothese royal honorifics comes the titleof
“Headman”or“Sheikh.”
There are, itisusually stated, fourofthese Sheikhs
who are“penned”(di-kandang)intheFour Corners
oftheEarth respectively, andwhose names are‘Abdul
Kadir, ‘Abdul Muri, athirdwhose name isnotmen-
tioned, and‘Abdul ‘Ali.1
Sometimes they arecalled “Sheikh ‘Alam ”(orSi
Putar ‘Alam), andareeach said toreside “within aring-
fence ofwhite iron.” Hence weobtain aperfectly
intelligible meaning fortheexpression, “Askpardon of
theFour Corners oftheWorld” i.e.oftheSheikhs
who reside therein, though thephrase sounds ridi-
culous enough without such explanation.
Theonlyother Arabic titlewhich isperhaps worth
noticing here2isthatof“Priest ”(Imam), which we
findsomewhat curiously used inaninvocation addressed
tothesea-spirit. “ImamAnJalii isthename ofthe
‘Priest oftheSeal”
Intheinvocation addressed totheSea-spirit we
findtheexpression:—
“Jungle-chief oftheWorld isthename oftheOld
Man oftheSea.”
There can,however, belittledoubt that this“Old
Man oftheSea” isameresynonym forBatara Guru.
Asetofexpressions towhich special reference
should perhaps bemade consists ofthe titles used
bythewild jungle tribes (Sakais), theuseofwhich

TheHantu Rimba (Deep-forest Demon), Hantu
Raya1(“Great” Demon), Hantu Denei (Demon of
Wild-beast-tracks), theHantu-hantuan (Echo-spirits),
and Ithink theHantu Bakal, are allspirits ofthe
jungle, butareperhaps somewhat less localised than
thelarge class ofspirits (such astheMalacca-cane,
gharu

specially associated with particular trees.

B’rok being what isgenerally called the “cocoa-nut

them, whilst unconscious, toperform wonderful climb-
