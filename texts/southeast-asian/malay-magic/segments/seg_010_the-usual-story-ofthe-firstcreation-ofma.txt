The usual story ofthe firstcreation ofman,how-
ever, appears tobeaMalay modification ofArabic
beliefs.
Thuswearetold thatmanwascreated from the
fourelements—earth, air,water, and fire—inaway
which thefollowing extract, .taken from aSelangor
charm-book, willexplain:—
“GodAlmighty spake unto Gabriel, saying,
‘Benotdisobedient, OGabriel,
ButgoandgetmetheHeart oftheEarth .5
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.
‘Iwillnotgive it,5saidtheEarth.
Then went theProphet Israfel toget it,
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.

Then went Michael toget it,
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.
Then went Azrael toget it,
And atlasthegottheHeart oftheEarth.
When hegottheHeart oftheEarth
Theempyrean andcrystalline spheres shook,
Andthewhole Universe (shook).
When hegottheHeart oftheEarth he1made from ittheImage of
Adam.
ButtheHeart oftheEarth wasthen toohard;
Hemixed Water with it,and itbecame too soft,
(So)hemixed Firewith it,and atlaststruck outtheimage ofAdam.
Then heraised uptheimage ofAdam,
Andcraved Life for itfromAlmighty God,
AndGodAlmighty gave itLife.
Then sneezed GodAlmighty, andtheimage ofAdam brake inpieces,
Andhe(Azrael) returned toremake theimage ofAdam.
ThenGodAlmighty commanded totake steel ofKhorassan,
And drive itdown hisback, sothat itbecame thethirty-three bones.
Theharder steel atthetop,thesofter below it.
Theharder steel shotupskywards,
And thesofter steel penetrated earthwards.
Thus theimage ofAdam had life,anddwelt inParadise.
(There) Adam beheld (two?)peacocks ofnoordinary beauty,
And theAngel Gabriel appeared.
4Verily,OAngel Gabriel, Iamsolitary,
Easier isittoliveinpairs, Icrave awife.’
GodAlmighty spake, saying,‘Command Adam
Topray atdawn aprayer oftwogenuflexions.’
ThenAdam prayed, andourLadyEvedescended,
Andwascaptured bytheProphet Adam;
Butbefore hehadfinished hisprayer shewastaken back,
Therefore Adam prayed theprayer oftwogenuflexions asdesired,
And atthelastobtained ourLady Eve.
When theyweremarried (Eve) bore twins every time,
Until shehadborne forty-four children,
And thechildren, too,were wedded, handsome withhandsome, and
plain with plain.”
The magician who dictated theabove account
stated thatwhen Azrael stretched forth hishand to
take theHeart oftheEarth, theEarth-spirit caught
hold ofhismiddle finger, which yielded tothestrain,
andthusbecame longer than therest,andreceived its
Malay name ofthe“Devils Finger” (jari kantu).
1ItisGabriel whoperforms this office intheaccount which follows.


II ANOTHER ACCOUNT 21
Aparallel account adds thattheHeart oftheEarth
waswhite, andgives afuller description oftheinter-
viewbetween Azrael andhisformidable antagonist, the
Earth. After saluting the latter intheorthodox
Muhammadan fashion, Azrael explains hismission,
and ismetbyapoint-blank refusal. “Iwillnot
give it,”said theEarth (referring toitsHeart),
“forasmuch as Iwassocreated byGodAlmighty,
and ifyoutakeawaymyHeart Ishall assuredly die.”
Atthisbrusque, though perhaps natural retort, the
archangel loses histemper, andrudely exclaims that
he“will take theEarth’s Heart whether itwill
orno.” Here Azrael “gave theEarth apush with
hisrighthand andhis left,andgrasping attheHeart
oftheEarth, gothold ofitandcarried itback tothe
presence ofGod.” Godnowsummons Gabriel and
orders him tomould (lit.forge) theimage ofAdam.
Then Gabriel took thelump ofearth which wasthe
Earth’s Heart andmixed itfirstwith water tosoften
it,then, asitwastoo soft,with fire toharden it,and
when theimage wasmade, obtained lifefromGod to
put into it.1[The breaking ofthe firstimage which
1 ‘‘Concerning thecreation ofAdam,
here intimated, theMohammedans have
several peculiar traditions. They say
theangels Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil
were sentbyGod,oneafter another, to
fetch forthatpurpose seven handfuls
ofearth from different depths, andof
different colours (whence some account
forthevarious complexions ofmankind);
buttheEarth being apprehensive ofthe
consequence, and desiring them to
represent her fear toGod that the
creature Hedesigned toform would
rebel against Him,anddrawdown His
curse upon her,theyreturned without

wasmade, andthemaking ofthesecond, arehere
omitted]. Finally, thecreation of“ourLady” Eveand
thebirth ofher first-born aredescribed, the latter
occasion being accompanied byathick darkness, which
compelled Adam totake offhisturban andbeat the
child therewith inorder todispel the evilinfluences
(badi)which hadattended itsbirth.1
Thefollowing extract (from aMalay treatise quoted
byNewbold) fairly describes thegeneral state ofMalay
ideas respecting theconstitution ofthehuman body :—
“Plato, Socrates,. Galen, Aristotle, andother philo-
sophers affirm thatGod created manofafixednumber
ofbones, blood-vessels, etc.Forinstance, theskull is
composed of5Jbones, theplace ofsmellandsense of7
bones, between thisandtheneck are32bones. The
neck iscomposed of7bones, andtheback of24bones;
208bones arecontained intheothermembers ofthe
body. Inallthere are360bones and360blood-vessels
inaman’s body. The brains weigh 306miscals,the
blood 573. The total ofallthebones, blood-vessels,
large and small, and gristles, amounts to1093 iand
thehairs ofthehead tosixlacsand4000. Theframe
ofman isdivided into40great parts, which areagain
superior, took asecret resolution never
toacknowledge him assuch. After
thisGod animated thefigure ofclay
andendued itwithanintelligent soul,
andwhenHehadplaced him inpara-
dise,formed Eveoutofhisleftside.”—
Sale’s Kor&n, ch. ii.(oftranslation),
p.4(note).
1“TheCreator determined tomake
man, and forthatpurpose Hetook
some clayfrom theearthandfashioned
itintothefigure ofaman. ThenHe
took theSpirit ofLife toendue this
body with vitality, andplaced thespirit
onthehead ofthe figure. Butthe
spiritwasstrong, andthebody, being
only clay, could nothold it,andwasreft inpieces and scattered into the
air. Those fragments ofthe firstgreat
Failure arethespirits ofearth andsea
and air.
“The Creator thenformed another
clay figure, but into thisoneHe
wrought some iron, sothatwhen it
received the vital spark itwithstood
thestrain andbecame Man. That
manwasAdam, andtheiron that isin
theconstitution ofhisdescendants has
stood them ingood stead. When they
lose ittheybecome of little more
account than their prototype the first
failure.”—Swettenham, Malay Sketches,
p.199.

viz. air, fire, earth, andwater. With these elements
areconnected four essences—thesoul orspirit with
air,lovewith fire,concupiscence with earth, andwisdom
with water.”1
(b)Sanctity oftheBody
Indealing with thisbranch ofthesubject Iwill
firsttake thecaseofthekings and priestly magicians
who present themost clearly- marked examples of
personal sanctity which arenow tobefound among
Malays, and willthen describe thechief features of
thesanctity ascribed toallranks alike inrespect of
certain special parts oftheordinary human anatomy.
The theory oftheking astheDivine Man isheld
perhaps asstrongly intheMalay region asinany
other part oftheworld, afactwhich isstrikingly
emphasised bythealleged right ofMalay monarchs
“toslay atpleasure,without being guilty ofa
crime." Not only istheking’s person considered
sacred, butthesanctity ofhisbody isbelieved to
communicate itself tohisregalia, and toslaythose
whobreak theroyal taboos. Thus itisfirmly be-
lieved thatanyonewho seriously offends theroyal
person, who touches (even foramoment) orwho
imitates (even with theking’s permission) thechief
objects oftheregalia,2orwhowrongfully makes use

ofanyoftheinsignia orprivileges ofroyalty, will
bekena daulat,i.e.struck dead, byaquasi -electric
discharge ofthatDivine Power which theMalays
suppose toreside intheking’s person,1andwhich
iscalled “Daulat”or“Royal Sanctity.” Before I
proceed, however, todiscuss thispower, itwillbebest
togivesome description oftheregalia inwhich it
resides:—
OfMalacca Newbold says :“The articles ofMalay
regalia usually consist ofasilasila,orbook ofgenealo-
gical descent, acode oflaws, avest orbaju,anda
fewweapons, generally akrisykleywang, orspear.”2
“The limbing isasort oflance;thetombak
bandrang aspear ofstate, fourorseven ofwhich are
usually carried before thechiefs intheinterior ofthe
Peninsula. The handle iscovered with asubstance
flowing from itlike ahorse -tail,dyed crimson,
sometimes crimson andwhite;this isgenerally of
hair.”3
SoinLeyden’s translation oftheMalay Annals
(1821) weread—
“Myname isBichitram Shah, whoam raja.
. . .This isthesword, Chora samendang kian
(i.e.mandakini\ and that isthelance, Limbuar (i.e.
limbuara);this isthesignet, Cayu Gampit, which is
employed incorrespondence with rajas.”4
“TheChora samedang kian (i.e.mandakini)isthe

“Daulat” iftheywere toimitate
them tooaccurately. InPerak the
custom would appear tobe less
strict. Thus from Malay Sketches
(p.215)wemay gather that inthe
“silver” state even themost sacred
pieces oftheregalia accompany the
royal party upon their annual expedi-
tion toseek forturtles’ eggs.1“Thekabesaran orregalia ofevery
petty state issupposed tobeendowed

II CHARACTERISTICS OFROYALTY 29
Buttheextraordinary strength oftheMalay belief
inthesupernatural powers oftheregalia oftheir
sovereigns canonly bethoroughly realised after a
study oftheir romances, inwhich their kings are
credited with alltheattributes ofinferior gods, whose
birth, asindeed every subsequent actoftheir after life,
isattended bythemostamazing prodigies.
They areusually invulnerable, and are gifted
with miraculous powers, such asthat oftransforming
themselves, andofreturning to(orrecalling others
to) life;infactthey have, inevery way, lessofthe
man about them andmore ofthegod. Thus it
isthat thefollowing description ofthedress of
anold-time Raja falls easily into line with what
would otherwise appear theobjectless jargon which
stillconstitutes thepreamble ofmany aMalay prince’s
letters, butwhich canyetbehardly regarded asmere
rhetoric, since ithasadeepmeaning forthosewho
read it:—
“He wore the trousers called beraduwanggi,
miraculously made without letting inpieces;hundreds
ofmirrors encircled hiswaist, thousands encircled his
bythePower ofGodAlmighty andthe
virtue ofadescendant ofRajaSecander
Zulkarneini, thewater within these
circles became fresh, and allthecrews
supplied themselves with it,andunto
thisdaythefresh water ismixed with
thesaltatthisplace.” (3)Thehorse,
which isusually called “Sembrani,”
isamagic steed, “which could fly
through theairaswell asswim through
thewater” (Leyd., Mai. Ann. p.
17). (4)Forthemountains Goon-
tang-goontang (orSaguntang Maha-

atpleasure without being guilty ofa
crime”isaprivilege which stillbelongs
toMalay sovereigns ofthe firstrank.
Similar sacred objects, belonging toanother Sultan of“Menangcabow”
named “Gaggar Allum”(Gegar ‘Alam),
“were asacred crown fromGod”; “the
cloth sansistah kallah,which weaves

many others worthy ofthe Sultan

“At funerals, whether thedeceased hasbeen a

Similar prohibitions are still inforce atthecourts

II LINGUISTIC TABOOS35
ashavebeen mentioned, SirW.E.Maxwell mentions
three royal perquisites(larangan raja), i.e.river turtles
(tuntong)(bywhich henodoubt means their eggs);
elephants (bywhich hedoubtless means elephants’
tusks);1andthe fruitofthe“ketiarj
fromwhich oil
ismade bythePerak Malays. Headds, “Itused to

Besides theabove there arenotafew linguistic

deceased,” with theaddition ofanexpression
alluding tosome prominent fact inhis life,oroccasion-
allytotheplace ofhisdecease. These titles, strange
asitmayseem, areoften thereverse ofcomplimentary,
andoccasionally ridiculous .1
Itmust notbeforgotten, too, indiscussing the
divine attributes oftheMalay king, thatheisfirmly
believed topossess apersonal influence overtheworks
ofnature, such asthegrowth ofthecrops andthe
bearing offruit-trees. Thissame property issupposed
toreside inalesser degree inhisdelegates, andeven
inthepersons ofEuropeans incharge ofdistricts.
Thus Ihave frequently known (inSelangor) thesuc-
cessorfailure ofthericecrops attributed toachange
ofdistrict officers, and inonecase Ieven heard an
outbreak offerocity which occurred among man-eating
crocodiles laid atthedoor ofamost zealous andable,
though perhaps occasionally somewhat unsympathetic,

p.218,where thesame listoflinguistic
taboos appears tobeused inPerak.

custom ofMalays todiscontinue after
thedeath ofaking theuseofthe title

title isinvented forthe deceased
monarch, bywhich he isever after-

similar custom among other Indo-
Chinese races hasbeen noticed by
Colonel Yule :‘‘There isalsoacustom
ofdropping orconcealing theproper
name oftheking. This exists in
Burma and(according toLaLoubere) inSiam. The various kings ofthose
countries aregenerally distinguished by
some nickname derived from facts in
their reign orpersonal relations, and
applied tothem after their decease.
Thus wehearamong theBurmese
kings of‘theking dethroned by
foreigners,’ ‘the kingwho fledfrom
theChinese,’ ‘the grandfather king,’
andeven ‘the king thrown into the
water.’ Now thishasaclose parallel

II SALUTATION 37
occasion when three deaths occurred during aDistrict
Officers temporary absence, themere fact ofhis
absence wasconsidered significant. Imayadd that
royal blood issupposed bymany Malays tobewhite,
and this isthepivot onwhich theplotofnotafew
Malay folk-tales ismade toturn .1
Finally, itmust bepointed outthat thegreatest
possible importance isattached tothemethod ofsalut-
ingtheking.
Inthe“SriRama” (theMalay Ramayana) we
read,even ofthechiefs,that—
“While yetsomeway offtheybowed tothedust,
When they gotneartheymade obeisance,
Uplifting ateach step their fingers ten,
Thehands closed together liketherootlets ofthebakong palm2
The fingers oneontheother likeapileofsirih2leaves.”8
Equals inrankwhen saluting oneanother touch4
(though theydonotshake) each other’s hands, but
aperson ofhumble birth must nottouch hands
insaluting agreat chief. “Aman,named Imam
Bakar, wasonce slain atPasirTambang, atthemouth
oftheTembeling river. Heincautiously touched
hands ingreeting with aChief called To’Gajah, and
the latter, seizing him inaniron grip, heldhim fast,
while hewasstabbed todeath with spears.”5
Insaluting agreat Chief, liketheDato’ Maharaja

notsuffered toascend beyond thebase ofthechin.
Insaluting areal Raja, thehands arecarried
higher and higher, according tothe prince’s rank,
until, fortheSultan, thetipsofthethumbs areon
alevel with theforehead. Little details such as
these areofimmense importance intheeyes ofthe
Malays, andnotwithout reason, seeing that inan
Independent Native Statemany amanhascomebyhis
death forcarelessness intheirobservance.”1
Intheking’s audience hall theformal saluta-
tions areperformed inasitting posture, and in
this case, too, thegreatest attention ispaid tothe
height towhich thehands areraised. Thechief twice
makes salutation inasitting posture asheadvances,
and atthethird advance bends over the Sultan’s
hands, twomore salutations being made onhisway
back tohisplace.
Aflagrant infringement ofanyoftheprerogatives
oftheSultan, such asthose Ihave described, iscertain,
itisthought, toprove fatal,more orlessimmediately.
Thus thedeath ofPenghulu Mohit, awell-known
Malay headman oftheKlang district, inSelangor, which
took place while Iwas incharge ofthat district, was
atthetime very generally attributed bythe local
Malays tohisusurpation ofcertain royal privileges
orprerogatives ontheoccasion ofhisdaughter’s
wedding. One ofthese was hisacceptance ofgift-

buffaloes, decorated after theroyal fashion, which were
presented tohim aswedding gifts inhisdaughter’s
honour. These buffaloes hadacovering ofcloth put
overthem, their horns covered, andacrescent-shaped
breast -ornament(dokoh)hung about their necks.
Thus dressed theywere taken toMohit’s house in
solemn procession.1Itwas, atthetime, considered
significant that thevery first ofthese gift-buffaloes,
which hadbeen brought overland from Jugra, where
theSultan lived, haddiedonarrival, andwhatever
thecausemayhave been, itisafact thatMohit’s
mother died adayortwo after theconclusion ofthe
wedding ceremonies, and thatMohit himself was
taken illalmost immediately anddied only about a
fortnight later.
The only person who, informer days, wasnot
intheleast affected bytheroyal taboos which pro-
tected theregalia from thecommon touch wasthe
(now Ibelieve extinct) official who held thepost of
Court Physician (Maharaja Lela). He,andhealone,
might gofreely intheroyal apartments wherever he
chose, andtheimmunity andfreedom which heen-
joyed inthisrespect passed intoaproverb, theex-
pression “toacttheCourt Physician ”(buatMaharaja
Lela) being used todescribe analtogether unwarrant-
able familiarity orimpertinence.
Thefollowing story (though Itell itagainst myself)
isperhaps thebest illustration Icangive ofthegreat
danger supposed tobeincurred bythosewhomeddle
with theparaphernalia ofroyalty. Among the late
Sultan’s insignia ofroyalty (in1897) were acouple of

ofinfinite annoyance andanxiety totheinmates on
account oftheir veryuncanny behaviour !
Drops ofperspiration, forinstance, would formupon
theTrumpet when aleading member oftheRoyal
House wasabout todie(this actually happened, asI
was told, atLangat justbefore thedeath ofTungku

during myresidence intheneighbourhood). Then
oneRaja Bakar, sonofaRaja ‘Ali,during the re-
thatching ofthehouse atBandar, accidentally trod
upon thewooden barrel ofoneoftheStateDrums—
anddied inconsequence ofhisinadvertence .When,
therefore, ahornet’s nestformed inside oneofthese

willingness which waspresently justified, astheChina-
man, too, after afewdays’ interval, swelled upand
died. Both these strange coincidences were readily
confirmed bythepresent Sultan onanoccasion
when Ihappened toquestion theauthenticity ofthe
story, and asHisHighness isoneofthemost en-
lightened andtruthful ofmen, such confirmation cannot
easily besetaside. Butthestrangest coincidence of

tovisittheRajaMuda athishouse atBandar, Itook
theopportunity ofasking whether there wasany

andasHisHighness notonlyvery obligingly assented,

theextent towhich certain portions ofthehuman frame
havecome tobeinvested with sanctity, andtorequire to
betreated with special ceremonies. These parts ofthe
anatomy are, inparticular, thehead, thehair, theteeth,
theears,andthenails, allofwhich Iwilltake intheir
order.
Thehead, inthe firstplace, isundoubtedly stillcon-
sidered bytheMalays topossess some modified degree
ofsanctity. Aproof ofthis isthecustom i^adat) which
regulates theextent ofthesacrifice tobeoffered ina
case ofassault orbattery bytheparty committing
theinjury. Ifanypartofthehead isinjured, nothing
lessthanagoat willsuffice (theanimal being killed and

thebody, theslaughter ofacock (tobedisposed ofin
asimilar way) willbeheld tobesufficient reparation,
andsoon,thesacrifice becoming oflessvalue inpro-
portion astheinjured part isfarther from thehead.
So, too,Mr.Frazer writes: “The . . .superstition
(ofthesanctity ofthehead) existsamong theMalays;
foranearly traveller reports that inJavapeople‘wear
nothing ontheir heads, andsaythatnothing mustbeon
their heads, . . .and ifanyperson were toputhis

donotbuild houses with stories inorder thatthey

Thus Iwastoldthat informer daysMalay menusually
wore their hairlong,and Imyself haveseenaninstance
ofthis atJugra inSelangor intheperson ofaMalay2
oftheoldschool, whowaslocally famous onthisaccount.
So, too,during the forty days which must elapse
before thepurification ofawoman after thebirth of

andsomaintained until theboybegins togrow up,
butfrequently theoperation ispostponed (generally,
itissaid, inconsequence ofavowmade bythechild’s
parents) until theperiod ofpuberty ormarriage. Great

II THESOULOFMAN 47
(c)TheSoul
The Malay conception oftheHuman Soul
(Semangat)1isthat ofaspecies of“Thumbling,” “a
thin, unsubstantial human image,” ormannikin, which
istemporarily absent from thebody insleep, trance,
disease, andpermanently absent after death.
This mannikin, which isusually invisible but is
supposed tobeabout asbigasthethumb, corresponds
exactly inshape, proportion, andeven incomplexion, to
itsembodiment orcasing (sarong), z.e.thebody inwhich
ithas itsresidence. Itisofa“vapoury, shadowy, or
filmy” essence, though notsoimpalpable butthat itmay
cause displacement onentering aphysical object, and
asitcan“fly”or“flash ”quickly from place toplace,
itisoften, perhaps metaphorically, addressed asifit
were abird .2
Thus inacharm given intheAppendix wefind—
“Hither, Soul,come hither !
Hither, Little One,come hither!
Hither, Bird,come hither!
Hither, Filmy One,come hither!”3
Asthismannikin istheexact reproduction inevery
wayofitsbodily counterpart, and is“the cause oflife
andthought intheindividual itanimates,” itmayreadily
beendowed withquasi-human feelings, and“independ-
ently possess thepersonal consciousness andvolition of
1OrSuniangat. The derivation of
theword isunknown:possibly itmay
beconnected withsangat
,“excessive,”
orbangat,“sudden, quick.” The
meaning covers both“soul” and“life”
(i.e .notthestate ofbeing alive, butthe
cause thereof or“vital principle ”).
2Incalling the soul, aclucking
sound, represented inMalay bytheword kurorkerr,bywhich fowls are
called, isalmost always used;infact,
“kursemangat ”(“cluck! cluck!
soul !”)issuchacommon expression of
astonishment among theMalays that its
force islittlemore than“good gracious
me!”{vide infra,p.534, note).

itscorporeal owner.” Thus wefind thefollowing
appeal addressed tothesoul inthecharm just
quoted:—
“Do notbeargrudges,
Donotbear malice,
Donottake itasawrong,
Donottake itasatransgression.”
These quasi-human attributes ofthesoulbeing so
complete, itisaneasy stretch oftheimagination to
provide itwithahouse, which isgenerally inpractice
identified with thebody ofitsowner, butmay alsobe
identified with anyone ofitstemporary domiciles.
Thus inthecharm already quoted weread—
“Return toyourownHouse andHouse-ladder,
Toyourown House-floor, ofwhich theplanks have started,
Andyour Roof-thatch‘starred’with holes.”
The state ofdisrepair intowhich thesoul’s house
(i.e .thesickman’s body) isdescribed ashaving fallen,
ishere attributed tothe soul’s absence .1Thecom-
pleteness ofthis figurative identification ofthesoul’s
“house”with itsowner’s body, and ofthe soul’s
“sheath”orcasing with both, isvery clearly brought
outinthefollowing lines:—
“Cluck !cluck !Soul ofthissickman, So-and-so /
Return intotheFrame andBody ofSo-and-so,
ToyourownHouse andHouse-ladder, toyourownClearing and
Yard,
ToyourownParents, toyourownCasing.”
And this isnomere chance expression, forinanother
charm thesoul isadjured inthese words:—
1Inanother charm wefind thesickman’s body compared toaweather-
beaten barque atsea.


II CALLING THESOUL49
“Asyouremember yourown parents, remember me,
Asyouremember yourownHouse andHouse-ladder, remember
me.”1
Thesoul“appears tomen(bothwaking andasleep)
asaphantom separate from thebody ofwhich itbears
thelikeness,” “manifests physical power,” andwalks,
sits,andsleeps:—
“Cluck !cluck !Soul ofSo-and-so,come andwalk withme,
Come and sitwithme,
Come andsleep withme,andsharemypillow.”2
Itwould probably bewrong toassume thefore-
going expressions tohave always been merely figura-
tive. Rather, perhaps, weshould consider them aspart
ofasingularly complete andconsistent animistic system
formerly invented and stillheldbytheMalays. Again,
from theabove ideas itfollows that ifyou callasoul in
therightway itwillhearandobey you,andyou will
thusbeable either torecall toitsowners body asoul
which isescaping(riang semangat),ortoabduct the

such connection whatever. Andwhen youhave suc-
ceeded ingetting itintoyourpower theabducted and

2The entire conception ofthesoul
among theMalays agrees word forword
with Professor Tylor’s classical defini-tion inPrimitive Culture,vol. i.p.
387,andhence Ihave nothesitated to
usehisexact words insofarasthey

Every man issupposed (itwould appear from
Malay charms) topossess seven souls2inall,or,per-
haps, Ishould more accurately say,asevenfold soul .3
This “septenity inunity”mayperhaps beheld toex-
plain theremarkable importance andpersistency ofthe
number seven inMalay magic, asforinstance the
seven twigs ofthebirch, andtheseven repetitions of
thecharm (inSoul-abduction4
),theseven betel leaves,
theseven nights’ duration oftheceremony, theseven
blows administered tothesoul (inother magical and
medical ceremonies), andtheseven ears cutforthe

And, finally, itmight explain whythelime-branch
which ishung upinthemosquito-curtain (inanother
form ofsoul-abduction6
)isrequired topossess seven
fruits onasingle stalk, i.e.toensure there being a
separate receptacle foreachoneoftheseven souls.
Atthepresent daytheordinary Malay talks usually
ofonlyasingle soul, although he stillkeeps upthe
oldphraseology inhischarms andcharm-books. For
the rest, itwould appear that theremay besome
method intheselection andarrangement ofcolours.

impossible without more evidence to
determine. All that canbesaid is
that they were most probably seven

soul. Suchmight betheShadow-soul,
theReflection -soul, thePuppet -soul,
theBird-soul (?),theLife-soul, etc,but
asyetnoevidence isforthcoming.—

mischief” fromasickman), awhite cosmetic isassigned
foruse inthemorning, aredcosmetic formid-day,

Now inall, Ibelieve, ofwhat arenow called the
Federated Malay States, andprobably inallMalay
States whatsoever, yellow isthe colour used by
royalty, whereas themore exalted andsacred colour,
white (with occasional lapses into yellow), hasbeen
adopted byMalay medicine-men asthecolour most
likely toconciliate the spirits anddemons withwhom
theyhave todeal. Thus thesoul-cloth, which, bythe
way, isalways fivecubits long (limahasta),issometimes
white and(much more rarely) yellow, andhence inthe
firstinstance justquoted, theyellow cloth, being, next
towhite, ofthecolour which ismostcomplimentary to
thedemons, istheonewhich isputoutside;and in
thesecond instance, forsimilar reasons, thewhite
cosmetic istobeused first.
Theworking outofthissystem, however, must
await fresh evidence, and all Iwould donow isto
emphasise theimportance ofcolour insuch investi-
gations, andtourge thecollection offresh material .2

(d)Animal\Vegetable,andMineral Souls
Hitherto Ihave treated ofhuman souls only,
butanimal, mineral, andvegetable souls willnowbe
briefly discussed. Speaking generally, Ibelieve the
soul tobe,within certain limits, conceived asa
diminutive butexact counterpart of itsown em-
bodiment, sothatanAnimal-soul would belikean
animal, aBird-soul likeabird;however, lower inthe
scale ofcreation itwould appear that theTree- or
Ore-souls, forinstance, aresupposed, occasionally at
least, toassume theshape ofsome animal orbird.
Thus thesoulofEagle- wood isthought totake the
shape ofabird, thesoul ofTin-ore thatofabuffalo,
the Gold-soul that ofadeer .1Ithas,how-
ever, always been recognised that the soulmay
enter other bodies besides itsown, oreven bodies
ofadifferent kind to itsown, andhence these
may beonly apparent exceptions tothe rule that
thesoulshould bethecounterpart ofitsownembodi-
ment .2
“Among races within thelimits ofsavagery, the
general doctrine ofsouls isfound worked outwith
remarkable breadth and consistency. The souls of
animals arerecognised byanatural extension from
thetheory ofhuman souls;thesouls oftrees and
plants follow insome vague, partial way, andthe
issupposed tobetherarest ofitskind

also extremely rare, though itisoc-
casionally used forcertain decorative
work (e.g.small wedding-pillows).

souls ofinanimate objects expand thegeneral cate-
gory toitsextremest boundary.”1
TotheMalay whohasarrived attheidea ofa
generally animated Nature, buthasnotyetlearned to
draw scientific distinctions, there appears nothing
remarkable orunnatural intheideaofvegetation-souls,
oreven inthat ofmineral -souls—rather would he
consider usEuropeans illogical andinconsistent were
hetoldthatweallowed thepossession ofsouls toone
halfofthecreation anddenied ittotheother.
Realising this,weareprepared tofind that the
Malay theory ofAnimism embraces, atleast partially,
thehuman race,2animals3andbirds,4vegetation5(trees
and plants), reptiles and fishes,6until itsextension to
inert objects, such asminerals,7and“stocks andstones,
weapons, boats, food, clothes, ornaments, andother
objects, which tousarenotmerely soulless, but life-
less,” brings usface tofacewith aconception with
which “wearelesslikely tosympathise.”
Sidebysidewith thisgeneral conception ofanuni-
versally animate nature, wefindabundant evidences of
aspecial theory ofHuman Origin which isheld to
account notonly forthelarger mammals, butalso for
theexistence ofalargenumber ofbirds, andeven for
that ofafew reptiles, fishes, trees and plants, but
seems tolose itsoperative force inproportion toits
descent inthescale ofcreation, until inthelowest
