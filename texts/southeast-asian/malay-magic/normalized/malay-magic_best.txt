PREFACE
The circumstances attending thecomposition and
publication ofthepresent work have thrown upon
metheduty offurnishing itwith apreface explaining
itsobject andscope.
Briefly, thepurpose oftheauthor hasbeen to
collect intoaBook ofMalay Folklore allthatseemed
tohimmost typical ofthesubject amongst acon-
siderable mass ofmaterials, some ofwhich lay
scattered inthepages ofvarious other works, others
inunpublished native manuscripts, andmuch innotes
made byhim personally ofwhat hehadobserved
during several years spent intheMalay Peninsula,
principally intheState ofSelangor. Thebook does
notprofess tobeanexhaustive orcomplete treatise,
butrather, asitstitle indicates, anintroduction tothe
study ofFolklore, Popular Religion, andMagic as
understood among theMalays ofthePeninsula.
Itshould besuperfluous, atthistime ofday, to
defend such studies asthese from thecriticisms which
have from time totimebeen brought against them.
Iremember myoldfriend andformer teacher, Wan


Vlll PREFACE
'Abdullah, aSingapore Malay ofTrengganu extrac-
tionandArab descent, adevout andlearned Muham-
madan andamost charming man, objecting tothem
onthegrounds, first, that they were useless, and,
secondly, which, asheemphatically declared, was far
worse, thattheywere perilous tothesouls health.
This last isapoint ofview which itwould hardly
beappropriate orprofitable todiscuss here, buta
fewwords may aswellbedevoted totheother objec-
tion. Itisbased, sometimes, ontheground that
these studies deal notwith “facts,” butwithmere
nonsensical fancies and beliefs. Now, forfactswe
all,ofcourse, have thegreatest respect;butthe
objection appears tometoinvolve anunwarrantable
restriction ofthemeaning oftheword :abelief which
isactually held,even amere fancy that isentertained
inthemind, hasarealexistence, and isafactjustas
much asany other. Asapiece ofpsychology it
must always have acertain interest, and itmayon
occasions become ofenormous practical importance.
If,forinstance, in1857 certain persons, whose con-
cern itwas,hadpaidmore attention tofacts ofthis
kind, possibly theIndian Mutiny could have been
prevented, andprobably itmight havebeen foreseen,
sothatprecautionary measures could havebeen taken
intime tominimise theextent ofthecatastrophe.
Itisnotsuggested that thematters dealt with inthis
book areever likely toinvolve such serious issues;
but, speaking generally, there canbenodoubt


PREFACE IX
thatanunderstanding oftheideas andmodes of
thought ofanalien people inarelatively lowstage
ofcivilisation facilitates very considerably thetask
ofgoverning them;and intheMalay Peninsula
that task hasnowdevolved mainly upon English-
men. Moreover, every notion ofutility implies an
endtowhich itistobereferred, andthere areother
ends inlifeworth considering aswell asthose to
which the“practical man” ispleased torestrict
himself. When one passes from the practical to
thespeculative point ofview, itisalmost impos-
sible topredict what piece ofknowledge willbe
fruitful ofresults, andwhat willnot;
prima facie,
therefore, allknowledge has aclaim tobecon-
sidered ofimportance from ascientific point ofview,
and until everything isknown, nothing can safely
berejected asworthless.
Another andmore serious objection, aimed rather
atthemethod ofsuch investigations asthese, is
that theevidence withwhich theyhave tobecon-
tent isworth little ornothing. Objectors attempt
todiscredit itbyimplying that atbest itisonlywhat
A.says that B.toldhimabout thebeliefs B.sayshe
holds, inother words, that itisthemerest hearsay;
and itisalsosometimes suggested thatwhen A.
isaEuropean and B.asavage, oratmost asemi-
civilised person ofanother breed, thechances are
that B.will lieabout hisalleged beliefs, orthat
A.willunconsciously read hisown ideas into B.’s


X PREFACE
confused statements, orthat, atany rate,onewayor
another, they aresure tomisunderstand each other,
andaccordingly therecord cannot beafaithful one.
Sofarasthis objection canhave any applica-
tion tothepresent work, itmay fairly bereplied :
first that theauthor hasbeen atsome pains to
corroborate and illustrate hisown accounts bythe
independent observations ofothers (and thismust
behisjustification forthecopiousness ofhisquota-
tions from other writers);and, secondly, thathehas,
whenever possible, given uswhat isreally thebest
kind ofevidence forhisown statements byrecord-
ingthecharms andother magic formulae which are
actually inuse.Ofthese agreat number hasbeen
here collected, and inthetranslation ofsuch ofthe
more interesting ones asarequoted inthetext of
thebook, every effort hasbeenmade tokeep to
literal accuracy ofrendering. The originals willbe
found intheAppendix, and itmust belefttothose
whocanreadMalay tocheck theauthor’s versions,
and todraw from the untranslated portions such
inferences asmayseem tothem good.
The author himself hasnopreconceived thesis
tomaintain :hisobject hasbeen collection rather
than comparison, and quite apart from theneces-
sary limitations ofspace and time, hismethod has
confined thebook within fairly well-defined bounds.
Though thesubject isonewhich would naturally
lend itself toacomparative treatment, andthough


PREFACE XI
thecomparison ofMalay folklore with that ofother
nations (more particularly ofIndia, Arabia, and the
mainland ofIndo- China) would nodoubt lead to
very interesting results, thescope ofthework has
asfaraspossible been restricted tothefolklore of
theMalays ofthePeninsula. Accordingly theana-
logous and often quite similar customs andideas of
theMalayan races oftheEastern Archipelago have
been only occasionally referred to,while those of
theChinese andother non-Malayan inhabitants of
thePeninsula havebeen excluded altogether.
Moreover, several important departments ofcus-
tomand social lifehave been, nodoubt designedly,
omitted :thus, tomention onlyonesubject outof
several that willprobably occur tothe reader, the
modes oforganisation oftheFamily and theClan
(which incertain Malay communities present archaic
features ofnocommon interest), together with the
derivative notions affecting thetenure and inherit-
ance ofproperty, have found noplace inthiswork.
The field, infact, isvery wide andcannot allbe
worked atonce. The folklore ofuncivilised races
may fairly enough besaid toembrace every phase
ofnature andevery department oflife :itmaybe
regarded ascontaining, inthegerm and asyetun-
differentiated, thenotions from which Religion, Law,
Medicine, Philosophy, Natural Science, and Social
Customs areeventually evolved. Itsbulkand rela-
tiveimportance seem tovary inversely with the


Xll PREFACE
advance ofarace intheprogress towards civilisa-
tion;and theideas ofsavages onthese matters
appear toconstitute insome cases agreat and
complex system, ofwhich comparatively fewtraces
only are leftamong themore civilised peoples.
TheMalay race, while farremoved from thesavage
condition, hasnotasyetreached avery high stage
ofcivilisation, and still retains relatively large rem-
nants ofthis primitive order ofideas. Itistrue
thatMalay notions onthese subjects areunder-
going aprocess ofdisintegration, the rapidity of
which hasbeen considerably increased bycontact
with European civilisation, but, such asthey are,
these ideas stillform agreat factor inthe lifeofthe
mass ofthepeople.
Itmay, however, bedesirable topoint outthat
thecomplexity ofMalay folklore istobeattributed
inpart to itssingularly mixed character. The
development oftherace from savagery and bar-
barism uptoitspresent condition ofcomparative
civilisation hasbeen modified anddetermined, first
andmost deeply byIndian, and during the last
five centuries orsobyArabian influences. Just
asinthelanguage oftheMalays itispossible by
analysis topick outwords ofSanskrit andArabic
torigin from amongst themain body ofgenuinely
native words, sointheir folklore one finds Hindu,
Buddhist, andMuhammadan ideas overlying amass
ofapparently original Malay notions.


PREFACE xm
These various elements oftheir folklore are,how-
ever,now sothoroughly mixed uptogether that it
isoften almost impossible todisentangle them. No
systematic attempt hasbeenmade todosointhis
book, although hereand there anindication ofthe
origin ofsome particular myth willbefound;but
acomplete analysis (ifpossible atall)would have
necessitated, asapreliminary investigation, amuch
deeper study ofHindu andMuhammadan mythology
than ithasbeen found practicable toengage in.
Inorder, however, togive aclear notion ofthe
relation which thebeliefs and practices that arehere
recorded bear tothe official religion ofthepeople,
itisnecessary tostate that theMalays ofthePenin-
sulaareSunniMuhammadans oftheschool ofShafki,
and that nothing, theoretically speaking, could be
more correct andorthodox (from thepoint ofview
ofIslam) than thebelief which they profess.
But the beliefs which they actually hold are
another matter altogether, and itmust beadmitted
that theMuhammadan veneer which covers their
ancient superstitions isvery often ofthethinnest
description. The inconsistency inwhich this in-
volves them isnot,however, asarule realised by
themselves. Beginning their invocations with the
orthodox preface :“Inthename ofGod\themerciful,
thecompassionate ,”andending them withanappeal
totheCreed :“There isnogodbutGod
,andMu-
hammad istheApostle ofGodP they areconscious


XIV PREFACE
ofnoimpropriety inaddressing the intervening
matter toastring ofHindu Divinities, Demons,
Ghosts, andNature Spirits, with afewAngels and
Prophets thrown in,astheoccasion mayseem to
require. Still, themore highly educated Malays,
especially thosewho live inthetowns andcome into
direct contact withArab teachers ofreligion, are
disposed toobject strongly tothese“relics ofpagan-
ism”
;andthere canbenodoubt thattheincreasing
diffusion ofgeneral education inthePeninsula is
contributing tothegrowth ofastricter conception
ofIslam, which willinvolve thegradual suppression
ofsuch ofthese old-world superstitions asareob-
viously ofan“unorthodox” character.
This process, however, willtake several genera-
tions toaccomplish, and inthemeantime itistobe
hoped thatacomplete record willhave beenmade
both ofwhat isdoomed sooner orlater toperish,
andofwhat inalllikelihood willsurvive under the
new conditions ofourtime. Itisasacontribution
tosuch arecord, and asacollection ofmaterials
toserve asasound basis forfurther additions and
comparisons, that thiswork isoffered tothereader.
Alistoftheprincipal authorities referred towill
befound inanother place, but itwould beimproper
toomit here theacknowledgments which aredue
tothevarious authors ofwhose work inthis field
such wide usehasbeen made. Among thedead
special mention must bemade ofMarsden, who will


PREFACE XV
always beforEnglishmen thepioneer ofMalay
studies;Leyden, thegifted translator oftheSe-
jarah Malayu, whose early death probably inflicted
onOriental scholarship thegreatest loss ithasever
had tosuffer;Newbold, theauthor ofwhat isstill,
onthewhole, thebestwork ontheMalay Peninsula;
andSirWilliam Maxwell, inwhom those ofuswho
knew himhave lostafriend, andMalay scholarship
athoroughly sound andmost brilliant exponent.
Among the living, theacknowledgments ofthe
author aredue principally toSirFrank Swetten-
hamandMr.Hugh Clifford, who, while theyhave
donemuch topopularise theknowledge ofthings
Malay amongst thegeneral reading public, have
alsoembodied intheir works theresults ofmuch
careful and accurate observation. The free use
which hasbeenmade ofthewritings ofthese and
other authors will, itishoped, beheld tobejustified
bytheir intrinsic value.
Itmustbeadded that theauthor, having toleave
England about thebeginning ofthisyear with the
Cambridge scientific expedition which isnowexplor-
ingtheNorthern States ofthePeninsula, leftthe
work withmeforrevision. The first fiveChapters
andChapter VI.,uptotheend ofthesection on
Dances, Sports, andGames, were then already in
the printer’s hands, butonly the firstioopages or
sohadhadthebenefit oftheauthor’s revision. For
thearrangement oftherestofChapter VI.,and for


XVI PREFACE
some small portion ofthematter therein contained,
Iamresponsible, and ithasalsobeenmyduty to
revise thewhole book finally. Accordingly, itis
only fair totheauthor topoint outthathe istobe
credited with thematter andthegeneral scheme of
thework, while theresponsibility fordefects indetail
must fallupon myself.
Asregards thespelling ofMalay words, itmust
besaid thatgeographical names have been spelled
inthewaywhich isnow usually adopted andwithout
diacritical marks :thenames oftheprincipal Native
States ofthePeninsula (most ofwhich arerepeatedly
mentioned inthebook) areKedah, Perak, Selangor,
Johor, Pahang, Trengganu, Kelantan, and Patani.
Otherwise, except inquotations (where thespelling
oftheoriginal ispreserved), anattempt hasbeen
made totransliterate theMalay w’ords found inthe
body ofthebook insuch away astogive the
ordinary reader afairly correct idea oftheir pro-
nunciation. The Appendix, which appeals only to
persons who already know Malay, hasbeen some-
what differently treated, diacritical marks being in-
serted only incases where there was apossible
ambiguity, and thespelling ofthe original MSS.
being changed aslittle aspossible.
Aperfect transliteration, orone that will suit
everybody, is,however, anunattainable ideal, and
themost thatcanbedone inthat direction isneces-
sarily acompromise. Inthesystem adopted inthe


PREFACE xvn
body ofthework, thevowels are tobesounded
(roughly speaking) asinItalian, except e(which
resembles theFrench einque,le>andthe like), and
theconsonants asinEnglish (butngasinsinger,
notfinger;gasingo;nyasniinonion;chasin
chiirch;finalkand initial halmost inaudible). The
symbol‘represents theArabic‘ain,andthesymbol’
isused (i)between consonants, toindicate thepres-
ence ofanalmost inaudible vowel, theshortest form
ofe,andelsewhere(2)forthehamzah,and(3)for
theapostrophe, i.e.todenote thesuppression ofa
letter orsyllable. Both thelainand thehamzah
maybeneglected inpronunciation, asindeed they
arevery generally disregarded bytheMalays them-
selves. Inthisandother respects, Arabic scholars
intowhose hands thisbookmay fallmust notbe
surprised tofind thatArabic words and phrases
suffer some corruptions inaMalay context. These
have not, asarule, been interfered with orcor-
rected, although ithas notbeen thought worth
while topreserve obvious blunders ofspelling in
well-known Arabic formulae. Itshould beadded
that inMalay theaccent orstress, which isless
marked than inEnglish, falls almost invariably on
thepenultimate syllable oftheword. Exceptions to
this rulehardly ever occur except inthefewcases
where thepenultimate isanopen syllable with ashort
vowel, asindicated bythesign\

CHAPTER I
Nature
(a)Creation oftheWorld
The theory oftheCreation most usually held by
Peninsular Malays issummarised inthefollowing
passage, quoted (in1839) byLieutenant Newbold
from aMalay folk-tale:—
“From theSupreme Being firstemanated light
towards chaos;this light, diffusing itself, became the
vast ocean. From thebosom ofthewaters thick
vapour andfoam ascended. The earth andseawere
thenformed, each ofseven tiers. Theearth rested on
thesurface ofthewater from east towest. God, in
order torender steadfast thefoundations oftheworld,
which vibrated tremulously with themotion ofthe
watery expanse, girt itround with anadamantine
chain, viz.thestupendous mountains ofCaucasus, the
wondrous regions ofgenii and aerial spirits. Beyond
these limits isspread outavast plain, thesandand
earth ofwhich areofgold andmusk, thestones
rubies and emeralds, thevegetation ofodoriferous
flowers.
“From therange ofCaucasus allthemountains of


2 NATURE CHAP.
theearth have their origin aspillars tosupport and
strengthen theterrestrial framework.”1
TheMountains ofCaucasus areusually called by
Malays BukitKof(i.e .Kaf), ortheMountains ofKaf
(which latter istheirArabic name). These mountains are
notunfrequently referred toinMalay charms, e.g.inin-
vocations addressed totheRice-Spirit. TheMountains
ofKafaretotheMalays agreat range which serves
asa“wall”(dividing') totheearth, andkeeps offboth
excessive winds andbeasts ofprey. This wall,how-
ever, isbeing bored through bypeople called Yajuj
andMajuj (Gog andMagog), andwhen theysucceed
intheir tasktheendofallthings willcome. Besides
these mountains which surround theearth there isa
great central mountain called Mahameru (Saguntang
Maha Biru, ormerely Saguntang-guntang).2In
many Malay stories this hillMahameru isidentified
withSaguntang-guntang ontheborders ofPalembang
inSumatra.
The account which Ishallnow give, however,
differs considerably from thepreceding. Itwastaken
down bymefrom anintroduction toaMalay charm-
book belonging toamagician (one‘Abdul Razzak of
Klang inSelangor), withwhom Iwasacquainted, but
who,though heallowed metocopy it,would notallow
meeither tobuyorborrow thebook :3—

Darkness Haze, when theLord oftheOuter Silence
Himself wasyet inthewomb ofCreation, before the

umbrella, which aretheuniverse oftheMagician.
Now from before thebeginning oftime existed that
Magician—that is,God—andHemade Himself mani-
festwith thebrightness ofthemoon and thesun,
which isthetoken oftheTrue Magician.”
The account proceeds todescribe howGod
'‘created thepillar oftheKa'bah,1which istheNavel
oftheEarth, whose growth iscomparable toaTree,
. . .whose branches arefour innumber, and are
called, the first,‘Sajeratul Mentahar,’ andthesecond
‘Taubi,’ andthethird,‘Khaldi,’ andthefourth ‘Nasrun
‘Alam,’ which extend unto thenorth, south, east,and
west,where they arecalled theFour Corners ofthe
World.”
Nextweread thattheword ofGodAlmighty came
insecret toGabriel, saying, “Takemedown theiron
staff ofthe‘Creed’which dangles atthegate of
heaven, and killme this serpent Sakatimuna.”2
Gabriel did so,andtheserpent brake asunder, the
headandforepart shooting upabove theheavens, and

The most curious feature ofthedescription is
perhaps themarked anthropomorphic character of
thisserpent, which shows ittobeaserpent inlittle
more thanname. Itseems, infact,veryprobable that
wehave here areminiscence oftheIndian “Naga.”1
Thuswefindtherainbow (here divided into itscom-
ponent parts) described asoriginating from theserpent’s
sword with itshiltandcross-piece (guard), grass from
thehair ofitsbody, trees from thehairofitshead,
rainfrom itstears, anddewfrom itssweat.
Another account, alsoobtained from alocal magi-
cian, contains oneortwo additional details about the
tree. “Kun” saidGod, “Payah'1kun” saidMuham-
mad,andaseedwascreated.
“The seedbecame aroot (lit.sinew), theroot a
tree,andthetreebrought forth leaves.
“ lKunl saidGod,‘Payahkun,’saidMuhammad;
. ..Then wereHeaven andEarth (created), ‘Earth
ofthewidth ofatray,Heaven ofthewidth ofan
umbrella.’”
This isacurious passage, andonenotover-easy to
1TheNagas aregenerally repre-
sented inoldsculptures asbearing the
human form, butwith asnake attached
totheir backs, and thehooded head
rising behind their necks.—Naga-
nanda,translated byPalmer Boyd,
p.61;vide also id.p.84. This
maybetheexplanation oftheMalay
k'ris hilt, ordagger hilt,which repre-
sents aseated human form with folded
arms andahood attheback ofits
neck rising over itshead. These
hilts are called hulu Malayu (the
“Malay hilt”), orJawa demam (lit.
the“Fever-stricken Javanese”), inallu-
sion totheattitude ofthefigure withitsfolded arms. Thepattern ofthese
hilts,which areuniversally used forthe
national Malay k’ris ordagger, varies
from anaccurate representation ofthe
human figure toforms inwhich nothing
butthehood(which isoccasionally much
exaggerated) isrecognisable. Euro-
peans seeing these hilts forthe first
timesometimes takethem forsnakes’
heads, sometimes fortheheads ofbirds.

“Most Malays,” says Newbold, “with whom I
have conversed onthesubject, imagine thattheworld
isofanoval shape, revolving upon itsown axis four
times inthespace ofoneyear;thatthesun isacircular
body offiremoving round theearth, andproducing
thealternations ofnight andday.”
To this Iwould add thatsome Malays, at
least,whom Iquestioned onthesubject (aswell as
some Sakais1under Malay influence), imagined the
firmament toconsist ofasortofstone orrockwhich
they called Batuhampar,or“Bed rock,” theappear-

byNewbold :2—
“Some Malays ascribe thetides totheinfluence

oftheCocosMaldiva,ofwhich SirH.
Yule, s.v.Coco-de-Mer, gives the fol-
lowing interesting account :—
“Coco-de-Mer,orDouble Coco-nut,
thecurious twin fruit socalled, the
produce oftheL'odoicea Sechellarumy
apalm growing only intheSeychelles
Islands, iscastupontheshores ofthe
Indian Ocean, most frequently onthe
Maidive Islands, butoccasionally also
onCeylon and S.India, andonthe
coasts ofZanzibar, ofSumatra, and
some others oftheMalay Islands.
Great virtues asmedicine andantidote
weresupposed toreside inthese fruits,
andextravagant prices were paid for
them. The story goes thata‘country
captain,’ expecting tomake hisfortune,
took acargo ofthese nutsfrom the
Seychelles Islands toCalcutta, butthe
only result was todestroy their value
forthefuture.“The oldbelief wasthatthefruitwas
produced onapalm growing below the
sea,whose fronds, according toMalay
seamen, were sometimes seen inquiet
bights ontheSumatran coast, especially
intheLampong Bay. According to
oneform ofthestoryamong theMalays,
which istoldbothbyPigafetta andby
Rumphius, therewasbutonesuch tree,
thefronds ofwhich roseabove an
abyss oftheSouthern Ocean, andwere
theabode ofthemonstrous birdGaruda
(orRukh oftheArabs). The tree
itself was called Pau-sengi,which
Rumphius seems tointerpret asa
corruption ofBuwa-zangi,*Fruit of
Zang,’ orE.Africa. They were cast
upoccasionally ontheislands ofthe
S.W. coast ofSumatra;and the
wild people ofthe islands brought
them forsale totheSumatran marts,
such asPadang andPriamang. One
ofthelargest (sayabout twelve inches
across) would sell for150 rixdollars.
ButtheMalay princes coveted them
greatly, andwould sometimes (itwas
alleged) givealaden junk forasingle
nut. InIndia thebest-known source
ofsupply was from the Maidive
Islands.
“The medical virtues ofthenutwere
notonlyfamous among allthepeople
oftheEast, including theChinese, but

withmany details. The latter, learned

there sitsagigantic crabwhich twice adaygets out

supposed tocause therising ofthe tide, while the

Hobson-Jobson,loc. cit.
Tothisvaluable note Iwould add
thatRumphius isevidently wrong ifhe
derives thename ofthe tree,“Pau-
sengi,” from theMalay “Buwa-zangi.”
The first part oftheword is“Pau”or“Pauli,” which isperfectly good
Malay, and isthename given to
various species ofmango, especially
thewild one, sothat“Pau-sengi”
actually represents (not“Buwa,”
but)“Pauh Janggi,” which istothis
daytheuniversal Malay name forthe
treewhich grows, according toMalay
fable, inthe central whirlpool or
Navel oftheSeas. Some versions add
that itgrows upon asunken bank
(tebing runtoh),and isguarded by
dragons. This tree figures largely in
Malay romances, especially those which
form thesubject ofMalay shadow-
plays, {vide infra,PI.23,foranillustra-
tionofthePauh Janggi andtheCrab).
Rumphius’ explanation ofthesecond
part ofthename (i.e.Janggi) is,no
doubt, quite correct.

house, heralding herdiscovery byloud shouts toher
husband. The couple adopted thechild willingly, for
theyhadnochildren, andthey treated herthence-
forward astheir own. They assembled thevillagers
andgave them afeast, solemnly announcing their
adoption ofthedaughter ofthe river and their
intention ofleaving tohereverything that they
possessed.
“The childwas called TanPuteh, butherfather

The usual story ofthe firstcreation ofman,how-
ever, appears tobeaMalay modification ofArabic
beliefs.
Thuswearetold thatmanwascreated from the
fourelements—earth, air,water, and fire—inaway
which thefollowing extract, .taken from aSelangor
charm-book, willexplain:—
“GodAlmighty spake unto Gabriel, saying,
‘Benotdisobedient, OGabriel,
ButgoandgetmetheHeart oftheEarth .5
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.
‘Iwillnotgive it,5saidtheEarth.
Then went theProphet Israfel toget it,
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.

Then went Michael toget it,
Buthecould notgettheHeart oftheEarth.
Then went Azrael toget it,
And atlasthegottheHeart oftheEarth.
When hegottheHeart oftheEarth
Theempyrean andcrystalline spheres shook,
Andthewhole Universe (shook).
When hegottheHeart oftheEarth he1made from ittheImage of
Adam.
ButtheHeart oftheEarth wasthen toohard;
Hemixed Water with it,and itbecame too soft,
(So)hemixed Firewith it,and atlaststruck outtheimage ofAdam.
Then heraised uptheimage ofAdam,
Andcraved Life for itfromAlmighty God,
AndGodAlmighty gave itLife.
Then sneezed GodAlmighty, andtheimage ofAdam brake inpieces,
Andhe(Azrael) returned toremake theimage ofAdam.
ThenGodAlmighty commanded totake steel ofKhorassan,
And drive itdown hisback, sothat itbecame thethirty-three bones.
Theharder steel atthetop,thesofter below it.
Theharder steel shotupskywards,
And thesofter steel penetrated earthwards.
Thus theimage ofAdam had life,anddwelt inParadise.
(There) Adam beheld (two?)peacocks ofnoordinary beauty,
And theAngel Gabriel appeared.

Easier isittoliveinpairs, Icrave awife.’
GodAlmighty spake, saying,‘Command Adam
Topray atdawn aprayer oftwogenuflexions.’
ThenAdam prayed, andourLadyEvedescended,
Andwascaptured bytheProphet Adam;
Butbefore hehadfinished hisprayer shewastaken back,
Therefore Adam prayed theprayer oftwogenuflexions asdesired,
And atthelastobtained ourLady Eve.
When theyweremarried (Eve) bore twins every time,
Until shehadborne forty-four children,
And thechildren, too,were wedded, handsome withhandsome, and
plain with plain.”
The magician who dictated theabove account
stated thatwhen Azrael stretched forth hishand to
take theHeart oftheEarth, theEarth-spirit caught
hold ofhismiddle finger, which yielded tothestrain,
andthusbecame longer than therest,andreceived its
Malay name ofthe“Devils Finger” (jari kantu).
1ItisGabriel whoperforms this office intheaccount which follows.


II ANOTHER ACCOUNT 21
Aparallel account adds thattheHeart oftheEarth
waswhite, andgives afuller description oftheinter-
viewbetween Azrael andhisformidable antagonist, the
Earth. After saluting the latter intheorthodox
Muhammadan fashion, Azrael explains hismission,
and ismetbyapoint-blank refusal. “Iwillnot
give it,”said theEarth (referring toitsHeart),
“forasmuch as Iwassocreated byGodAlmighty,
and ifyoutakeawaymyHeart Ishall assuredly die.”
Atthisbrusque, though perhaps natural retort, the
archangel loses histemper, andrudely exclaims that
he“will take theEarth’s Heart whether itwill
orno.” Here Azrael “gave theEarth apush with
hisrighthand andhis left,andgrasping attheHeart
oftheEarth, gothold ofitandcarried itback tothe
presence ofGod.” Godnowsummons Gabriel and
orders him tomould (lit.forge) theimage ofAdam.
Then Gabriel took thelump ofearth which wasthe
Earth’s Heart andmixed itfirstwith water tosoften
it,then, asitwastoo soft,with fire toharden it,and
when theimage wasmade, obtained lifefromGod to
put into it.1[The breaking ofthe firstimage which

theangels Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil
were sentbyGod,oneafter another, to
fetch forthatpurpose seven handfuls
ofearth from different depths, andof
different colours (whence some account
forthevarious complexions ofmankind);
buttheEarth being apprehensive ofthe
consequence, and desiring them to
represent her fear toGod that the

rebel against Him,anddrawdown His
curse upon her,theyreturned without

thebirth ofher first-born aredescribed, the latter
occasion being accompanied byathick darkness, which
compelled Adam totake offhisturban andbeat the
child therewith inorder todispel the evilinfluences
(badi)which hadattended itsbirth.1
Thefollowing extract (from aMalay treatise quoted
byNewbold) fairly describes thegeneral state ofMalay
ideas respecting theconstitution ofthehuman body :—
“Plato, Socrates,. Galen, Aristotle, andother philo-
sophers affirm thatGod created manofafixednumber
ofbones, blood-vessels, etc.Forinstance, theskull is
composed of5Jbones, theplace ofsmellandsense of7
bones, between thisandtheneck are32bones. The
neck iscomposed of7bones, andtheback of24bones;
208bones arecontained intheothermembers ofthe
body. Inallthere are360bones and360blood-vessels
inaman’s body. The brains weigh 306miscals,the
blood 573. The total ofallthebones, blood-vessels,
large and small, and gristles, amounts to1093 iand
thehairs ofthehead tosixlacsand4000. Theframe
ofman isdivided into40great parts, which areagain
superior, took asecret resolution never
toacknowledge him assuch. After
thisGod animated thefigure ofclay
andendued itwithanintelligent soul,
andwhenHehadplaced him inpara-
dise,formed Eveoutofhisleftside.”—
Sale’s Kor&n, ch. ii.(oftranslation),
p.4(note).
1“TheCreator determined tomake
man, and forthatpurpose Hetook
some clayfrom theearthandfashioned
itintothefigure ofaman. ThenHe
took theSpirit ofLife toendue this
body with vitality, andplaced thespirit
onthehead ofthe figure. Butthe
spiritwasstrong, andthebody, being
only clay, could nothold it,andwasreft inpieces and scattered into the
air. Those fragments ofthe firstgreat
Failure arethespirits ofearth andsea
and air.
“The Creator thenformed another
clay figure, but into thisoneHe
wrought some iron, sothatwhen it
received the vital spark itwithstood
thestrain andbecame Man. That
manwasAdam, andtheiron that isin
theconstitution ofhisdescendants has
stood them ingood stead. When they
lose ittheybecome of little more
account than their prototype the first

viz. air, fire, earth, andwater. With these elements
areconnected four essences—thesoul orspirit with
air,lovewith fire,concupiscence with earth, andwisdom
with water.”1
(b)Sanctity oftheBody
Indealing with thisbranch ofthesubject Iwill
firsttake thecaseofthekings and priestly magicians
who present themost clearly- marked examples of
personal sanctity which arenow tobefound among
Malays, and willthen describe thechief features of
thesanctity ascribed toallranks alike inrespect of
certain special parts oftheordinary human anatomy.
The theory oftheking astheDivine Man isheld
perhaps asstrongly intheMalay region asinany
other part oftheworld, afactwhich isstrikingly
emphasised bythealleged right ofMalay monarchs
“toslay atpleasure,without being guilty ofa
crime." Not only istheking’s person considered
sacred, butthesanctity ofhisbody isbelieved to
communicate itself tohisregalia, and toslaythose
whobreak theroyal taboos. Thus itisfirmly be-
lieved thatanyonewho seriously offends theroyal
person, who touches (even foramoment) orwho
imitates (even with theking’s permission) thechief

bekena daulat,i.e.struck dead, byaquasi -electric
discharge ofthatDivine Power which theMalays
suppose toreside intheking’s person,1andwhich
iscalled “Daulat”or“Royal Sanctity.” Before I
proceed, however, todiscuss thispower, itwillbebest
togivesome description oftheregalia inwhich it
resides:—
OfMalacca Newbold says :“The articles ofMalay
regalia usually consist ofasilasila,orbook ofgenealo-
gical descent, acode oflaws, avest orbaju,anda
fewweapons, generally akrisykleywang, orspear.”2
“The limbing isasort oflance;thetombak
bandrang aspear ofstate, fourorseven ofwhich are
usually carried before thechiefs intheinterior ofthe
Peninsula. The handle iscovered with asubstance
flowing from itlike ahorse -tail,dyed crimson,
sometimes crimson andwhite;this isgenerally of
hair.”3
SoinLeyden’s translation oftheMalay Annals
(1821) weread—
“Myname isBichitram Shah, whoam raja.
. . .This isthesword, Chora samendang kian
(i.e.mandakini\ and that isthelance, Limbuar (i.e.
limbuara);this isthesignet, Cayu Gampit, which is

“TheChora samedang kian (i.e.mandakini)isthe

them tooaccurately. InPerak the
custom would appear tobe less
strict. Thus from Malay Sketches
(p.215)wemay gather that inthe
“silver” state even themost sacred
pieces oftheregalia accompany the
royal party upon their annual expedi-
tion toseek forturtles’ eggs.1“Thekabesaran orregalia ofevery

II CHARACTERISTICS OFROYALTY 29
Buttheextraordinary strength oftheMalay belief
inthesupernatural powers oftheregalia oftheir
sovereigns canonly bethoroughly realised after a
study oftheir romances, inwhich their kings are
credited with alltheattributes ofinferior gods, whose
birth, asindeed every subsequent actoftheir after life,
isattended bythemostamazing prodigies.
They areusually invulnerable, and are gifted
with miraculous powers, such asthat oftransforming
themselves, andofreturning to(orrecalling others
to) life;infactthey have, inevery way, lessofthe
man about them andmore ofthegod. Thus it
isthat thefollowing description ofthedress of
anold-time Raja falls easily into line with what
would otherwise appear theobjectless jargon which
stillconstitutes thepreamble ofmany aMalay prince’s
letters, butwhich canyetbehardly regarded asmere
rhetoric, since ithasadeepmeaning forthosewho
read it:—
“He wore the trousers called beraduwanggi,
miraculously made without letting inpieces;hundreds
ofmirrors encircled hiswaist, thousands encircled his
bythePower ofGodAlmighty andthe
virtue ofadescendant ofRajaSecander
Zulkarneini, thewater within these
circles became fresh, and allthecrews
supplied themselves with it,andunto
thisdaythefresh water ismixed with
thesaltatthisplace.” (3)Thehorse,
which isusually called “Sembrani,”
isamagic steed, “which could fly

toMalay sovereigns ofthe firstrank.
Similar sacred objects, belonging toanother Sultan of“Menangcabow”
named “Gaggar Allum”(Gegar ‘Alam),

“At funerals, whether thedeceased hasbeen a

II LINGUISTIC TABOOS35
ashavebeen mentioned, SirW.E.Maxwell mentions
three royal perquisites(larangan raja), i.e.river turtles
(tuntong)(bywhich henodoubt means their eggs);
elephants (bywhich hedoubtless means elephants’
tusks);1andthe fruitofthe“ketiarj

ismade bythePerak Malays. Headds, “Itused to

Besides theabove there arenotafew linguistic

deceased,” with theaddition ofanexpression
alluding tosome prominent fact inhis life,oroccasion-
allytotheplace ofhisdecease. These titles, strange
asitmayseem, areoften thereverse ofcomplimentary,
andoccasionally ridiculous .1
Itmust notbeforgotten, too, indiscussing the
divine attributes oftheMalay king, thatheisfirmly
believed topossess apersonal influence overtheworks
ofnature, such asthegrowth ofthecrops andthe
bearing offruit-trees. Thissame property issupposed
toreside inalesser degree inhisdelegates, andeven
inthepersons ofEuropeans incharge ofdistricts.
Thus Ihave frequently known (inSelangor) thesuc-
cessorfailure ofthericecrops attributed toachange
ofdistrict officers, and inonecase Ieven heard an
outbreak offerocity which occurred among man-eating
crocodiles laid atthedoor ofamost zealous andable,
though perhaps occasionally somewhat unsympathetic,

p.218,where thesame listoflinguistic
taboos appears tobeused inPerak.

custom ofMalays todiscontinue after
thedeath ofaking theuseofthe title

title isinvented forthe deceased
monarch, bywhich he isever after-

similar custom among other Indo-
Chinese races hasbeen noticed by
Colonel Yule :‘‘There isalsoacustom
ofdropping orconcealing theproper
name oftheking. This exists in
Burma and(according toLaLoubere) inSiam. The various kings ofthose
countries aregenerally distinguished by
some nickname derived from facts in
their reign orpersonal relations, and
applied tothem after their decease.
Thus wehearamong theBurmese
kings of‘theking dethroned by
foreigners,’ ‘the kingwho fledfrom
theChinese,’ ‘the grandfather king,’
andeven ‘the king thrown into the
water.’ Now thishasaclose parallel

II SALUTATION 37

Officers temporary absence, themere fact ofhis
absence wasconsidered significant. Imayadd that
royal blood issupposed bymany Malays tobewhite,
and this isthepivot onwhich theplotofnotafew
Malay folk-tales ismade toturn .1
Finally, itmust bepointed outthat thegreatest
possible importance isattached tothemethod ofsalut-
ingtheking.
Inthe“SriRama” (theMalay Ramayana) we
read,even ofthechiefs,that—
“While yetsomeway offtheybowed tothedust,
When they gotneartheymade obeisance,
Uplifting ateach step their fingers ten,
Thehands closed together liketherootlets ofthebakong palm2
The fingers oneontheother likeapileofsirih2leaves.”8
Equals inrankwhen saluting oneanother touch4
(though theydonotshake) each other’s hands, but
aperson ofhumble birth must nottouch hands
insaluting agreat chief. “Aman,named Imam
Bakar, wasonce slain atPasirTambang, atthemouth
oftheTembeling river. Heincautiously touched
hands ingreeting with aChief called To’Gajah, and
the latter, seizing him inaniron grip, heldhim fast,
while hewasstabbed todeath with spears.”5
Insaluting agreat Chief, liketheDato’ Maharaja

Insaluting areal Raja, thehands arecarried
higher and higher, according tothe prince’s rank,
until, fortheSultan, thetipsofthethumbs areon
alevel with theforehead. Little details such as
these areofimmense importance intheeyes ofthe
Malays, andnotwithout reason, seeing that inan
Independent Native Statemany amanhascomebyhis
death forcarelessness intheirobservance.”1
Intheking’s audience hall theformal saluta-
tions areperformed inasitting posture, and in
this case, too, thegreatest attention ispaid tothe
height towhich thehands areraised. Thechief twice
makes salutation inasitting posture asheadvances,
and atthethird advance bends over the Sultan’s
hands, twomore salutations being made onhisway
back tohisplace.
Aflagrant infringement ofanyoftheprerogatives
oftheSultan, such asthose Ihave described, iscertain,
itisthought, toprove fatal,more orlessimmediately.
Thus thedeath ofPenghulu Mohit, awell-known
Malay headman oftheKlang district, inSelangor, which
took place while Iwas incharge ofthat district, was
atthetime very generally attributed bythe local
Malays tohisusurpation ofcertain royal privileges
orprerogatives ontheoccasion ofhisdaughter’s
wedding. One ofthese was hisacceptance ofgift-

buffaloes, decorated after theroyal fashion, which were
presented tohim aswedding gifts inhisdaughter’s
honour. These buffaloes hadacovering ofcloth put
overthem, their horns covered, andacrescent-shaped
breast -ornament(dokoh)hung about their necks.
Thus dressed theywere taken toMohit’s house in
solemn procession.1Itwas, atthetime, considered
significant that thevery first ofthese gift-buffaloes,
which hadbeen brought overland from Jugra, where
theSultan lived, haddiedonarrival, andwhatever
thecausemayhave been, itisafact thatMohit’s
mother died adayortwo after theconclusion ofthe
wedding ceremonies, and thatMohit himself was
taken illalmost immediately anddied only about a
fortnight later.
The only person who, informer days, wasnot
intheleast affected bytheroyal taboos which pro-
tected theregalia from thecommon touch wasthe
(now Ibelieve extinct) official who held thepost of
Court Physician (Maharaja Lela). He,andhealone,

chose, andtheimmunity andfreedom which heen-
joyed inthisrespect passed intoaproverb, theex-
pression “toacttheCourt Physician ”(buatMaharaja
Lela) being used todescribe analtogether unwarrant-
able familiarity orimpertinence.
Thefollowing story (though Itell itagainst myself)
isperhaps thebest illustration Icangive ofthegreat
danger supposed tobeincurred bythosewhomeddle
with theparaphernalia ofroyalty. Among the late
Sultan’s insignia ofroyalty (in1897) were acouple of

ofinfinite annoyance andanxiety totheinmates on
account oftheir veryuncanny behaviour !
Drops ofperspiration, forinstance, would formupon
theTrumpet when aleading member oftheRoyal
House wasabout todie(this actually happened, asI
was told, atLangat justbefore thedeath ofTungku

during myresidence intheneighbourhood). Then
oneRaja Bakar, sonofaRaja ‘Ali,during the re-
thatching ofthehouse atBandar, accidentally trod

anddied inconsequence ofhisinadvertence .When,
therefore, ahornet’s nestformed inside oneofthese

willingness which waspresently justified, astheChina-
man, too, after afewdays’ interval, swelled upand
died. Both these strange coincidences were readily
confirmed bythepresent Sultan onanoccasion
when Ihappened toquestion theauthenticity ofthe
story, and asHisHighness isoneofthemost en-
lightened andtruthful ofmen, such confirmation cannot
easily besetaside. Butthestrangest coincidence of

theopportunity ofasking whether there wasany

andasHisHighness notonlyvery obligingly assented,

theextent towhich certain portions ofthehuman frame
havecome tobeinvested with sanctity, andtorequire to

anatomy are, inparticular, thehead, thehair, theteeth,
theears,andthenails, allofwhich Iwilltake intheir
order.
Thehead, inthe firstplace, isundoubtedly stillcon-
sidered bytheMalays topossess some modified degree
ofsanctity. Aproof ofthis isthecustom i^adat) which
regulates theextent ofthesacrifice tobeoffered ina
case ofassault orbattery bytheparty committing
theinjury. Ifanypartofthehead isinjured, nothing
lessthanagoat willsuffice (theanimal being killed and

thebody, theslaughter ofacock (tobedisposed ofin
asimilar way) willbeheld tobesufficient reparation,
andsoon,thesacrifice becoming oflessvalue inpro-
portion astheinjured part isfarther from thehead.
So, too,Mr.Frazer writes: “The . . .superstition
(ofthesanctity ofthehead) existsamong theMalays;
foranearly traveller reports that inJavapeople‘wear
nothing ontheir heads, andsaythatnothing mustbeon
their heads, . . .and ifanyperson were toputhis

donotbuild houses with stories inorder thatthey

II THESOULOFMAN 47
(c)TheSoul
The Malay conception oftheHuman Soul
(Semangat)1isthat ofaspecies of“Thumbling,” “a
thin, unsubstantial human image,” ormannikin, which
istemporarily absent from thebody insleep, trance,
disease, andpermanently absent after death.
This mannikin, which isusually invisible but is
supposed tobeabout asbigasthethumb, corresponds
exactly inshape, proportion, andeven incomplexion, to
itsembodiment orcasing (sarong), z.e.thebody inwhich
ithas itsresidence. Itisofa“vapoury, shadowy, or
filmy” essence, though notsoimpalpable butthat itmay
cause displacement onentering aphysical object, and
asitcan“fly”or“flash ”quickly from place toplace,
itisoften, perhaps metaphorically, addressed asifit
were abird .2
Thus inacharm given intheAppendix wefind—
“Hither, Soul,come hither !
Hither, Little One,come hither!
Hither, Bird,come hither!
Hither, Filmy One,come hither!”3
Asthismannikin istheexact reproduction inevery
wayofitsbodily counterpart, and is“the cause oflife
andthought intheindividual itanimates,” itmayreadily
beendowed withquasi-human feelings, and“independ-
ently possess thepersonal consciousness andvolition of
1OrSuniangat. The derivation of
theword isunknown:possibly itmay
beconnected withsangat
,“excessive,”
orbangat,“sudden, quick.” The
meaning covers both“soul” and“life”
(i.e .notthestate ofbeing alive, butthe
cause thereof or“vital principle ”).
2Incalling the soul, aclucking
sound, represented inMalay bytheword kurorkerr,bywhich fowls are
called, isalmost always used;infact,
“kursemangat ”(“cluck! cluck!
soul !”)issuchacommon expression of
astonishment among theMalays that its
force islittlemore than“good gracious
me!”{vide infra,p.534, note).

itscorporeal owner.” Thus wefind thefollowing
appeal addressed tothesoul inthecharm just
quoted:—
“Do notbeargrudges,
Donotbear malice,
Donottake itasawrong,
Donottake itasatransgression.”
These quasi-human attributes ofthesoulbeing so
complete, itisaneasy stretch oftheimagination to
provide itwithahouse, which isgenerally inpractice
identified with thebody ofitsowner, butmay alsobe
identified with anyone ofitstemporary domiciles.
Thus inthecharm already quoted weread—
“Return toyourownHouse andHouse-ladder,
Toyourown House-floor, ofwhich theplanks have started,
Andyour Roof-thatch‘starred’with holes.”
The state ofdisrepair intowhich thesoul’s house
(i.e .thesickman’s body) isdescribed ashaving fallen,
ishere attributed tothe soul’s absence .1Thecom-
pleteness ofthis figurative identification ofthesoul’s
“house”with itsowner’s body, and ofthe soul’s
“sheath”orcasing with both, isvery clearly brought
outinthefollowing lines:—
“Cluck !cluck !Soul ofthissickman, So-and-so /
Return intotheFrame andBody ofSo-and-so,
ToyourownHouse andHouse-ladder, toyourownClearing and
Yard,
ToyourownParents, toyourownCasing.”
And this isnomere chance expression, forinanother
charm thesoul isadjured inthese words:—
1Inanother charm wefind thesickman’s body compared toaweather-
beaten barque atsea.


II CALLING THESOUL49
“Asyouremember yourown parents, remember me,
Asyouremember yourownHouse andHouse-ladder, remember
me.”1
Thesoul“appears tomen(bothwaking andasleep)
asaphantom separate from thebody ofwhich itbears
thelikeness,” “manifests physical power,” andwalks,
sits,andsleeps:—
“Cluck !cluck !Soul ofSo-and-so,come andwalk withme,
Come and sitwithme,
Come andsleep withme,andsharemypillow.”2
Itwould probably bewrong toassume thefore-
going expressions tohave always been merely figura-
tive. Rather, perhaps, weshould consider them aspart
ofasingularly complete andconsistent animistic system
formerly invented and stillheldbytheMalays. Again,
from theabove ideas itfollows that ifyou callasoul in
therightway itwillhearandobey you,andyou will
thusbeable either torecall toitsowners body asoul
which isescaping(riang semangat),ortoabduct the
soulofaperson whom youmaywish togetintoyour

such connection whatever. Andwhen youhave suc-
ceeded ingetting itintoyourpower theabducted and
nowimprisoned soul willnaturally enjoy any latitude

among theMalays agrees word forword

387,andhence Ihave nothesitated to
usehisexact words insofarasthey

Every man issupposed (itwould appear from
Malay charms) topossess seven souls2inall,or,per-
haps, Ishould more accurately say,asevenfold soul .3
This “septenity inunity”mayperhaps beheld toex-
plain theremarkable importance andpersistency ofthe
number seven inMalay magic, asforinstance the
seven twigs ofthebirch, andtheseven repetitions of

theseven nights’ duration oftheceremony, theseven

And, finally, itmight explain whythelime-branch
which ishung upinthemosquito-curtain (inanother
form ofsoul-abduction6
)isrequired topossess seven
fruits onasingle stalk, i.e.toensure there being a
separate receptacle foreachoneoftheseven souls.
Atthepresent daytheordinary Malay talks usually
ofonlyasingle soul, although he stillkeeps upthe
oldphraseology inhischarms andcharm-books. For
the rest, itwould appear that theremay besome

Now inall, Ibelieve, ofwhat arenow called the

States whatsoever, yellow isthe colour used by
royalty, whereas themore exalted andsacred colour,
white (with occasional lapses into yellow), hasbeen
adopted byMalay medicine-men asthecolour most
likely toconciliate the spirits anddemons withwhom
theyhave todeal. Thus thesoul-cloth, which, bythe
way, isalways fivecubits long (limahasta),issometimes

towhite, ofthecolour which ismostcomplimentary to

(d)Animal\Vegetable,andMineral Souls
Hitherto Ihave treated ofhuman souls only,
butanimal, mineral, andvegetable souls willnowbe
briefly discussed. Speaking generally, Ibelieve the
soul tobe,within certain limits, conceived asa
diminutive butexact counterpart of itsown em-
bodiment, sothatanAnimal-soul would belikean
animal, aBird-soul likeabird;however, lower inthe
scale ofcreation itwould appear that theTree- or
Ore-souls, forinstance, aresupposed, occasionally at
least, toassume theshape ofsome animal orbird.
Thus thesoulofEagle- wood isthought totake the
shape ofabird, thesoul ofTin-ore thatofabuffalo,
the Gold-soul that ofadeer .1Ithas,how-
ever, always been recognised that the soulmay
enter other bodies besides itsown, oreven bodies
ofadifferent kind to itsown, andhence these
may beonly apparent exceptions tothe rule that
thesoulshould bethecounterpart ofitsownembodi-
ment .2
“Among races within thelimits ofsavagery, the
general doctrine ofsouls isfound worked outwith
remarkable breadth and consistency. The souls of
animals arerecognised byanatural extension from
thetheory ofhuman souls;thesouls oftrees and
plants follow insome vague, partial way, andthe

casionally used forcertain decorative

souls ofinanimate objects expand thegeneral cate-
gory toitsextremest boundary.”1
TotheMalay whohasarrived attheidea ofa
generally animated Nature, buthasnotyetlearned to
draw scientific distinctions, there appears nothing
remarkable orunnatural intheideaofvegetation-souls,
oreven inthat ofmineral -souls—rather would he
consider usEuropeans illogical andinconsistent were
hetoldthatweallowed thepossession ofsouls toone
halfofthecreation anddenied ittotheother.
Realising this,weareprepared tofind that the
Malay theory ofAnimism embraces, atleast partially,
thehuman race,2animals3andbirds,4vegetation5(trees
and plants), reptiles and fishes,6until itsextension to
inert objects, such asminerals,7and“stocks andstones,
weapons, boats, food, clothes, ornaments, andother
objects, which tousarenotmerely soulless, but life-
less,” brings usface tofacewith aconception with
which “wearelesslikely tosympathise.”
Sidebysidewith thisgeneral conception ofanuni-
versally animate nature, wefindabundant evidences of
aspecial theory ofHuman Origin which isheld to
account notonly forthelarger mammals, butalso for
theexistence ofalargenumber ofbirds, andeven for
that ofafew reptiles, fishes, trees and plants, but

“The accredited intermediary between men and

great and traditional importance inaMalay village,
though inplaces neartowns theoffice isfalling into
abeyance. Inthe inland districts, however, the
Pawang isstill apower, and isregarded aspart
oftheconstituted order ofsociety, without whom no
village community would becomplete. Itmust be
clearly understood thathehasnothing whatever todo
with theofficial Muhammadan religion ofthemosque;
thevillage has itsregular staff ofelders—theImam,
Khatib, andBilal—forthemosque service. Butthe
Pawang isquite outside thissystem, andbelongs toa
different andmuch older order ofideas;hemaybe
regarded asthelegitimate representative oftheprimi-
tive‘medicine -man’or‘village -sorcerer,’ and his
very existence inthese days isananomaly, though it
does notstrike Malays assuch.

CHAP. Ill THEMALAYMAGICIAN 57
‘‘Very often theoffice ishereditary, oratleast the
appointment ispractically confined tothemembers of
one family. Sometimes itisendowed with certain
‘properties’handed down from onePawang tohis
successor, known asthekabesaran,or,as itwere,
regalia. Ononeoccasion Iwasnearly called upon to
decide whether these adjuncts—which consisted, in
thisparticular case, ofapeculiar kind ofhead-dress—
were thepersonal property oftheperson then inpos-
session ofthem(whohadgotthem from hisfather, a
deceased Pawang),orwere toberegarded asofficial
insignia descending with theoffice intheevent ofthe
natural heir declining toserve !Fortunately Iwas
spared thedifficult taskofdeciding thisdelicate point
oflaw,as Imanaged topersuade theowner totakeup
theappointment.
“Butquite apart from such external marks ofdig-
nity, thePawang isaperson ofvery real significance.
Inallagricultural operations, such assowing, reaping,
irrigation works, andtheclearing ofjungle forplant-
ing, infishing atsea, inprospecting forminerals, and
incases ofsickness, hisassistance isinvoked. He is
entitled bycustom tocertain small fees;thus, after a
good harvest he isallowed, insome villages, five
gantangs ofpadi,onegantang ofrice(beras),andtwo
chupaks ofemping (apreparation ofriceandcocoa-nut

After recovery from sickness hisremuneration isthe

some places towork intherice-field onthe14thand

idleness, being verycongenial totheMalay character,
is, Ibelieve, pretty strictly observed.
“Again, inreaping, certain instruments arepro-

cause ofbad harvests. Iwasaccordingly pressed to
fine transgressors, which would perhaps have been a
somewhat difficult thing todo.The fact,however,
that inmany places these rules aregenerally observed
isatribute totheinfluence ofthePawang wholends

“ThePawang keeps afamiliar spirit, which inhis
case isahantu piisaka,that is,anhereditary spirit
which runs inthefamily, invirtue ofwhich heisable
todealsummarily with thewild spirits ofanobnoxious
character.”2
The foregoing description issoprecise andclear
that Ihave notmuch toadd to it.There are,how-
ever,oneortwopoints which require emphasis. One
ofthese isthatthepriestly magician stands incertain
respects onthesame footing asthedivine man or
king—that istosay,heowns certain insignia which are
exactly analogous totheregalia ofthelatter, and are,

right tomake useofclothdyed with theroyal colour

“These kramats abound inMalacca territory
;there
ishardly avillage butcanboastsometwoorthree in
itsimmediate neighbourhood, andthey areperfectly
wellknown toalltheinhabitants.
“Theoretically, kramats aresupposed tobethe
graves ofdeceased holymen, theearly apostles ofthe
Muhammadan faith, the firstfounders ofthevillage
whocleared theprimeval jungle, orother persons of
local notoriety inaformer age;andthere isnodoubt
thatmany ofthem arethatandnothing more. But
even so,thereverence paid tothemandtheceremonies
thatareperformed atthem savour agood deal too
much ofancestor-worship tobeattributable toan
orthodox Muhammadan origin.
“Itiscertain, however, thatmany ofthese kramats
arenotgraves atall :many ofthem areinthejungle,
onhillsand ingroves, likethehigh places oftheOld
Testament idolatries;they contain notrace ofagrave
(while those that arefound invillages usually have
grave-stones), andthey appear tobereally ancient
sites ofaprimitive nature-worship ortheadoration of
thespirits ofnatural objects.
“Malays, when asked toaccount forthem, often
have recourse totheexplanations thatthey arekramat
jin,that is,“spirit ’’-places;and ifaMalay ispressed
onthepoint, andthinks that theorthodoxy ofthese
practices isbeing impugned, hewillsometimes addthat
the/m inquestion isajin islam,aMuhammadan and
quite orthodox spirit!
“Thus onBukit Nyalas, near theJohol frontier,
there isakramat consisting ofagroup ofgranite
boulders onaledge ofrockoverhanging asheer descent
ofagoodmany feet;bamboo clumps grow onthe
place, andthere were traces ofreligious riteshaving

Nakhoda Hussin, described asajin(oftheorthodox

People occasionally burned incense there toavert
drought andgetenough water forirrigating their
fields. There wasanother kramat ofhislowerdown
the hill, also consisting ofrocks, oneofwhich was
shaped something likeaboat. Iwasinformed that
thisjin isattended bytigers which guard the hill,and
arevery jealous oftheintrusion ofother tigers from
thesurrounding country. He isbelieved tohave
revealed himself totheoriginal Pawang ofthevillage,
themythical founder ofthekampong ofNyalas. Ina
case like this itseems probable thatthename attached

under athindisguise wehave here arelicofthewor-
ship ofthe spirit ofrivers and streams, asort of
elemental deity localised inthis particular place, and
stillregarded asaproper object ofworship andpro-
pitiation, inspite ofthetheoretically strictmonotheism
oftheMuhammadan creed. Again, atanother place
thekramat isnothing butatree,ofsomewhat singular

After explaining thedifference between beneficent
spirits andthespirits ofevil,Mr.Blagden continues :

Mr.George Bellamy, writing in1893, thusdescribed
the.kramat atTanjong Karang intheKuala Selangor

“Thekramat about which Iamnowwriting isa
veryremarkable one. Itissituated ontheextreme
point ofland atthemouth oftheriver Selangor, close
towhere thenew lighthouse hasbeen erected. A
magnificent kayu ara (akind offig-tree) forms a
prominent feature ofthetanjong (point orcape), and
atthebase ofthis tree, enveloped entirely by its
roots, isanoblong-shaped space having theappear-
ance ofaMalay grave, with theheadstones complete.
....Tothissacred spot constant pilgrimages are
made bytheMalays, andthelower branches ofthe
treerarely lackthose pieces ofwhite andyellow cloth
which arealways hung upasanindication thatsome
devout person haspaid hisvows. TheChinese also
have great respect forthiskramat,andhave erected
asortofsylvan temple atthefootofthetree.” Mr.
Bellamy tellshowoneRaja ‘Abdullah fell inlove
with amaiden named Miriam, whodisappeared and
wassupposed tohave been taken bythe spirits
(though shewas really carried offbyanearlier lover
named Hassan). Raja ‘Abdullah diedandwasburied
atthefootofthe fig-tree. Mr.Bellamy concludes :
“Ifyoueverhappen toseeavery bigcrocodile at

Abdullah.”1
InNo. 2ofthesame volume oftheSelangor
Journal Bellamy refers toanother kramat—thatof
’Toh Ketapang—which heappears tolocalise inUlu
Selangor.
Itisbynomeans necessary toensure thepopu-
larity ofakramat orshrine that thesaint towhose
memory itisdedicated should beaMalay. The
cosmopolitan character ofthese shrines isattested in
thefollowing notewhich Isent totheSelangor Jour-
nal2about theshrines intheUluLangat (Kajang)
district ofSelangor:—
“The chief kramats inthe district are‘Makam
’TohSayah’(thetomb ofaJavanese ofhigh repute);
‘Makam Said Idris,’ atRekoh, Said Idris being the
father ofthePenghulu ofCheras;‘Makam ’Toh
Janggut (a‘Kampar’ man), ontheroad toCheras;
and‘Makam ’TohGerdu orBerdu,’ atDusun Tua,
UluLangat. ’TohBerdu wasofSakai origin.”
Ihave never yet,however, heard ofanyshrine
being dedicated toaChinaman, and itisprobable
that thisspecies ofcanonisation isconfined (atleast
inmodern times) tolocal celebrities professing the
Muhammadan religion, aswould certainly bethecase
oftheMalays andJavanese mentioned inthe fore-
going paragraph, andquite possibly toointhecaseof
theSakai.
Itistrue thatChinese often worship atthese
shrines—just as,onthesame principle, theyemploy
Malay magicians inprospecting for tin;butthere
appear tobecertain limits beyond which they

cannot go,as itwas related tomewhen Iwas
living intheneighbourhood, that aChinaman who
had, intheinnocence ofhis heart, offered ata
Moslem shrine apiece oftheaccursed pork,was
pounced upon and slain before hereached home by
oneofthetigers which guarded theshrine.
Theshrine of’TohKamarong isoneofthemost
celebrated shrines intheLangat district, the saint’s
lastresting-place being guarded byawhite elephant
andawhite tiger, thelatter ofwhich hadbeen apet
(pemainan)ofhisduring hislifetime. Inthisrespect
itisexactly similar totheshrine of’Toh Parwi of
Pantei inSungei Ujong, which issimilarly guarded,
both shrines having been erected ontheseashore, itis
said, inthedayswhen theseacamemuch farther inland
than itdoes atpresent. Thefame of’TohKamarong
filled theneighbourhood, and itisrelated thaton
oneoccasion aniratemother exclaimed, ofasonof
herswhowasremarkable forhisvicious habits, “May
the’Toh Kramat Kamarong flyaway with him.”
Next daytheboydisappeared, and allsearch proved
fruitless, until three days later ’Toh Kamarong
appeared toher inadream, andinformed herthat
hehadcarried theboy off,asshehadinvited him to
do,and that ifshewere tolook forhisfootprints she
would beable todiscover them inside thepad-tracks
ofatigeroneofwhose feetwassmaller than therest,
andwhich wasthenhaunting thespot. Shedidso,
anddiscovered her son’s footprints exactly asthe
saint hadforetold. This Ghost-tiger, which nodoubt
must beidentified with’TohKamarong’s “pet,” used
toroam the district when Iwas stationed inthe
neighbourhood, andboth Iand, Ibelieve, thethen

smaller than therest. This curious feature isthought
bythelocalMalays atleast, tobeoneofthespeci-
allydistinctive marks ofarimau kramat,orGhost-
tiger, just asthepossession ofonetusk that is
smaller than theother isthemark ofaGhost-
elephant.1
Closely connected with thesubject ofshrines isthat
ofhigh places, such asthose spots where religious
penance was traditionally practised. One ofthese
sacred spots issaid tohave been situated upon
the“Mount Ophir” ofMalacca, which isabout 4000
feethigh, andonwhich acertain legendary Princess
known asTuan PutriGunong Ledang issaid tohave
dwelt, untilshetransferred herghostly court toJugra
Hill,upon thecoast ofSelangor.2
Such fasting-places areusually, asinJava, either
solitary hills orplaces which present some great
natural peculiarity;even remarkable trees androcks
being, ashasalready been pointed out,pressed into
theservice ofthisMalay “natural religion.”
(c)Nature ofRites
Themain divisions ofthemagico- religious cere-
monies oftheMalays areprayer, sacrifice, lustration,
fasting, divination, andpossession.

foranything butpersonal advantages ofamaterial
character being ever, sofaras Iamaware, preferred
bytheworshipper. The efficacy ofprayer is,how-
ever, often supposed tobeenhanced byrepetition.
“Asprayer isarequest made toadeity asifhe
were aman, sosacrifice isagiftmade toadeity as
ifhewere aman The ruder conception
that thedeity takes andvalues theoffering for itself,
gives place, ontheonehand, totheidea ofmere
homage asexpressed byagift,and,ontheother, to
thenegative view thatthevirtue liesintheworshipper
depriving himself ofsomething prized.”1
Ageneral survey ofthecharms andceremonies
brought together inthisvolume will, Ithink, belikely
toestablish theview that theMalays (inaccordance
with thereported practice ofmany other races) prob-
ablycommenced with the idea ofsacrifice asa
simple gift,andtherefrom developed first theidea
ofceremonial homage, and later theidea ofsacrifice
asanactofabnegation. Evidences oftheoriginal
gift-theory chiefly survive inthelanguage ofcharms,
inwhich thedeity appealed toisrepeatedly invited
toeatanddrink oftheofferings placed before him,
asamaster maybeinvited toeatbyhisservants.
The intermediate stage between thegiftandhomage
theories ismarked byanextensive useof“sub-
stitutes,” andofthe sacrifice ofapart orparts for
thewhole. Thusweeven find thedough model
ofahuman being actually called “the substitute”
(tukar ganti), and offered uptothespirits upon the
sacrificial tray;inthesame sense arethesignificant
directions ofamagician, that “ifthespirit craves a
human victim acockmay besubstituted ,”and the

Ill RITESANDSACRIFICES 73
custom ofhunters who,when theyhave killed adeer,
leave behind them intheforest small portions ofeach
ofthemore important members ofthedeers anatomy,
as“representatives” oftheentire carcase. Inthis last
case theusual “ritualistic change maybetraced from
practical reality toformal ceremony.” “The originally
valuable offering iscompromised forasmaller tribute
oracheaper substitute, dwindling atlasttoamere
trifling token orsymbol.”1
Thishomage -theory will, Ibelieve, befound to
cover byfarthegreater bulk ofthesacrifices usually
offered byMalays, andtheideaofabnegation appears
tobepractically confined tovotal ceremonies orvows
(niat),inwhich thenature andextent oftheoffering
arenotregulated bycustom, butdepend entirely upon
thewealth orcaprice oftheworshipper, there being
merely atacit understanding thatheshall sacrifice
something which isofmore than nominal value to
himself.
Ofthemanner inwhich offerings aresupposed to
bereceived bythedeity towhom they areoffered
itisdifficult toobtain verymuch evidence. Ihave,
however, frequently questioned Malays upon thissub-
ject,andonthewhole think itcanvery safely besaid
that thedeity isnotsupposed totouch thesolid or
material partoftheoffering, butonlytheessential part,
whether itbe“life,savour, essence, quality”oreven
the“soul.”
Itwillperhaps beadvisable, inorder toavoid repe-
tition, todescribe afewofthespecial anddistinctive
sub-rites which form partofmany ofthemore import-
antceremonies, such as(inparticular), ritesperformed

Ofthe rites performed atshrines, Mr.Blagden
says :“Theworship there, aswithmost other kramats,
consists oftheburning ofincense, theoffering ofnasi

noticed anumber oflivepigeons there which illustrate
thepractice, common inBuddhist countries, ofreleas-
ingananimal inorder togain ‘merit’ thereby.” At
ashrine ontheLangat river Ihave seen fowls which
had (Iwastold)been similarly released.
Mr.Blagden’s remarks apply with equal force to
theservices performed attheshrines ofSelangor, and
Ibelieve alsoofother States. Itshould, however,
Ithink, bepointed outthat thenasikunyit (yellow
rice) is,usually atallevents, eaten bythosewhotake
part intheservice. Ataceremony which washeldon
oneoccasion aftermyrecovery from sickness, and in
which, byrequest, Itook part,1incense was burnt,

father ofthepresent Sultan ofSelangor), andtheparty
thenadjourned toashelter some twenty orthirty yards
lowerdown the hill,where, firstthemen,andthen the
women and children, partook ofthe flesh ofthe

hepresently did. These Bilals areneedy menand

thought therewasnoreason whythesaint should not
contribute something tohissupport.
Theburning ofincense isoneofthevery simplest,
and hence commonest, forms ofburnt sacrifice.
Some magicians saythat itshould beaccompanied by
aninvocation addressed totheSpirit ofIncense, which
should bebesought, asintheexample quoted below, to
“pervade theseven tiersofearthandskyrespectively.”
Itwould appear thattheintention oftheworshipper is
toensure that his“sacrifice ofsweet savour”should
reach thenostrils ofthegods andhelp topropitiate
them, wherever theymay be,bymeans ofaforetaste
ofofferings tofollow. This invocation, however, is
notunfrequently omitted, oratleast slurred overby
theworshipper, inspite ofthecontention ofthemagi-
cianswho use it,that “without itthe spell merely
rises likesmoke which isblown away bythewind.”
The following isoneform oftheinvocation in
question:—

The direction taken bythefumes oftheincense is
observed andnoted forthepurpose ofdivination;
this feature ofthe rite willbenoticed under the

Another form ofsacrifice consists inthescattering
ofrice.The sacrificial rice(Oryza saliva) used inthe
ceremonies isalways ofthefollowing kinds :firstly,
parched rice(b'ras bertiJi);secondly, washed rice
{Uras baso/i)
;thirdly, saffron-stained rice {b'ras
kunyit,i.e.ricestained with turmeric);
2and, finally,
aspecial kind ofglutinous rice called pulut {Oryza
glutinosa),which isalsovery generally used forsacri-
ficial banquets.
Ofthese, theparched rice isgenerally used for
strewing thebottom ofthe sacrificial tray {anchak)
when theframework hasbeen covered withbanana
leaves, buttheofferings have notyetbeen deposited
within it.
Thewashed and saffron ricearegenerally used
forscattering either over thepersons tobebenefited
bytheceremony, orelseupon theground orhouse-
floor.

purpose, ithasbeen suggested thattherice isintended

inachemical sense, i.e.inthesense of“sterilising”
theactive element ofpoisons, orofdestroying the
active potentialities ofevil spirits.
The rite itself consists intheapplication1ofathin

Ill FASTING ANDPENANCE 81
Short rhyming charms arevery often used as
accompaniments ofthe riteofrice-water, butappear
tobeseldom ifeverrepeated aloud. Thefollowing isa
specimen, andothers willbefound intheAppendix r1—
“Neutralising Rice-paste, true Rice-paste,
And, thirdly, Rice-paste ofKadangsa !
Keepmefrom sickness, keepmefrom death,
Keepmefrom injury andruin.”
Other notlessimportant developments oftheidea
oflustration bywater aretobefound insuch cere-
monies asthebathing ofmother and child after a
birth andthewashing ofthefloor (basoh lantei) upon
similar occasions, thebathing ofthesick, ofbride and
bridegroom atweddings, ofcorpses(meruang),2and
theannual bathing expeditions (mandi Safar), which
aresupposed topurify thepersons ofthebathers and
toprotect them from evil (tolak bala).
Fasting, ortheperformance ofreligious penance,
which isnowbutseldom practised, would appear to
have been only undertaken informer days with a
definite object inview, such astheproduction ofthe
state ofmental exaltation which induces ecstatic visions,
theacquisition ofsupernatural powers(sakti),andso
forth.
The fastalways took place, ofcourse, inasolitary
spot,andnotunfrequently upon thetopofsome high
andsolitary hillsuch asMount Ophir (Gunong Led-
ang),ontheborders ofMalacca territory. Frequently,
however, much lower hills, oreven plains which pos-
sessed some remarkable rockortree,would beselected

isstilloneofthetraditions ofthatneighbourhood,
whilst inMalay romances and inMalay tradition this
form ofreligious penance isfrequently represented as
continuing foryears.
Finally, Iwould draw attention tothestrong vein
ofSympathetic Magic or“make believe”which runs
through andleavens thewhole system ofMalay super-
stition. The root-idea ofthisform ofmagic hasbeen
said tobetheprinciple that “cause follows from effect.”
“Oneoftheprinciples ofsympathetic magic isthat
any effectmaybeproduced byimitating it.... Ifit
iswished tokillaperson, animage ofhim ismade
andthendestroyed;and itisbelieved thatthrough a
certain physical sympathy between theperson andhis
image, theman feels theinjuries done totheimage as
iftheyweredone tohisownbody, andthatwhen itis
destroyed hemust simultaneously perish.”2
The principle thus described isperhaps themost
important ofallthose which underlie the“Black Art”
oftheMalays.

CHAPTER IV
TheMalay Pantheon

Acareful investigation ofthemagic ritesandcharms
usedbyanation which haschanged itsreligion will
notunfrequently show, thatwhat isgenerally called
witchcraft ismerely theddbris oftheolder ritual, con-
demned bythepriests ofthenewer faith, butyet
stubbornly, though secretly, persisting, through the
unconquerable religious conservatism ofthemass of
thepeople.
“There isnothing thatclings longer toaracethan
the religious faith inwhich ithasbeen nurtured.
Indeed, itisimpossible foranymind that isnot
thoroughly scientific tocast offentirely thereligious
forms ofthought inwhich ithasgrown tomaturity.
Hence inevery people thathasreceived theimpression
offoreign beliefs, wefind thatthelatter donotexpel

easily abandoned than ideas, andevenwhen allthe
external forms ofthealien faithhavebeen puton,and
fewvestiges oftheindigenous oneremain, thelatter
still retains itsvitality inthemind, andpowerfully
colours orcorrupts theformer. The actual religion of


84 THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
apeople isthus ofgreat ethnographic interest, and
demands aminute andsearching observation. No
other facts relating torude tribes aremore difficult of
ascertainment, ormore often elude inquiry.”1
“The general principle stated byLogan inthe
passage justquoted receives remarkable illustration
from aclose investigation ofthefolk-lore andsuper-
stitious beliefs oftheMalays. Two successive religious
changes have taken placeamong them, andwhenwe
havesucceeded inidentifying thevestiges ofBrahman-
ismwhich underlie theexternal forms ofthe faith of
Muhammad, long established inallMalay kingdoms,
weareonlyhalf-way through ourtask.
“There yetremain thepowerful influences ofthe
stillearlier indigenous faith tobenoted andaccounted
for. Just astheBuddhists ofCeylon turn intimes of
sickness anddanger, nottotheconsolations offered by
thecreed ofBuddha, buttothepropitiation ofthe
demons feared andreverenced bytheir early pro-
genitors, andjustastheBurmese andTalaings, though
Buddhists, retain infullforce thewhole oftheNat
superstition, soamong theMalays, inspite ofcenturies
which have passed since theestablishment ofanalien
worship, theMuhammadan peasant may befound
invoking theprotection ofHindu gods against the
spirits ofevilwithwhich hisprimitive faith haspeopled
allnatural objects.”2

evidence tolead tothebelief that itwasaform of

IV HINDU ANDMALAYDIVINITIES 85
The evidence offolk-lore, taken inconjunc-
tion with that supplied bycharm -books and
romances, goes toshow that thegreater gods ofthe
Malay Pantheon, though modified insome respects
byMalay ideas, were really borrowed Hindu divinities,
andthatonly thelesser godsand spirits arenative to
theMalay religious system. Itistruethatsome of
these native gods canbewithmore orlessdistinctness
identified withthegreat powers ofnature :theKing of
theWinds (Raja Angin) forinstance;“Mambang Tali
Harus,” orthegodofmid-currents (theMalay Nep-
tune);thegods ofthunder andlightning, oftheceles-
tialbodies, etc.;butnone ofthem appear tohave the
status ofthechiefgods oftheHindu system, andboth
bylandandwater theterrible Shiva (“Batara Guru”
or“Kala”) issupreme. Yeteach department of
nature, however small, has itsown particular godling
orspiritwho requires propitiation, and influences for
good orevilevery human action. Only themoral
element iswanting tothedivine hegemony—the
“cockeyed,” limping substitute which does duty for
itreflecting only tootruthfully thecharacter ofthe
people withwhom itpasses asdivine.
Iwill first take, indetail, thegods ofHindu origin.
“Batara (orBetara) Guru” is“thename bywhich
Siva isknown tohisworshippers, who constitute the
vast majority oftheBalinese, andwhoprobably con-
stituted thebulk oftheoldJavanese.”1
Inthemagic ofthePeninsular Malays wefind
Vishnu thePreserver, Brahma theCreator, Batara
Guru, Kala, and S’risimultaneously appealed tobythe
Malay magician
;andthough itwould, perhaps, berash,
1Mr.R.J.Wilkinson inJ.R.A.S.yS.B.,No.30,p.308.


86 THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
(asMr.Wilkinson says), toinfer solely fromMalay
romances orMalay theatrical invocations (many of
which owemuch toJavanese influence), thatHinduism
was themore ancient religion oftheMalays, there
isplenty ofother evidence toprove thatthe“Batara
Guru”oftheMalays (nolessthan theBatara Guru of
BaliandJava) isnone other than therecognised father
oftheHindu Trinity .1
Ofthegreater deities orgods, Batara Guru is
unquestionably thegreatest. “In theHikayat Sang
Samba (theMalay version oftheBhaumakavya),
Batara Guru appears asasupreme God, withBrahma
andVishnu assubordinate deities. ItisBatara Guru
whoalone hasthewater oflife(ayerutama(atama)

spiritwho held theplace ofAllah before theadvent
ofMuhammadanism, aspirit sopowerful thathecould
restore thedead tolife;and tohim allprayers were
addressed.”
Mr.Wilkinson, inthearticle fromwhich wehave
already quoted, deals with another point ofinterest,
theexpression sang-yang,orbatara,which ispre-
fixed toguru. After pointing outthatyang in
thiscase isnottheordinary Malay pronoun(yang,
who), butanoldword meaning a“deity,” he
remarks, thatsofarashehasbeen able todiscover,
itisonlyused ofthegreater Hindu divinities, and
notofinferior deities ordemi-gods. Thuswefind
itapplied toShiva andVishnu, butnever tothe
monkey -god Hanuman, oradeity ofsecondary
importance likeDermadewa. Such inferior divinities
have only the lesser honorific “sang ”prefixed to
their names, and inthisrespect farenobetter than
mere mortals (such asSang Sapurba andSang Ran-
junaTapa) andanimals (such as, infables, Sang
Kanchil, Mr.Mousedeer;andSang Tikus, Mr.
Rat).
“The expression batara isalso limited tothe
greater Hindu divinities (except when used asa
royal title), eg.Batara Guru, Batara Kala, Batara
Indra, Batara Bisnu, etc. Thus the expressions
sang-yang andbatara are fairly coincident intheir
application .1But there areafew deities ofwhom

sang-yang tunggal, ‘theonlyGod,’ sang-yang sokma, etc.
“Thus batara would seem tobelimited inuseto
theactual names ofHindu deities asdistinct from
epithets describing those deities. “Batara Guru”
would seem tobeanexception—theonlyone—to
this rule,and topoint tothe fact that theoriginal
meaning ofguru hadbeen lostsight of,andthatthe
expression hadcome toberegarded only asaproper
name.”
Occasionally, as isonly tobeexpected, the
Malays getmixed intheir mythology, andofthis
Mr.Wilkinson gives twoexamples, oneoftheiden-
tification ofBatara Guru (Shiva) withBrahma (Berah-
mana), andanother ofthedrawing ofadistinction
between “Guru” (Shiva) and “Mahadewa,” which
latter isonlyanother name forthesame divinity.
Such slips areinevitable among anilliterate people,
andshould always becriticised bycomparison with
the original Hindu tenets, from which these ideas

taken ascorrect. And inany case
itsuse incombination withguru
appears towarrant itsclassification
with the titles applied tothegreater
deities. It isalso, however, used,
like sang,ofinferior deities and
even ofanimals {e.g. ina“Spectre
Huntsman” charm) wefind“Lansat,
sa-raja anjing,etc.” Dewa isused
indiscriminately (occasionally incon-
junction withmambang)both ofthe
greater and lesser divinities. Thuswe
notunfrequently findsuch expressions
asDewa Bisnu {i.e. Vishnu), dewa
mambang,dewa danmambang,etc.;
andweareexpressly told that they
(theDewas) “are socalled because
they areimmortal.” Mambang (per se)
issaid tobesimilarly used, notonly of
greater {videApp. xvii.), butoflesser
divinities, and“Mambang TaliHams,”god ofmid-currents, haseven been
explained asreferring toBatara Guru
(Shiva). This, however, isnodoubt
aninstance ofconfusion, asitgenerally
appears tobeusedwith the“colour”

usually assigned totheinferior divini-
ties;and,moreover, inaninvocation
addressed tothesea-spirit, the‘
‘godof

which appears tobemerely another
name forBatara Guru, thereason given
forthepreferment ofthisrequest being
thatheisinthehabit of“visiting the
Heart oftheSeas” inwhich ’Toh
Rimpun ‘Alam dwells (the titleofthe
latter being perhaps taken from the
tree,Pauh Janggi),


IV ICALAAND S’Rl 89
Mr.Wilkinson quotes anextraordinary genealogy
representing, inter alia,“Guru astheactual father
oftheHindu Trinity,” andalsoof“Sambu” (whom
hecannot identify), and “Seri, who istheHindu
Sri, thegoddess ofgrain, and, therefore, adeity
ofimmense importance totheoldJavanese and
Malays.”
On this Iwould onlyremark thatSambu (or
Jambu) isthe first portion ofthename almost uni-
versally ascribed totheCrocodile-spirit bythePen-
insular Malays .1
Itwould bebeyond thescope ofthiswork to
attempt theidentification ofBatara Guru (Shiva) with
allthenumerous manifestations and titles attributed
tohimbytheMalays, butthespecial manifestation
(ofShiva), which iscalled “Kala,” forms anintegral
part ofthegeneral conception, whether among the
1Footnote supra. Sambu (Sambhu,
theAuspicious One) ismerely another
name forShiva (rarely ofBrahma),
and itsapplication tothecrocodile-
spiritwould appear toindicate that this
latter was, formerly, atleast, regarded
asanembodiment ofthat supreme
god’s manifestation asawater -god.
Itisworth while tocompare thiswith
theexpression “’Toh Panjang Kuku,”
which isapplied tothecorresponding
manifestation ofthesupreme godon
land, andwhich strongly suggests the
tiger.
“Most ofthetheological words ofthis
list[printed inApp. xiv.] areSans-
krit,andafford proof sufficient, ifany
were needed, oftheformer prevalence
oftheHindu religion among theMalays
and Javanese. Many ofthem are
more orlesscorrupted inorthography,
owing tothedefective pronunciation
and defective alphabets oftheArchi-
pelago. Some, also, arealtered or
varied insense. Tapas,‘ascetic de-
votion,’ isdeprived ofitslastconson-antandbecomes tapa. Avatar,‘a

andinstead ofimplying thedescent or

Malays orHindus, and is,therefore, deserving of
some attention.
TheMalay conception ofBatara Guru seems to
have been thathehadboth agood andabadside
tohischaracter. Though hewas“Destroyer” he
was also “Restorer-to-life ,”1and itwould appear
that these twoopposite manifestations ofhispower
tended todevelop intotwo distinct personalities,
adevelopment which apparently wasnever entirely
consummated. This, however, isnot the only
difficulty, foroninvestigating the limits ofthe
respective spheres ofinfluence ofBatara Guru and
Kala, wefind that theonly sphere, which isalways
admitted tobeunder Kala’s influence, istheinter-
mediate zonebetween therespective spheres ofinflu-
ence ofBatara Guru (ashe iscalled ifonland, “Si
Raya”ifatsea)andathird divinity, whogoesby
thename of“’Toh Panjang Kuku,” or“Grandsire
Long-Claws.”
NowHindu mythology, weare told,knows next
tonothing ofthesea,andanysuch attempt asthis
todefine therespective boundaries ofseaandland
isalmost certain tobedue totheinfluence ofMalay
ideas. Again, theintermediate zone isnotneces-
sarily considered lessdangerous than thatofdefinitely
evil influences. Thus themost dangerous time for
children tobeabroad issunset, thehourwhenwe
can “call itneither perfect daynornight”; so
tooadayofmingled rainandsunshine isregarded
asfraught with peculiar dangers from evil spirits, and
itwould bequite inkeeping withsuch ideas thatthe
intermediate zone, whether between high andlow
water-mark, orbetween theclearing andprimeval

forest, should beassigned toKala, theDestroyer.
Inwhich case theexpression “Grandsire Long-
Claws” might beused tosignify this special mani-
festation ofShiva onland, possibly through the
personality oftheTiger, just astheCrocodile -spirit
appears torepresent Shiva bywater .1
Wethusreach apoint ofexceptional interest, for
hunting, being among theoldHindus oneofthe
seven deadly sins,wasregarded asalowpursuit, and
onewhich would never beindulged inbyagod. Yet
Iwasrepeatedly toldwhen collecting charms about
theSpectre Huntsman thathewas agod, and, ex-
plicitly, thathewasBatara Guru. This shows the
strength oftheMalay influences which hadbeen at
work, andwhich had actually succeeded incorrupting
thecharacter, sotospeak, ofthesupreme godofthis
borrowed Hindu Trinity .2
The Batara Guru ofthe Sea,who bysome
magicians, atallevents, isidentified with SiRaya
(the“Great One”), and,probably wrongly, with the
God ofMid-currents3(Mambang Tali Harus), isofa
much milder character than histerrestrial namesake or
compeer, andalthough sickness maysometimes be

This isdone “inorder toputoutthebrightness,” the
reason that itmust beputoutbeing that inthecase
ofanyonewho isnotvery strong (lemah semangat)
itcauses fever.
(b)Spirits,Demons,andGhosts
The“Jins” or“Genii,” generally speaking, form
avery extensive class ofquite subordinate divinities,
godlings, orspirits, whose place inMalay mythology
isclearly due,whether directly orindirectly, toMuham-
madan influences, butwhomaybemost conveniently
treated here asaffording asort ofconnecting link
between godsandghosts. There has, itwould appear,
been astrong tendency onthepart oftheMalays to
identify these imported spirits with thespirits oftheir
older (Hindu) religion, buttheonlyGenie who really
rises tothelevel ofoneofthegreatHindu divinities
istheBlack King oftheGenii (Sang Gala1Raja, or
Sa-Raja Jin),whoappears attimes amanifestation of
Shiva Batara Guru,who isconfounded with thede-
structive sideofShiva, i.e.Kala. This atleastwould
appear tobetheonlytheory onwhichwecould explain
theuseofmany oftheepithets orattributes assigned
totheKing oftheGenii, who isatonetime called
“the oneandonlyGod”; atanother, “Bentara {i.e.

and atanother, “theLand Demon, theBlack Batara

Thefollowing isadescription ofthis,themightiest
oftheGenii:—

Black Heart andBlack Lungs,
Black Spleen andtusk-like Teeth,
Scarlet Breast andbody-hairs inverted,
Andwith onlyasingle bone .1

obtainable, thespirit thusdescribed isidentifiable wfith
theBlack King ofGenii, who dwells intheHeart
oftheEarth, andwhose bride, SangGadin (orGading),
presented himwithseven strapping Black Genii as
children .2
Altogether there areonehundred andninety of
these (Black?) Genii—more strictly, perhaps, onehun-
dredandninety-three, which coincides curiously with
thenumber of“Mischiefs” (Badi), which reside in
“all living things.” The resemblance, Imay add,
does notendhere;forthough theGeniimaydogood,
andthe“Badi” donot,both areconsidered able to
doinfinite harm tomortals, andbothmake choice of
thesame kind ofdwelling-places, such ashollows in
the hills, solitary patches ofprimeval forest, dead
parasites ontrees, etc. etc.

Ujan,” which may possibly bePersia);1other
magicians, however, variously derive them from the
dissolution ofvarious parts oftheanatomy ofthegreat
snake “Sakatimuna,” ofthe“First Great Failure”
tomake man’s image (atthecreation ofman);from
thedrops ofblood which spirted uptoheaven when
the first twins, Abel andCain (intheMalay version
Habil and Kabil) bittheir thumbs;from thebig
cocoa-nut monkey orbaboon (berok besar),andsoon.
Thetheory already mentioned, viz.that theBlack
King oftheGenii gradually came tobeidentified with
Kala, andlatercame gradually tobeestablished asa
separate personality, appears tobetheonlyonewhich
will satisfactorily explain therelations subsisting be-
tween theBlack andWhite Genii, whoareontheone
hand distinctly declared tobebrothers, whilst the
White Genie isinanother passage declared tobe
Maharaja Dewa orMahadewa, which latter is,aswe
have already seen, aspecial name ofShiva.
ThisWhite Genie issaid tohave sprung, byone
account, from theblood-drops which fellontheground
when Habil andKabil bittheirthumbs;byanother,
from theirises ofthesnake Sakatimuna’s eyes (benih
mataSakatimuna),and issometimes confused with the
White Divinity (’TohMambang Puteh), who lives in
thesun.

taken inference fromsome expression

tosome Arabic authorities, being theFather oftheGenii, or,according to
others, aparticular class ofthemwho
arecapable ofbeing transformed into
“Jin.” VideHughes, Diet, ofIslam,

canfindout, isrecorded ofhim,he is,ontheother hand,

Avery curious subdivision ofGenii into Faithful
(JinIslam) and Infidel (Jin Kafir) isoccasionally met
with,and itissaid, moreover, thatGenii (itistobe
hoped orthodox ones)may besometimes bought at
Mecca from the“Sheikh Jin”(Headman ofGenii) at
prices varying from$90to$100 apiece.2
1Perhaps acorruption ofSartan,
theCrab (Cancer) intheZodiac.
2The following account ofGenii
(printed intheSelangor Journal,vol. i.
No.7,p.102)wasgivenmebyaMecca
pilgrim or“Haji.” Thismanwasa
native ofJavawhohadspent several
years intheMalay Peninsula, and as
Mecca isthegoal ofthepilgrimage to
allgoodMuhammadans alike, itis
important toknow something ofthe
ideaswhich arethere disseminated, and
withwhich theMalay pilgrim would
belikely tocome incontact. “In
theunseen world theplace offirst
importance must beaccorded, on
account oftheirimmense numbers, to
the‘Jins’ (the‘Genii’ oftheArabian
Nights).”
“TheJavanese, drawing aslightly
stronger line ofdistinction (than that
ofgoodandbad genii intheArabian
Nights),callthesetwo(separate) classes
theJinIslam andtheJinKafir, orthe
Faithful andtheInfidel. Ofthesetwo
classes, theformer shrink from what-
ever isunclean, andthelatter only will
approach theChinese, towhom the
JinIslam manifests thestrongest re-
pugnance. Thegood genii areperfectly
formed inthefashion ofaman, butare,
ofcourse, impalpable asair,though
theyhaveavoice like mortals. They
live inamosque oftheirown,whichtheynever leave, andwhere they offer
upunceasing prayers. Thismosque is
built ofstone, andstands beside alake
called‘Kolam Yamani ’;into this
lake thewhole ofthewaters from the
neighbouring country drain, and the
overflow runsdown tothe sea. In
thislake thegood genii bathe, and if
anywicked orchildless mortals bathe
in itthey carry them offand detain
them inthemosque until they (the
mortals) have shown proof oftheir
reformed character bycontinuing fora
long while without committing awrong
action, when they aresentback in
safety totheir native land. Ishould
add that theJinIslam exact tribute
from theunfaithful—
e.g.Chinamen—
and iftheydonotreceive their due,
they will steal itandgive ittoason
ofIslam. [Theymaybebought from
the“Sheikh Jin”atMecca forprices
varying from$90 to$100 each.]
“The JinKafir, orbad genii, are
invariably deformed, their heads being
always outoftheir proper position;in
short, they areOthello’s
Menwhose heads
Dogrowbeneath their shoulders.
Their commonest name, ‘Jin isi-isi
didalam Dunia’(the Geniiwho Fill
theWorld), isowing tothe factthat
theirenormous numbers fillthewhole
atmosphere from earth tosky. Like


IV JINANDJ&MBALANG 97
Besides these subdivisions, certain Genii aresome-
times specifically connected with special objects or
ideas. Thus there aretheGenii oftheroyal musical
instruments (Jin Nemfiri, orLempiri, Gendang, and
Naubat), whoaresometimes identified with theGenii
oftheState (Jin Karaja’an), and theGenii ofthe
Royal Weapons (JinSembuana), both ofwhich classes
ofGenii areheld able tostrikemen dead. The only
other Genie that Iwould here specially mention is
theJin ‘Afrit (sometimes called Jin Rafrit), from
whom the“White Man ”(adesignation which is
often specially used inthePeninsula asasynonym
forEnglishman) issometimes said tohave sprung, but
who belongs inArabian mythology toahigher class
than themere Genii. Before leaving thesubject of
Genii, Imust, however, point out theextremely
common juxtaposition oftheArabic word “Jin” and
theMalay “Jembalang.” From thefrequency with
which thisjuxtaposition occurs, andfrom the factthat
thetwoappear tobeused largely asconvertible terms,
wemight expect tofindthat JinandJembalang were
mere synonyms, both applicable tosimilar classes of
spirits. Theprocess isnotquite complete, however, as
although theexpression Jembalang Tunggal (theonly
Jembalang), isfound aswellasJinTunggal, thehigher
thegood Genii, theycannot diebefore
thegreat dayofjudgment, but(unlike
them) they aredumb.
*iGreat astheirnumbers aretheyare
continually increasing, asthey are

and theirwhole time isspent inworks

bytheangels atthebidding ofGod to
cool theparched verdure, they will
assemble their legions, bringing withthem invisible cocoa-nut shells, onefor

and trees alike wither forlack of

wroth, castthunderbolts uponthem out

thunderbolts blast intheir fall. At

98 THEMALA YPANTHEON CHAP.
honorific Sang Raja orSa-Raja isnever, sofarasIam
aware, prefixed totheword “Jembalang,” though itis
frequently prefixed to“Jin.” Oftheother members
oftheMalay hierarchy whoowe their introduction to
Muhammadan influences, theonlyones ofimportance
areangels (Mala’ikat), prophets (Nabi), andheadmen
(Sheikh).
Iwilltakethem inthisorder.
Oftheangels, unquestionably themost important
areAzrael (‘Azra’il or‘Ijrail), Michael (Mika’il), Israfel
(Israfil, Ijrafil, orSerafil), and Gabriel (Jibra’il or
’Jabra’il, often corrupted intoRaja Brahil). There
canbenodoubt that theforegoing aremeant for
thenames ofagroup offour archangels, thename
ofIsrafel corresponding toAbdiel, who generally
occupies thefourth place inourown angelic hierarchy.
Their customary duties areapportioned among the
fourgreat angels asfollows:—
Azrael is,aswith us,theangel ofdeath, who
“carries offthelives ofallcreatures”;Israfel is“lord
ofallthedifferent airs”inourbody;Michael isthe
“giver ofdaily bread ”
;andGabriel isamessenger
or“bringer ofnews.”
Sometimes, again, aWhite Angel (Mala’ikat Puteh)
ismentioned, egasbeing in“charge ofallthings
inthejungle,” butwhat his specific duties are in
thisconnection does nottranspire.
Inaninvocation addressed tothe Sea-spirit, how-
ever,wefindfourmore such angels mentioned, allof
whom hold similar charges:—
Chitar Ali istheangel’s name, who islordofthewhirlpool;
Sabur Ali istheangel’s name, who islordofthewinds;
SirAli istheangel's name, who islordofthewaters ofthesea;
Putar Ali istheangel’s name, who islordoftherainbow.


IV ANGELS ANDPROPHETS 99
Nodoubt thenames ofmany more ofthesub-
ordinate angels might becollected, aswearerepeatedly
toldthatthey areforty-four innumber.
Oftheprophets (Nabi) there areanindefinite
number, the titlebeing applied tomany ofthemore
prominent characters who figure inourownOld
Testament (aswell asintheKoran), butwhowould
notbyourselves beconsidered topossess anyspecial
qualifications forprophetic office. Among themore
famous ofthese Imaymention (afterMuhammad and
hisimmediate compeers) theprophet Solomon (some-
times considered—nodoubt owing tohisunrivalled
reputation formagical skill—astheking oftheGenii,
whose assistance thehunter ortrapper iscontinu-
allyinvoking)
;theprophet David, celebrated for
thebeauty ofhisvoice; andtheprophet Joseph,
celebrated forthebeauty ofhiscountenance. Besides
these (and others ofthesame type), there isagroup
ofminor prophets whose assistance iscontinually in-
voked incharms;these aretheprophet Tap(Tetap
orKetap?), “lord oftheearth;” theprophet Khailir
(Khaithir orKhizr), “lord ofwater;” theprophet
Noah, “lordoftrees;”andtheprophet Elias, “planter
oftrees.”
Khizr isoften confounded with Elias. He dis-
covered anddrank ofthefountain oflife(whence his
connection with water), and willconsequently notdie
tillthelasttrump.
Next totheprophets comes the“Sultan” (Sultan),
or“King” (Malik), both ofwhich Arabic titles,
however, aresomewhat rarely used byMalay
magicians. Stillwefindsuch expressions asSa-
Raja (Sang- Raja?) Malik (King ofKings) applied to
Batara Guru.


IOO THEMALAYPANTHEON CHAP.
Next tothese royal honorifics comes the titleof
“Headman”or“Sheikh.”
There are, itisusually stated, fourofthese Sheikhs
who are“penned”(di-kandang)intheFour Corners
oftheEarth respectively, andwhose names are‘Abdul
Kadir, ‘Abdul Muri, athirdwhose name isnotmen-
tioned, and‘Abdul ‘Ali.1
Sometimes they arecalled “Sheikh ‘Alam ”(orSi
Putar ‘Alam), andareeach said toreside “within aring-
fence ofwhite iron.” Hence weobtain aperfectly
intelligible meaning fortheexpression, “Askpardon of
theFour Corners oftheWorld” i.e.oftheSheikhs
who reside therein, though thephrase sounds ridi-
culous enough without such explanation.
Theonlyother Arabic titlewhich isperhaps worth
noticing here2isthatof“Priest ”(Imam), which we
findsomewhat curiously used inaninvocation addressed
tothesea-spirit. “ImamAnJalii isthename ofthe
‘Priest oftheSeal”
Intheinvocation addressed totheSea-spirit we
findtheexpression:—
“Jungle-chief oftheWorld isthename oftheOld
Man oftheSea.”
There can,however, belittledoubt that this“Old
Man oftheSea” isameresynonym forBatara Guru.
Asetofexpressions towhich special reference
should perhaps bemade consists ofthe titles used
bythewild jungle tribes (Sakais), theuseofwhich

“Autochthones”aremore influential with the

1.WINDANDWEATHER CHARMS
Not theleastimportant attribute oftheMalay magi-
cian informer dayswas hispower ofcontrolling the
weather—apower ofwhich Malay magic incantations
stillpreserve remarkable traces.
Thuswhen thewind failsandthe sails ofaboat
areflapping (kalau layer k!lepek-fc lepek), aSelangor
magician would notunfrequently summon thewind in
thefollowing terms:—
“Come hither, Sir,come hither,myLord,
Letdown your locks solongandflowing.”
And ifthewind iscontrary hewould say:—
“Veer round, Wind, aneedle ortwain (ofthecompass),
Aneedle to(letme)fetchKapar A
However heavy themerchandise that Icarry unassisted,
Letmerepair toKlang forthe(morning) meal,
AndLangat forthe(evening) bathe.

io8 AIR CHAP.
Come hither, Sir,come hither,myLord,
And letdown your locks solongandflowing.”
Again, ifthewindgrew violent hewould say:—
“Eggs oftheHouse-lizard, Eggs oftheGrass-lizard,
Make atriowithEggs oftheTortoise.
Iplant thispolethus inthemid-stream
(That) Wind andTempest maycome tonaught.
LettheWhite (ones) turn intoChalk,
And theBlack (one) intoCharcoal .1
Sometimes themagician willfasten arice-spoon
(ichemcka)2horizontally tothemast ofthevessel, and
repeat some suchcharm asthefollowing:—
“The bird ‘Anggau-anggau5flies
Toperch onthehouse ofMalim Palita.
Mayyoudieasyou lean,mayyoudiefrom apush,
Mayyoudiebythis‘sending’of1Prince Rice-spoon’s.’”3
Ofrain-making ceremonies inSelangor therenow
remains little buttradition. YetaLangat Malay told
methat ifaMalay woman putsupon herhead an
inverted4earthenware pan {i?langa), andthen, setting
itupon theground, fills itwithwater andwashes the

heavy rain willcertainly ensue .5

2.BIRDS ANDBIRDCHARMS
Thechief features oftheBird-lore ofthePeninsular
Malays, which, aswillappear inthecourse ofthis
chapter, isstrongly tinged with animism, have been
thusdescribed bySirWilliam Maxwell:—
“Ideas ofvarious characters areassociated by
Malays with birds ofdifferent kinds, andmany of
their favourite similes arefurnished bythefeathered
world. The peacock strutting inthejungle, the
argus pheasant calling onthemountain peak, thehoot
oftheowl,and thecryofthenight-jar, have all
suggested comparisons ofvarious kinds, which are
embodied intheproverbs ofthepeople .4TheMalay
1Themeranti isafinehard-wood
forest tree.
2i.e.“Maywebewell sheltered.”
3Vide p.93,supra.
4Theproverbs referred toaretobe
found inthe collections ofproverbs
sentbyMr.Maxwell toNos. 1,2,
and 3oftheJournal oftheStraits
Branch oftheRoyal Asiatic Society.
Thenumbers areconsecutive.
4.Apaguna-nia merak mengigal di
hutan ?
“What istheuseofthepeacock
strutting inthejungle ?”The idea isthat thebeauty ofthe
bird isthrown awaywhen exhibited in
alonely spotwhere there isnone to
admire it.
72.Seperti ponggok merindu bulan.
“Astheowlsighs longingly tothe
moon.”
Afigure often used byMalays in
describing thelonging ofalover for
his mistress. Itrecalls aline in
Gray’s “Elegy,” “The moping owl
doth tothemoon complain.” [Asto

drawn fromsuch sources, aregenerally justandoften
poetical.
“The supernatural birdGerda (Garuda, theeagle of
Vishnu), who figures frequently inMalay romances, is
dimly known totheMalay peasant. If,during the
day, thesun issuddenly overcast byclouds and
shadow succeeds tobrilliancy, thePerak Malay will
say“Gerda isspreading outhiswings todry.”1Tales
are told, too,ofother fabulous birds2—thejintayu,
which isnever seen, though itsnote isheard, and
which announces theapproach ofrain;3and the
chandrawasi,which hasnofeet. Thechandrawasi

73.Seperti kuang mekik di-puchuk

“Like theargus pheasant calling on

Another poetical simile foracomplain-
inglover. Here heiscompared toa

93.Seperti tetegok di-rumah tinggal.
“Like thenight-jar atadeserted

intheMalay Peninsula, whose habits
arenocturnal and solitary. Ithasa

phrase isused tosignify thesolitude
andloneliness ofastranger inaMalay

Elsewhere (in notes afterwards
published intheSelangor Journal)
(vol. i.No. 23, p.360) SirW.E.
Maxwell says“Theburong tetegok is
notanight bird, but fliesbyday. It
canbedistinguished byitsshort rapid
note,which resembles tegok-tegok-tegok-

identifies thisbirdwiththeMalay night-
jar (Caprimulgus macrurus. Horsf.)
described byCapt. Kelham, inNo. 9,page122oftheJ.R.A.S.yS.B. None
oftheDutch Dictionaries identify it
clearly, though Klinkert (probably
wrongly) identifies itwith thesmall

“Thelegend oftheSpectre Huntsman isthus told
bythePerak Malays:—
“Informer days, atKatapang, inSumatra, there

seized withaviolent longing forthemeat ofthepelan-
dok(mouse-deer). But itwasnoordinary pelandok
thatshewanted. Sheinsisted that itshould beadoe,

quest was fruitless, forhehadmisunderstood hiswife’s
injunctions, andwhat hesought wasabuckpelandok,

connection withthebirds withwhich the
Malays associate him.Theexplanation
towhich Irefer istobefound inProf.
Newton’s Dictionary ofBirds (1893),
subvoce “Gabble-ratchet.” Iquote
inextenso :—
“Inmany parts ofEngland, but
especially inYorkshire, the cries of
some kind ofwild goose,1when flying
bynight, areheard with dismay by
thosewhodonotknow thecause of
them, andareattributed to‘Gabriel’s
Hounds,’ anexpression equivalent to
‘Gabble -ratchet,’ aterm often used
forthem, asinthissense gabble issaid
tobeacorruption ofGabriel,and that,
according tosome mediaeval glossaries,
isconnected withgabbara orgabares,a
word meaning acorpse (cp.Way,
Promptorhim Parvulorum,p.320,
sub voce*Lyche ’);while ratchet is
undoubtedly thesame astheAnglo-
Saxon rceceandMiddle English racche
orrache,adogthathunts byscentand

would originally mean‘corpse-

man. . . .Thesounds are attimes
verymarvellous, nottosayimpressive,
when heard, asthey almost invariablyare,onapitch-dark night, and ithas
more than once happened within the
writer’s knowledge that aflock of
geese, giving utterance tothem, has
continued forsome hours tocircle over
atown orvillage insuch away asto
attract theattention ofthemost un-
observant ofitsinhabitants, andinspire
with terror those among themwho are
prone tosuperstition. (Cp.Atkinson,

notes proceeding from aflock ofthis species
curiously resemble thesound ofhounds infull

some hearers liken them totheyelping of
puppies. Thediscrepancy may tosome extent
depend ondistance.”
2Possibly thesounds made bythegeese
might beattributed tothenight -jarby
peasants through the latter’s appearing atthe
timetheywere made. Itiscurious that the
Malays aswellshould connect thenight-jar
with theWildHuntsman.

bear strong andunmistakable family likeness. Still

Astillmore curious deviation occurs inanother
version,3where theSpectre Huntsman’s poniard and
k'ris aredeclared tobetheinsignia ofthegreat
Spirit- KingRama. Thepassage isasfollows:—

apassage below, which runs:—
“OSiAdunada, with thesword slung atyour back,

This reference toRama opens upalong vista of
possibilities, butforthepresent itwillbesufficient to
remark thattheSpectre Huntsman himself isalmost
universally declared bytheMalays tobetheKing

account ofthiskingship that hisweapons receive
distinguishing titles such asaregiven toroyal
weapons. This, too, isthereason thathe issomuch
more dreaded byMalays than ordinary spirits ofevil;
hismere touch being considered sufficient tokill,by
theexercise ofthat divine power which allMalay
Rajas areheld topossess.1
Toreturn from theforegoing digression :there are
many other curious legends connected with Birds.
Thus, in1882, Captain Kelham wrote asfollows:—

the-way village on the Selangor
coast, where three subordinate officers
oftheGovernment (foremen ofworks)

V LEGENDS ABOUT BIRDS 121
“From Mr.W.E.Maxwell, H.M. Assistant Resi-
dent, ofLarut, Ihear thattheMalays have astrange
legend connected withoneofthelarge Hornbills; but
which species Iwasnotable tofind out. Itisasfol-
lows:—
“‘AMalay, inorder toberevenged onhismother-
in-law (why, thelegend does not relate), shouldered
hisaxeandmade hisway tothepoorwoman’s house,
andbegan tocutthrough theposts which supported it.
After afewsteady chops thewhole edifice came
tumbling down, andhegreeted itsfallwith apealof
laughter. Topunish him forhisunnatural conduct he
wasturned intoabird,andthetebang mentuah (liter-
ally,Hewhochopped down hismother-in-law) may
often beheard inthejungle uttering aseries ofsharp
sounds likethechop ofanaxeontimber, followed by
Ha! ha!ha!’” 1
Thefollowing account ofthebird-lore oftheMalay
Peninsula wascompiled bymefrom notes supplied
totheSelangor Journal2bythe late SirWilliam
Maxwell:—
TheNight-jar (Burong cheroh?) takes itsname from
theword applied tothesecond stage intheoperation
ofhusking rice. Malay women husk ricebypounding
itinamortar with awooden pestle. Thehusked
grain isthencommonly winnowed inasieve, and

Captain H.R.Kelham, whoadds :—
“Iasked Mr.Low,H.B.M. Resi-
dent ofPerak, ifhecould givemeany
information astowhich species of
Hornbill thislegend relates to,andhe
writes—
“‘Itisthelargest Hornbill which is
found inPerak, bigger, Ishould say,
than theRhinoceros Hornbill, but I

theunhusked rice
(antah)which remains hastobe
separated from thehusked riceandpounded over
again. Thesecond process, which iscalled cheroh,
isthatfrom which thenight -jarderives itsname,
thequick fancy oftheMalay hearing inthenote
ofthebird theslowmeasured stroke ofapestle
{antan)descending inamortar(lesong ).This is
possibly thefoundation ofthelegend that theNight-
jar isawoman who, while engaged inhusking rice
bymoonlight, wasturned intoabird inconsequence
ofaquarrel with hermother. Another name for
thenight-jar isburong chempak.
TheBurong sepahputri (“Princess’s betel-quid”)
belongs totheHoney-birds orBee-eaters, ofwhich
there areseveral species, remarkable chiefly fortheir
brilliant metallic plumage. [Aquaint story istold in
explanation ofitsname :onceupon atime theOwl
(ponggok)
fellinlovewith thePrincess oftheMoon
(Putri Bulan) andasked her tomarry him. She
promised todoso,ifhewould allow her first tofinish
herquid ofbetel undisturbed;butbefore finishing it
shethrew itdown totheearth, where ittook theform
ofthesmall bird inquestion. The Princess then
requested theOwl tomake search for it,but as,of
course, hewasunable tofind it,theproposed match
fellthrough. This isthereason why theOwl, to
quote theMalay proverb, “sighs longingly tothe
Moon,” and isthetype oftheplaintive lover.1

’Tokkatampi (“Old-man-winnow- the-rice-for-the-

)is
aspecies ofhorned owl,which derives itsname from a
word meaning towinnow(tampi,menampi). Malays
saythat this birdhasahabit oftreading upon the
extremities ofitsownwings, and fluttering theupper
part while thus holding them down. This singular
habit produces asound resembling thatofwinnowing.
The’Tohkatampi islarger than theJampuk ,
another species ofowl,which ispopularly supposed
toenter thefowl-house andthere liveontheintestines
offowls, which itextracts during lifebymeans ofa
certain charm i^elmu pelali, acharm similar tothose
used bytheMalays for filing teeth, etc.)which it
uses inorder toperform theoperation painlessly.
The “Luck-bird ”(.Burong untong) isavery small
white birdabout the sizeofacanary. Itbuilds a
very small white nest, which iffound andplaced in
arice-bin possesses thevaluable property ofsecuring
agood harvest toitsowner. As,however, thenest

say, turn toalivid colour whenever thewearer is

bytheapproach ofpoison .1
TheMerbu (?merbok)isavariety ofDove which
brings good luck toitsowner. Instances have been
known where allthehouses inavillage have been

treatises have been written onthesubject ofkeeping
them. When themerbu dies itsbody merely shrivels

The bird called Pedrudang isadiver which has

TotheGround-pigeon(Tekukur)belongs the fol-
lowing story:—“Once upon atime there was a
maiden who lived intheforest with herparents and
little sister. When shegrew upshewas troubled
byananxiety toaccompany her father inhisex-
peditions tothe forest, where hewasengaged in
clearing theground forarice -plantation. Her
parents, however, persuaded her tostay athome;
first until thetrees were felled, then until thefallen
timber hadbeen burnt off,then tillthericehadbeen
planted, and then again till itwas cut. When,
however, they attempted toputher offyetonce
more, until the rice should betrodden out, she
could bear itnolonger, andtaking offherbracelets
and earrings, which she leftbehind thedoor, and
placing her little sister intheswinging -cot,she
changed herself intoaground-dove andflewaway to
theclearing. [She retained hernecklace, however,
and thisaccounts forthespeckled marks onthis
doves neck.] Onarriving atthespotwhere her
parents were engaged atwork, shealighted ona
dead treestump(changgong),and called outthrice to
hermother,‘Mother, mother, Ihave leftmyearrings
and bracelets behind thedoor, andhave putmy little
sister intheswing.’ Her mother, amazed atthese
words, hastened home, andfound herdaughter gone.
Shethen returned tothe bird, which repeated the
same words asbefore, this time, however, concluding
with thecooofadove. Invain thedistressed
parents endeavoured torecapture her,bycutting
down the treeonwhich shehadperched;before

they haddone soshe flew toanother, and after
following herfrom tree totree forseveral miles
they were obliged todesist, and shewas never
recaptured.”1
The following notes onbirds aretaken from a
reprint2of“Museum Notes” byMr.L.Wray, jun.,
theofficial curator ofthePerak Museum. Mr.Wray
says:—
“TheWeaver-bird, which makes thelonghanging
bottle -shaped nests occasionally seen hanging from
thebranches ofalow tree, issaid touseagolden
needle inthework;and itisaffirmed that ifthe
nest iscarefully picked topieces, without breaking
anypart of it,theneedle willbefound;but ifitis
pulled ruthlessly apart, orifeven asingle piece of
thegrass ofwhich itismade isbroken inunravelling
it,thegolden needle willdisappear. Themakers of
these curious and beautiful nests aresaid toalways
choose trees that areinfested with redantsorwasps,
orwhich grow inimpassable swamps.”
TheWeaver-bird (Ploceus Bay a,Blyth) iscalled
(inSelangor) Burong Tempua orChiak Raya. Itis
said touseonly thelong jungle grass called lalang
formaking itsnest,which latter iscalled buahrabun,
and isused bytheMalays forpolishing sheaths
and scabbards. When aninfant keeps crying,
one oftheparents takes theweaver- bird’s nest,
reduces ittoashes, andfumigates thechild bythrice
moving itround inacircle over thesmoke. Whilst
doing so,theparent either stands upwith theright

upon the leftheel,bending theright knee, andsaying,
‘Astheweaver-bird’s young initsnest, sorestand

(Bagimana anaktempua dalam sarang-nya,
bagitu-lah ’kaudiam jangan menangis). Tothe
above Imayadd that besides theordinary bottle-
shaped nest, theweaver-birds also occasionally make
ahood-shaped, orrather ahelmet-shaped nest,which
isalleged bytheMalays tobethemale bird’s
‘swing’(buayan ).This ‘swing’ resembles theupper
halfofanordinary bottle-shaped nest, with aperch
across it,which latter isalsowoven ofgrass. On
thewalls oftheswing, justover each end ofthe
perch, isasmall daub ofclay. TheMalays allege
that themale birdswings in itwhile thehen bird
issitting, and that theyoung too‘take the air’ in
itassoon asthey areable toflysofar. Into the
twodaubs ofmudover theperch themale bird (say
theMalays) sticks fire-flies togive itself light at

“The Burong demam,or‘Fever bird,’ issocalled
from itsloud, tremulous note, andtheMalays say
thatthefemale bird calls initsfever-stricken voice to
itsmate togoand find food, because ithasfever so
badly that itcannot go itself. This bird isprobably
oneofthelarge green barbets. The note isoften
heard, anddoubtless thebirdhasbeen collected, but it
isonething shooting abirdandanother identifying it

“Another bird, theWhite-breasted Water-hen, a

Fowling Ceremonies
Ideas ofsympathetic magic runvery strongly
through allceremonies connected with thetaking of
wild birds, such forinstance asjungle-fowl orpigeon.
Thecommonest method ofsnaring jungle-fowl is
totake aline(called rachik),with agreatnumber of
finenooses attached to it,and set itsoastoform a
complete circle, enclosing anopen space intheforest.
Youmust bring adecoy-bird with you,andthe in-
structions which Icollected saythatyoushould on
arriving enter thecircle, holding thebird likeafight-
ingcockyandrepeat these lines:—
“Ho, SiLanang, SiTempawi,
Come and letusplay atcock-fighting
Ontheborder-line between theprimary andsecondary
forest-growth.
Your cock, Grandsire, isspurred with steely
Mine isbutspurred withbamboo.”
Here deposit thebirdupon theground. The chal-
lenge ofthedecoy-bird willthen attract thejungle-
fowlfrom alldirections, and asthey trytoenter the
circle (inorder toreach thedecoy), they willentangle
themselves inthenooses.
Asoften asyousucceed, however, incatching one,
youmustbecareful tocastthe“mischief” outofit,
using thesame form ofwords asisused todrive the
“mischief” outofthecarcase ofthedeer.
Themethod ofcatching wildpigeon ismuch more
elaborate, andbrings theanimistic ideas oftheMalays
intostrong relief, the“souls”ofthewildpigeon being
repeatedly referred to.

“Wak-wak [stands for]aheron onthekitchen shelf,
Covered over with thetopofacocoa-nut shell,
Doyoumove aside, SirBachelor, Master oftheCeremonies,

Now thatyouunderstand theprocess ofdecoying
pigeon with apigeon-call, Imust explain something of
thecurious nomenclature usedbythewizard;fordur-
ingtheceremony youmust never callaspade aspade.
Inthe first place, thehutmust notonanyaccount be
mentioned assuch :itistobecalled theMagic Prince—whysocalled, itishard tosay,butmost likely the
name isused inallusion tothewizard who isconcealed
inside it.Thename given tothecalling-tube itself is
more appropriate, asitiscalled “Prince Distraction”
(Raja Gila), thisname ofcourse being anallusion
totheextraordinary fascination which itevidently
exercises onthepigeon. Then thedecoy (orrather,
perhaps, therod towhich itislinked) iscalled
Piitri Pemonggo’, ortheSquatting Princess. Next
tothese come three Princesses which prove to
bemerely the representatives ofthree important
species ofwild pigeon. Their names, though
variously given, areperhaps mostcommonly known
asPrincess “Kapor,” Princess “Sarap,” andPrincess
“Puding.”
Finally, even therodused forensnaring thepigeon
has itsown special name, SiRaja Nyila (Prince In-
vitation).
“King Solomon’s necklaces” andarmlets areof
course thenooses withwhich they aretobesnared,
andwhich willcatch them either bytheneck orby
theleg.
The Princesses areinvited toenter agorgeous
palace:—


40 BIRDSANDBIRDCHARMS CHAP.
“Come down, pigeons, inyour myriads,
Andperch upon theiIvory Hall,’
(That is)carpeted with silver, andrailed withamalgam,
(Come down) tothedishes ofHerHighness Princess Lebar
Nyiru (Broad-sieve).”1
The “dishes ofHerHighness Princess Broad-
sieve”cleverly suggest anabundance ofprovender
such asislikely toappeal toahungry bird!
Inanother version thethree Princesses are in-
vited toenter the“Palace Tower” called “Fatimah
Passes” (Mahaligei Fatimah Lalu).
Moreover those who issue theinvitation areno
respecters ofpersons:—
“Letthose which arenear, arrive the first,
Letthose which arefaroffbesent for,
Letthose which have eggs, leave their eggs,
Those which have young, leave their young,
Those which areblind, beledbyothers,
Those which havebroken limbs, come oncrutches;
Come andassemble inKing Solomon’s Audience-Chamber.”2
Andasimilar passage inanother charm says—
“Letthose which arenear, arrive the first,
Letthose which arefaroffbesent for,
Cluck !cluck !souls ofthechildren offorest doves,
Come yedown andassemble together
InthefoldofGodandKing Solomon.”
Ifblandishments fail,however, there istobeno
doubt about thepunishments instore fortheir wilful
Highnesses :thus, alittle later,wefindthealternative,
athoroughgoing imprecation calculated to“convince”
themost headstrong ofbirds:—

Andanimprecation ofsimilar import says—

Ifyouperch onacreeper, you shall slide off it,

I.BUILDING CEREMONIES ANDCHARMS
The firstoperation inbuilding istheselection of
the site. This isdetermined byanelaborate code of
rules which make thechoice depend—firstly, upon
thenature ofthesoilwith respect tocolour, taste, and
smell;secondly, upon theformation ofitssurface
;and,
thirdly, upon itsaspect:—
“Thebest soil,whether forahouse, village, orchard,
ortown, isagreenish yellow, fragrant-scented, tart-
tasting loam :suchasoilwillensure abundance ofgold
and silver unto thethird generation .1
“The best site, whether forahouse, village,
orchard, ortown, islevel .2
“The best aspect (ofthesurface) isthatofland
which islowupon thenorth sideandhighupon the
south side :such asite willbring absolute peace-
fulness.”3

142 EARTH CHAP.
When youhave found asitecomplying withmore
orlessfavourable conditions, inaccordance with the
code, youmust next clear theground offorest or
undergrowth, laydown four sticks toform arect-
angle inthecentre thereof, and callupon thename
ofthelords ofthatspot (i.e.thepresiding local deities
orspirits). Now digupthesoil(enclosed bythefour
sticks), andtaking aclod inyour hand, callupon the
lords ofthatspot asfollows:—
“Ho,children ofMentri1Guru,
Who dwell intheFour Corners oftheWorld,
Icrave thisplotasaboon.”
(Here mention thepurpose towhich youwish toput it.)
“Ifitisgood, showmeagoodomen,
Ifitisbad,showmeabadomen.”2
Wrap theclodupinwhite cloth, and after fumi-
gating itwith incense, place itatnight beneath your
pillow, andwhen you retire torestrepeat the lasttwo
lines oftheabove charm asbefore andgotosleep.
Ifyourdream isgood proceed with, ifbad desist
from, your operations. Supposing yourdream tobe
“good,” youmust (approximately) clear the siteof
themain building andpegoutthefourcorners with
dead sticks;then take adead branch andheap it
uplightly with earth (inthecentre ofthe site ?) ;set
firetoit,andwhen thewhole heap hasbeen reduced
toashes, sweep italluptogether andcover itover
while yourepeat thecharm (which differs but little
from thatgiven above). Next morning uncover it
early inthemorning andGod willshowyouthegood
andthebad.

orBatara, Guru (i.e. Shiva), which is
whatweshould here expect (vide thecharms afew pages farther on).
“Mentri” usually means “minister.”

V ERECTING THECENTRE-POST 43
The sitebeing finally selected, youmust proceed
tochoose adayforerecting thecentral house-post, by
consulting first theschedule oflucky andunlucky
months, andnext theschedule oflucky andunlucky
days oftheweek .1
[The besttimeofdayfortheoperation totakeplace
issaid tobealways seven o’clock inthemorning.
Hence thereseems tobenoneed toconsult aschedule
todiscover it,though some magicians maydoso.]
The propitious moment having been atlastascer-
tained, theerection ofthecentre-post willbeproceeded
with. First, thehole for itsreception must bedug
(theoperation being accompanied bythe recital ofa
charm) andthepost erected, thegreatest precautions
being taken toprevent theshadow ofanyofthe
workers from falling either upon thepost itself orupon
theholedug toreceive it,sickness andtrouble being
otherwise sure tofollow .2
[The account intheAppendix, ofwhich theabove
isardsumd, omits todescribe thesacrifice which has
tobemade before theerection ofthecentre-post, which
hastherefore beendrawn from theinstructions ofother
magicians.]
“When theholehasbeendugandbefore thecentre-
post isactually erected, some sortofsacrifice oroffer-
inghastobemade. Firstyoutakealittle brazilwood

post torestupon(buat lapik tiang srt). Putaring
onyour little finger outofcompliment totheearth-
spirit(akan membujok jembalang itu),repeat the
charm1anderect thepost.”2
Another form oftheabove ceremony wasdescribed
tomebyamagician asfollows:—
“Deposit intheholealittle scrap-iron and tin-ore,
acandle nut(buah k'ras orbuah goi'ek)}abroken
hatchet head (Uliong patcih),andacent (incopper).
Wait tilleverybody else hasreturned home, and,
standing close tothehole, pickupthree clods(kepal)
ofearth, holdthem(,genggam)over theincense, turn
‘right-about-face’andrepeat thecharm .3Then take
thethree clodshome (without once turning round to
lookbehind you tillyoureach home), placethem under
your sleeping pillow andwait tillnightfall, when you
mayhave either agood orabaddream. Ifthe first
night’s dream bebad,throw away oneoftheclods
anddream again. Ifthesecond night’s dream be

2Analternative method was thus
described tomebyamagician :Take
awhite cup, fill itwith water, fumigate
itwith incense, and deposit itinthe
hole dug toreceive thecentre-post.
Early nextmorning take note ofit;if
itisstill fullofwater, itisagood sign;
ifthewater haswasted (susut), abad
one. Iflive insects arefound in it,
itisagood sign, ifdead ones, bad.
There can,however, be little doubt
thattheoriginal victim ofthis sacrifice
wasahuman victim (generally perhaps
aslave), forwhom the buffalo wassubstituted (the goat, fowl, andegg
representing further successive stages
inthedepreciation oftherite). Malays
ontheSelangor coast more thanonce
toldmetheyhadheard thattheGovern-
ment was inthehabit ofburying a
human head under thefoundations of
anyunusually large structure (e.g. a
bridge), andtwo cases where alocal
scare resulted from theprevalence of
this ideawere recorded inthelocal
press (theMalay Mail) in1897.

bad,repeat theprocess, andwhenever yougetagood
dream deposit theclod orclods under thebutt-end
ofthecentre-post toserve asafoundation.”
Amagician gavemethisspecimen ofacharm
used atthisceremony (oferecting thecentre-post):—
“Ho,Raja Guru, Maharaja Guru,
You arethesons ofBatara Guru.
Iknow theorigin fromwhich youspring,
From theFlashing ofLightning’s spurs;
Iknow theorigin fromwhich you spring,
From theBrightening ofDaybreak.
Ho,Spectre oftheEarth, Brains oftheEarth, Demon ofthe
Earth,
Retire yehence tothedepths oftheOcean,
Tothepeace oftheprimeval forest.
Betwixt youandme
Division wasmade byAdam.”
Another rule ofimportance inhouse-building is
thatwhich regulates thelength ofthethreshold, as
towhich theinstructions areasfollows:—
“Measure off(onapiece ofstring) thestretch
(fathom) ofthearms ofherwho istobemistress of
theproposed house. Fold this string inthree and
cutoffone third. Take theremainder, fold itineight
andcutoffseven-eighths. Take theremaining eighth,
seehowmany times itiscontained inthelength of
thethreshold, andcheck offthenumber (ofthese
measurements) against the“category” (bilangan) of
the“eight beasts”1(benatang yang (Tlapan). This
category runs asfollows:—(1)Thedragon(naga);(2)
thedairy-cow (sapi)
;(3)thelion(singa)
;(4)thedog
(anjing)
;(5)thedraught-cow (lembu);(6)theass

tions. Ifthe lastmeasurement coincides withoneof
theunlucky beasts inthecategory, such asthecrow
(which signifies thedeath ofthemaster ofthehouse),
thethreshold iscutshorter tomake itfitinwithone
that ismore auspicious.”1
Thenames ofthe“eight beasts,” coupled with the
events which they aresupposed toforeshadow, are
oftencommemorated inrhyming stanzas.
Here isaspecimen:—
I.—TheDragon (naga).
“Adragon ofbulk, amonster dragon,
Isthisdragon thatturns round month bymonth .2
Wherever yougoyou willbesafefrom stumbling-blocks,
And allwhomeetyou willbeyour friends.”
II.—TheDairy-Cow (sapi).
“There isthesmoke ofafireintheforest,
Where Inche ‘Ali isburning lime;
They were milking theyoung dairy-cow,
And inthemidst ofthemilking itsprawled and felldown

III.—TheLion (singa).
“Alionofcourage, alionofvalour,
Istheliongambolling attheendofthePoint.
Theluck ofthishouse willbelasting,
Bringing youprosperity from year toyear.”
IV.—TheDog (anjing).
“Thewild dog, thejackal,
Barks atthedeerfrom night tonight;
Whatever youdowillbeastumbling-block;
Inthishousemen willstaboneanother.”
1Another form ofmeasurement was
from thethreshold (ofthefront door)
totheendofthehouse;but the
method ofaugury inthis cas'? isnot
yetquite clear.2Thisprobably refers tothemystic
Dragon which does duty (inMalay
charm-books) asan“aspect compass.”
Vide Chap. VI. p.561, infra,and
App. cclvii.

V.—TheDraught- Cow(lembu).
“The bigcowfrom themiddle oftheclearing

Great good luck willbeyour portion,
Never willyoucease tobeprosperous.”
VI.—TheAss (kaldei).
“The asswithin theFort

VII.—TheElephant (gajah).
“The bigriding elephant oftheSultan

VIII.—TheCrow (gagak).
“Ablack crow soaring bynight

Great indeed isthecalamity which hashappened:
Within thehouse itsmaster liesdead.”
Inclose connection with theceremonies forthe
selection ofindividual house sites aretheforms by
which theprinces ofMalay tradition selected sites
forthetowns which they founded. The following
extract will perhaps convey some idea oftheir
character :—
“OnedayRajaMarong Maha Podisat went into
hisouter audience hall, where allhis ministers,
warriors, and officers were inattendance, andcom-
manded thefourMantris toequip anexpedition
with allthenecessary officers andarmed men, and
with horses andelephants, arms andaccoutrements.
The fourMantris didastheywere ordered, andwhen


148 BUILDING CEREMONIES CHAP.
allwasready they informed theRaja. The latter
waited foralucky dayandanauspicious moment,
andthen desired hissecond son tosetout.The
Prince took leave after saluting hisfather andmother,
and alltheministers, officers, andwarriors who fol-
lowed him performed obeisance before the Raja.
They then setout insearch ofaplace ofsettlement,
directing their course between south and east, intend-
ingtoselect aplace withgood soil,andthere tobuild
atown with fort, moat, palace, and balei} They
amused themselves inevery forest, wood, andthicket
through which they passed, crossing numbers ofhills
andmountains, andstopping hereandthere tohunt
wild beasts, ortofish iftheyhappened tofallinwith
apool orlake.
“After theyhadpursued their quest forsome
time theycame tothetributary ofalarge river
which flowed down tothe sea. Farther onthey
came toalarge sheet ofwater, inthemidst ofwhich
were four islands. The Prince wasmuch pleased
with theappearance oftheislands, andstraightway
took asilver arrow and fitted ittohisbownamed
Indra Sakti, and said :‘Oarrow ofthebowIndra

wherever thou mayest chance to fall, there will I
make apalace inwhich tolive.’Hethendrew his

sight again, and fellupon oneofthe islands, which
onthataccount was called Pulau Indra Sakti. On
that spotwaserected atown with fort, palace, and

baleiyand allthepeople whowere living scattered
about inthevicinity were collected together and set
towork onthevarious buildings.”1
Even inthemaking ofroads through the
forest itwould appear that sacrificial ceremonies
arenot invariably neglected. Ononeoccasion I
came upon aparty ofMalays intheLabu jungle
whowere engaged inmaking abridle-track forthe
Selangor Government. Asmall bamboo censer, on
which incense hadbeen burning, hadbeen erected

2.BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS
Allwild animals, more especially thelarger and
more dangerous species, arecredited inMalay folk-
lorewithhuman or(occasionally) superhuman powers.
Inthepages which nowfollow Ishall dealwith the
folklore which refers tothemore important animals,
firstpointing outtheir anthropomorphic traits, then
detailing some ofthemore important traditions
about them, and finally, where possible, describing the
methods ofhunting them.

them which have been inherited from theprimitive
tribes ofEastern Asia. Muhammadanism hasnot
been able tostamp outthedeep-rooted feelings which
prompted thesavage toinvest thewild beasts which
hedreaded with thecharacter ofmalignant deities.
The tiger, elephant, andrhinoceros1were notmere
brutes tobeattacked anddestroyed. Theimmense
advantages which their strength andbulkgavethem
over thefeebly-armed savage ofthemost primitive
tribes naturally suggested thepossession ofsuper-
natural powers;and propitiation, not force, wasthe
system bywhich itwashoped torepel them. The
Malay addresses thetiger asDatok (grandfather), and
believes thatmany tigers areinhabited byhuman
souls. Though hereduces theelephant tosubjection,
anduseshim asabeast ofburden, itisuniversally
believed thattheobservance ofparticular ceremonies,
andtherepetition ofprescribed formulas, arenecessary
before wild elephants canbeentrapped andtamed.
Some ofthese spells andcharms(mantra)aresupposed
tohave extraordinary potency, and Ihave inmy
possession acurious collection ofthem, regarding
which, itwas toldmeseriously byaMalay, that in
consequence oftheir being read aloud inhishouse

todevise theidea ofinfluencing himbyinvocations.
This idea isinherited, bothbyMalays andSiamese,
fromcommon ancestry.”1
Totheabove evidence (which was collected by
SirW.E.Maxwell nodoubt mainly inPerak) Iwould
addthat atLabu, inSelangor, Iheard onmore than
oneoccasion astory inwhich theelephant-folk were
described aspossessing, ontheborders ofSiam, acity
oftheir own, where they live inhouses likehuman
beings, andwear their natural human shape. This
story, which was first toldmebyUngku Said Kechil
ofJelebu, wastakendown bymeatthetime, andran
asfollows:—
“AMalay named Laboh went outonedaytohis
rice-field andfound thatelephants hadbeen destroying
hisrice.
“Hetherefore planted caltrops ofacubit and a

night anelephant waswounded inthefootbyoneof

Ghost elephants(gajah krama{) arenotuncommon.
They arepopularly believed tobeharmless, but in-
vulnerable, andaregenerally supposed toexhibit some
outward andvisible sign oftheir sanctity, such asa

genii ofcertain localities, andwhen they arekilled
thegood fortune oftheneighbourhood issupposed to

Thefollowing directions forhunting theelephant

“When you firstmeet with thespoor ofelephant
orrhinoceros, observe whether thefoot-hole contains
anydeadwood, (then) take thetwig ofdeadwood, to-
gether withaballofearth asbigasamaize-cob taken

Then rollupyour ballofearth andthetwig together,
inatree-leaf, breathe upon it,andrecite thecharm (for
blinding theelephant’s eyes), thepurport ofwhich is
that ifthequarry sees, itseyesight shall bedestroyed,

The perquisites ofthePawang (magician) aretobe
“alittle black clothandalittlewhite cloth,” andthe
only special taboo mentioned byLebai Jamal was“on
noaccount toletthenaked skin rubagainst theskin
oftheslain animal.”
Before leaving thesubject ofelephants, Imayadd
thatRaja Ja‘far (ofBeranang inSelangor) toldme
thatLebai Jamal, when charged byanelephant or
rhinoceros, would drawupon theground with hisfinger
alinewhich theinfuriated animal wasnever able to
cross. This line,hesaid,was called theBaris Lak-
samana, orthe“Admiral’s Line,” andtheknowledge
ofhow todraw itwasnaturally looked upon asagreat
acquisition.

power toinform aspirit, awild beast,

V THETIGER 157
TheTiger
“The Tiger issometimes believed tobeaman
ordemon intheform ofawild beast, and tothe
numerous aboriginal superstitions which attach tothis
dreaded animal Muhammadanism hasadded thenotion
which connects theTiger with theKhalif Ali.One
ofAli’s titles throughout theMoslem world is ‘the
Victorious Lion oftheLord/ and inAsiatic countries,
where thelion isunknown, thetiger generally takes
theplace ofthe‘king ofbeasts/”1
But theanthropomorphic ideas oftheMalays
about theTiger goyetfarther than this. Faraway in
thejungle (as Ihave several times been told inSelan-
gor)thetiger-folk (no lessthan theelephants) have a
town oftheirown,where they live inhouses, and act
inevery respect likehuman beings. Inthetown re-
ferred totheir house-posts aremade oftheheart of
theTree-nettle {fras jelatang\ andtheir roofs thatched
withhuman hair—oneinformant added that men’s
bones were their only rafters, andmen’s skins their
house walls—andthere they livequietly enough until
oneoftheir periodical attacks offierceness(meng-
ganas)comes onandcauses them tobreak bounds
andrange theforest fortheirchosen prey.
There areseveral ofthese tiger-villages or“en-
closures” inthePeninsula, thechief ofthem being
Gunong Ledang (theMount Ophir ofMalacca), just
asPasummah isthe chief ofsuch localities in
Sumatra.2Sotoo,from Perak, SirW.E.Maxwell
writes in1881:—

“Amischievous tiger issaidsometimes tohave
broken loose from itspenorfold(pechah kandang).
This isinallusion toanextraordinary belief that, in
parts ofthePeninsula, there areregular enclosures
where tigers possessed byhuman souls live inassocia-
tion. During thedaytheyroam where they please,
butreturn tothekandang atnight.”1
Various fables ascribe tothe tiger ahuman
origin. One ofthese, taken down bymeword
forword from aSelangor Malay, isintended to
account forthe tiger’s stripes. The gistofitranas
follows:—
“Anoldmanpicked upaboy inthejungle with a
white skin,green eyes,andverylong nails. Taking
theboyhome hisrescuer named himMuhammad Yatim
(i.e.‘Muhammad thefatherless ’),andwhen hegrewup

Various nicknames, however, aregiven,

Ionceasked (atLabu) how itwasknown thatthe
tigerused divination, andwas told thisstory ofaman
whohadseen it:—
“A certain Malay hadbeen working, together
with hisnewly-married wife, intherice-fields atLabu,
andonhisstepping aside atnoon intothecoolofthe
forest, hesawatiger lyingdownamong theunder-
wood apparently gazing atsomething between itspaws.
Bycreeping stealthily nearer hewasable atlength to

sented thelineaments ofhiswife, lacking onlythehead.
Hurrying back totherice-field heatoncewarned the
neighbours ofwhat hehadseen, andimplored them to
sethiswife intheir midst and escort herhomeward.
Tothisthey consented, butyet, inspite ofevery pre-
caution, thetigerbroke through themidst ofthemand

bereaved husband thereupon requested them toleave
himalone withthebodyanddepart, andwhen theyhad
done so,hetook thebody inhisarms, andsolaydown
embracing it,with adagger ineither hand. Before
sunset thetiger returned toitskill,andleaptupon the

Thepower ofbecoming aman- orwere-tiger (as it

toonetribe ofSumatrans, theKorinchi Malays, many
ofwhom aretobemetwith intheMalay Native States.

This belief isvery strongly held,andononeoccasion,
when Iasked some Malays atJugra how itcould be
proved thattheman really became atiger, they told
methecaseofamansome ofwhose teeth were plated
with gold,andwhohadbeen accidentally killed inthe

Writing onthesame theme, SirFrank Swettenham
says:—
“Another article ofalmost universal belief isthat
thepeople ofasmall State inSumatra called Korinchi
have thepower ofassuming atwilltheform ofatiger,
and inthat disguise theywreak vengeance onthose

this,but stillthe giftofthisstrange power ofmeta-

members ofsociety should beinbed, theKorinchi
man slipsdown from hishut,and,assuming theform
ofatiger, goesabout‘seeking whom hemay devour.’
“Ihave heard offourKorinchi men arriving ina

only thosewho arepractised intheelemu sehir, the
occult arts,whoarethuscapable oftransforming them-
selves into tigers, andtheKorinchi people profess
themselves afraid toenter theChenaku district.”1
There aremany stories about ghost tigers (rimau
kramat),which aregenerally supposed tohave one
footalittle smaller than theothers {kaki tengkis).
During mystay intheLangat district Iwasshown
onmore thanoneoccasion thespoor ofaghost tiger.
Thishappened once nearSepang village, onawet
andclayey bridle- track, where theunnatural small-
ness ofoneofthefeetwasvery conspicuous. Such
tigers areconsidered invulnerable, butharmless to
man,andarelooked upon generally astheguardian
spirits ofsome sacred spot. One ofthese sacred
spots was theshrine(kramat)of’Toh Kamarong,
about two miles north ofSepang village. This
shrine, itwas alleged, wasguarded byawhite ghost
elephant andghost tiger,whoranged thecountry
round butnever harmed anybody. One day,how-
ever, aChinaman from theneighbouring pepper
plantations offered atthis shrine apiece ofpork,
which, however acceptable itmight have been toa
Chinese saint, soincensed theorthodox guardians of
thisMuhammadan shrine thatoneofthem (theghost
tiger) fellupon theChinaman andslewhim before
hecould return tohishouse.
Byfarthemost celebrated ofthese ghost tigers,
however, were theguardians oftheshrine atthefoot
ofJugra Hill, which were formerly thepets ofthe
Princess ofMalacca (Tuan PutriGunong Ledang).

Local report says that thisprincess lefthercountry
when itwastaken bythePortuguese, andestablished
herself onJugra Hill, asolitary hillonthesouthern
portion oftheSelangor coast, which ismarked on
oldcharts asthe“False Parcelar” hill.
The legend which connects thename ofthis
princess withJugra Hillwasthus told1byMr.G.C.
Bellamy (formerly oftheSelangor Civil Service).
“Bukit Jugra (Jugra Hill) initsisolated position,
andconspicuous as itisfrom thesea,could scarcely
escape being anobject ofveneration totheuneducated
Malay mind. The jungle which clothes itssummit
and sides issupposed tobefullofhantus (demons

interrupted bythe cries ofthe langswayer (a

themutterings ofthebajang (afamiliar spirit) as
hesatontheroof-tree. Butthe‘Putri’ (Princess)
ofGunong Ledang holds thepremier position amongst
thefabulous denizens ofthejungle onthe hill,and it
isstrange that places sofarapart asMount Ophir
and Bukit Jugra should beassociated with one
another intraditionary lore. The story runs that
thisestimable lady, having disposed ofherhusband
bypricking him todeath with needles,2decided
thenceforth tolive free from the restrictions of
married life. Shewas thus able tovisit distant
lands, taking with heracat3offabulous dimensions
asher sole attendant. This catappears tohave
been amost amiable andaccommodating creature,
foronarriving atJugra hecarried thePrincess on

pays periodical visits toJugra Hill,andalthough she
herself isinvisible tomortal eye,herfaithful attendant,
intheshape ofahandsome tiger, isoften tobemet
with asheprowls about theplace atnight. Hehas
never beenknown toinjure anyone,and isreverently
spoken ofasarimau kramat (ghost tiger).”
Totheabove story Mr. C.H.A.Turney (then
Senior District Officer andstationed atJugra) added
thefollowing:—
“The Princess andthestories about herandthe
tiger arewellknown, andthelatter arerelated from
mother todaughter inLangat.
“There are, however, they say,one ortwo
omissions;instead ofone tiger there were two, the
realharimau kramat andanambitious young tiger
whowould also follow thePrincess inherround of
visits. This brute came toanuntimely and igno-
minious end (ashedeserved to)atthehands ofone
Innes, whowasdisturbed whilst reading anewspaper,
and thiscanbeverified byCaptain Syers.
“The other tiger jogged along gaily with his
phantom mistress, andmade night hideous with his
howlings and prowlings allabout theJugra Hill.

two cats,which were intheboatwith her,andwhich,

intended toprotect thedevotee invarious ways from
the tiger’s claws and teeth. Ofthese Iwillgiveone
ortwotypical specimens.
Sometimes acharm isused tokeep thetiger ata
distance(penjauh rimau ):—
“Ho,Bersenu !Ho,Berkaih !
Iknow theorigin fromwhich yousprang;
(Itwas)Sheikh Abuniah Lahah AbuKasap.
Your navel originated from thecentre ofyour crown,
Your breasts are[tobeseen] in[thespoor of]your fore-feet .1
Mayyougowide (ofme)astheSeven Tiers ofHeaven,
Mayyougowide (ofme)astheSeven Tiers ofEarth;
Ifyoudonotgowide,
You shallbearebel untoGod,” etc.
Sometimes thedesired effect isexpected tobe
obtained byacharm forlocking thetiger’s jaws:—
“Ho, SirCruncher !Ho, SirMuncher !
Letthetwigbreak under theweight ofthewild goose.
Fast shutandlocked be(your jaws), byvirtue of‘AliMustapah,
OM. Thus Ibreak (thetusks of) allbeasts thataretusked,
Byvirtue ofthisPrayer from theLand ofSiam.”2
1The explanation given tomeof
these twolineswasthattheywere both
based onafancied resemblance between
theparts referred to.
2Asimilar charm runs, “Madam
Ugly isthename ofyour mother, Sir
Stripes thename ofyourbody. Ifold
upyourtongue andmuzzle yourmouth;
-wig -eak [stands for] letthetwigbreak—break with theweight ofthiswell-
fedwild goose. Be(your mouth) shut
fastand locked. Ifabachelor loses
hisvocation, itdoesnotmatter. ”(Here
follow afewwords ofArabic.) On
reaching home youmust never forget
tounlock thetiger’s jaws, or“hewillcertainly bearagrudge against you !”
Todothisyoumust repeat theArabic
words with which thecharm (just
quoted) concluded, andthenpronounce
theMalay word buka, which means
“open.” The Malays arefond of
enigmatical expressions, inwhich the
partofaword ismade tostand forthe
whole. Cp.infra “Teng [stands for]
theSatengteng flower.” Sometimes
these expressions arepropounded as
riddles, e.g.“Titiong kalau kalauf
outofwhich theguesser wassupposed
tomake “Banyak-banyak be\SI,beLIONG
/a’w/wBALAU.”


BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS CHAP.168
The nextspecimen isdescribed asa“charm for
fascinating ”(striking fearinto) a“tigerandhardening

“OEarth-Shaker, rumble andquake !

Towhichmaybeadded—
“Kun !PayahKun !

When tigers werewounded, itwas said (inSelan-
gor) that theywould doctor themselves with zibat
tasak,which isthename generally given toasortof
poultice usedbythosewhohave justundergone cir-
cumcision. Andwhen atiger was killed asort of
public reception wasformerly always accorded tohim
onhisreturn tothevillage.
Though Ihave notseen theactual reception
(generally miscalled a“wake”), Ionce saw near
Kajang inSelangor atigerwhich hadbeen prepared
fortheceremony. Theanimal waspropped uponall
fours asifalive, andhismouth keptopenbypropping

theroofwith astick. Itwasunfortunately impossible
formetowait fortheceremony, butfrom adescription
which Ireceived afterwards, itwasevidently regarded
asasortof“reception ”given bythepeople ofthe
village toaliveandpowerful war-chief orchampion
(hulubalang)whohadcome topaythem avisit, the
dancing andfencing which takes place onsuch occa-
sions being intended forhisentertainment.
Oneofthese ceremonies, which took place inJugra
inSelangor, wasthusdescribed:—
ATiger's Wake
“At 10a.m.agreat noise ofrejoicing, withdrums
andgongs, approaching Jugra bytheriver, washeard,
andonmyquestioning thepeople, Iwas toldRaja
Yakob hadmanaged toshoot atiger with aspring
gunbehind Jugra Hill,andwasbringing itinstate to
theSultan. Iwent over totheSultan’s atRaja
Yakob’s request toseetheattendants ontheslaughter
ofatiger. The animal wassupported byposts and
fastened inanattitude asnearly aspossible approach-
ingtheliving. Itsmouth wasforced open, itstongue
allowed todropononeside,andasmall rattan attached
toitsupper jawwaspassed over apoleheldbyaman

tiger’s head pulled it,moving theheadupanddown,
andthetwoPanglimas, aftermaking their obeisance to
theSultan, rushed attheir swords, andholding them in
theirhands commenced amost wildandexciting dance.

They spun around onone leg,waving their swords,
thenbounded forward andmade athrust atthetiger,
moving backquickly withthepoint oftheweapon facing
theanimal;theycrawled along theground andsprung
over ituttering defiant yells, they cutandparried at
supposed attacks, finally throwing down theirweapons
andtaunting thedead beastbydancing before itun-
armed. This done, Inas toldmethecarcase was at
mydisposal.
“The death ofthetigernow establishes thefact
oftheexistence oftigers here, forasserting which I
have been pretty frequently laughed at.However
this isnottheJugra pest, abrute whose death would

being atigress 8feetlongand 2feet8inches high.”1
Imayadd thatboth theclaws andwhiskers of
tigers aregreatly sought after ascharms, and are
almost invariably stolen from atigerwhen one iskilled
byaEuropean. Ihave alsoseen atKlang acharm
written ontiger’s skin.
TheDeer2
Anthropomorphic ideas areheldbytheMalays
almost asstrongly inthecase oftheDeer asofany
other animal.

form ofthislegend SirWilliam Maxwell writes as
follows:—
“The deer(rusa)issometimes believed tobethe
metamorphosed body ofamanwho hasdied ofan
abscess intheleg(chctbuk),because ithasmarks on
thelegswhich aresupposed toresemble those caused
bythedisease mentioned. Ofcourse there arenot
wanting men ready todeclare thatthebody ofaman
whohasdied ofchabuk hasbeen seen torisefrom
thegrave and togoaway intotheforest intheshape
ofadeer.”1
TheSelangor legend ispractically identical with
thatcurrent inPerak.
The deer arefrequently addressed, inthecharms
usedbythehunters, exactly asiftheywerehuman
beings, eg.—
“Ifyouwish towear bracelets andrings
Stretch outyourtwo fore-feet.”
These rings and bracelets areofcourse thenooses
which depend from the toils.
Inacharm ofsimilar import wefind:—
“Ho,Crown Prince (Raja Muda) with your Speckled Princess
(Ptitri Dandi),
Rouse youquickly (from your slumbers)
And clasp (round yourneck) King Solomon’s necklace.”
Imayaddthat insome places theP(twang (magi-
cian) willhimself first enter the toils, probably with
theobject ofdeceiving thestag astotheir nature and
purpose.

giving ageneral description ofdeer-catching asprac-
tisedbytheMalays.

before they sally outontheexpedition :Sixoreight

placed onatriangle formed with three rice-pounders,
andtheoldest ofthecompany, usually anexperienced

mysteriously round the coils, beating them with the
sprigs, anderewhile muttering some gibberish, which,
ifpossessing anymeaning, thesage keeps wisely to
himself. During theceremony theyouths ofthe
village lookonwithbecoming gravity andadmiration.
Itisbelieved thattheabsence ofthisceremony would
render theexpedition unsuccessful, thedeer would
prove toostrong fortheropes, andthewood demons
frustrate their sportbyplacing insurmountable obstacles
intheir way. Much faithappears tobeplaced inthe
ceremony. Each coilreferred toabove issixty to
seventy fathoms long,andtotheroperunning nooses,

So,too,they arecalled bycertain specific names
(according totheir breed and colour), which are in
several cases identical with thenames ofthedogs
with which thewild Spectre Huntsman (themost
terrible ofallpersonified diseases intheMalay cate-

Ugliness isbynomeans looked upon asadis-
advantage, butrather theopposite. Anuglydog is
apparently formidable. Thuswefindadogaddressed

“Letnotgothescent (ofthequarry)

Again, thedescription ofthe“good points” of
some ofthese dogswhich isgiven intheAppendix
would, ifugliness and formidability areconvertible
terms, satisfy themost exacting whipper-in, theso-
called good points being forthemost part amere
listofdeformities. These points, however, aremerely
theexternal sign oftheLuck towhich dogs, aswell
ashuman beings, arebelieved tobeborn. Ina

TheSiamang (Hylobates lar),2which walks on its

commonly associated inlegend with thehuman race;
infact, itisnotimpossible that theremaysometimes
have been aconfusion between itsname(siamang)

Malay legend, which Itookdown atLabu inSelangor

Once upon atime herHighness thePrincess
Telan became the affianced bride ofSiMalim
Bongsu. After the betrothal SiMalim Bongsu
sailed away anddidnotreturn when theperiod of
theengagement, which was fixed atfrom three to
fourmonths, came toanend.
Then SiMalim Panjang, elder brother ofSi
Malim Bongsu, decided totake theplace ofhis
younger brother, and bemarried tothePrincess
Telan. The latter, however, repelled hisadvances,
andhetherefore attacked hersavagely;butshe

2There seems tobesome doubt as
tothe scientific nomenclature properly
applicable totheSiamang.
The following isaspecimen ofa
monkey legend :“A little farther up-
stream tworocks facing each other, one
oneach sideofthe river, aresaid to
havebeen theforts oftwo rival tribes
ofmonkeys, theMawah {Simla lar)
andtheSiamang(Simla syndactyla), in
aterrible warwhich waswaged between
them inabygone age.TheSiamangs
defeated their adversaries, whom they
have ever since confined totherightbank ofthe river. Ifanymatter of
factperson should doubt thetruth of
this tradition, arethere nottwo facts
forthediscomfiture ofscepticism—the
monkey forts (called BatuMawah to
thisday) threatening each other from
opposite banks ofthe river, andthe
assurance ofallPerak Malays thatno

3According toanother account, the
siamang issaid tohave originated
from akarpulai,i.e.theroots ofa
pulai tree (theMalay substitute for
cork, used toform floats forthefishing-
nets).

thejungle, sothat SiMalim Panjang desisted from
pursuit. Then theapeclimbed upinto apagar-
anak treewhich grew onthesea-shore, andleaned
over thesea,andthere shechanted these words:—
“OmydearMalim Bongsu,
Youhavebroken yoursolemn promise andengagement,
And Ihave totakeupon myself theform ofanape.”
Now SiMalim Bongsu waspassing atthetime,
andonrecognising thevoice ofthePrincess Telan he
took ablow-gun andshothersothatshe fellintothe
sea.Then hetook rose-water andsprinkled itover
her,sothatsheresumed hernatural shape, andthey
started togohome together. Still, however, Si
Malim Bongsu would notwed her,butpromised that
hewould dosowhen hecame back from hisnext
voyage, whereupon the Princess chanted these
words:—
“Ifyoudonotreturn within threemonths
You willfindmeturned intoanape.”
Thesame course ofevents, however, happened as
before. Malim Bongsu didnotreturn atthetime
appointed;hiselder brother, Malim Panjang once
more attacked her, and, leaping towards anareca
palm, sheoncemore became anape,whereupon she
chanted asbefore:—
“OmydearMalim Bongsu,
Youhavebroken yoursolemn promise andengagement,
And Iamforced tobecome anape.”
Again Malim Bongsu, ashepassed by,heard and
recognised hervoice;butupon learning thathehad

Occasionally theopposite transformation isbelieved
totake place, some species ofthemonkey tribe being
supposed toturn into fish.
Thus theBra (.Macacus cynomolgus) isbelieved to
develop into aspecies offish called senunggang,
andofthefishcalled kalul (kalui orkalue), SirW.E.
Maxwell writes :“The ikan kalul (isbelieved) tobe

TheWildPigandOther Animals
There areseveral superstitions about theWild
Boarwhich prove that itwasnotalways regarded as
anunclean animal.
Ofthese thefollowing recipe, which wasgiven
mebyaJugra (Selangor) Malay, forturning brass
intogold isthemost remarkable:—
“Killawild pigand ripopen itspaunch. Sew
upinthisaquantity ofold‘scrap’brass, piletimber
over it,burn it,andthen leave italone until thegrass
hasgrown right over it.Then digupthegold.”
Again, certain wild boars arebelieved tocarry on
their tushes atalisman ofextraordinary power, which
iscalled rantei babi,or“Wild Boar’s Chain.”
This chain consists, itisasserted, ofthree links of
various metals (gold, silver, andamalgam), and is
hung uponashrub bythewild boarwhen he is

enjoying hiswallow, sothat itisoccasionally stolen
byMalays whoknow hishabits. Imayadd that,
according toaMalay atLangat, the“were-tiger”
{rimau jadi-jadiait) occasionally appears intheshape
ofawildboar escaping from agrave, inthecentre
ofwhich maybeafterwards seen theholebywhich
theanimal hasescaped.
“Among themodern Malays avoidance oftheflesh
ofswine andofcontact withanything connected with
theunclean animal is,ofcourse, universal. Notenet
ofEl- 1slam ismore rigidly enforced than this. Itis
singular tonotice, among apeople governed bythe
ordinances oftheProphet, traces oftheobservance
ofanother form ofabstinence enjoined byadifferent
religion. The universal preference ofthe flesh of
theBuffalo tothat oftheOxinMalay countries is
evidently aprejudice bequeathed tomodern times
byaperiod when cow-beefwas asmuch anabomina-
tion toMalays as itistotheHindus ofIndia at
thepresent day. This isnotadmitted orsuspected
byordinary Malays, whowould probably havesome
reason, based ontherelative wholesomeness ofbuffalo
andcow-beef, toallege indefence oftheir preference
ofthelatter totheformer.”1
Totheabove Imayaddthat itisinvariably the
flesh oftheBuffalo, andnotthatoftheOx,which is
eaten sacrificially ontheoccasion offestivities.2But
the flesh oftheso-called White (albino) Buffalo
(kerbau balar) isgenerally avoided asfood, though I

detailed elsewhere).1
Asmight beexpected, astory is
toldbytheMalays toaccount forthisdistinction. The
general outline ofthetale istotheeffect thataMalay
boy (amere child) fellintothebigrice-bin(kepok)in
hisparents’ absence andwas suffocated bythe rice.
After some days thebody began todecompose, and
theoozeemanating from therice-bin waslicked upby
abuffalo belonging totheboy’s parents. The atten-
tionofthese latter being thus attracted totherice-bin,
they found therein theremains oftheir child, and
thereupon cursed the buffalo, which (we areledto
infer) became“white,” andhasremained soever
since. According toone version, aground -dove
(tekukur)
wasimplicated both intheoffence andthe
punishment which followed it.Wherefore tothis
daynoman eatsoftheflesh ofeither oftheoffenders.
Perhaps themost extraordinary transformation
inwhich theMalays implicitly believe isthat ofthe
Squirrel, which issupposed tobedeveloped from a
large caterpillar called ulatsentadu?
About theCatthere aremany superstitions which
show that itisbelieved topossess supernatural

2Imayadd that thedried penis of
thesquirrel (rhula tupei) isbelieved to
beamost powerful aphrodisiac, and
thatmany Malays believe thatsquirrels
areoccasionally found dead with this
organ caught fastincleft timber.
Mr.H.N.Ridley, inapamphlet on
Malay Materia Medica,already referred
to,says
“Many things areused asaphro-disiacs bythe natives. . . .Among
them aretheovipositor ofagrass-
hopper, which ispopularly supposed to

useofBalanophora forthispurpose as
an illustration ofthe“doctrine of

V IDEAS ABOUT CATS 191
master .1Ontheother hand, catsmust bevery
carefully prevented fromrubbing upagainst acorpse,
for itissaid thatononeoccasion when thiswas
neglected, thebadi orEvil Principle which resides
inthe cat’sbody entered intothecorpse, which thus
became endowed with unnatural lifeandstood up
upon itsfeet. Sotoothesoaking ofthecatinapan
ofwater until itishalf-drowned isbelieved toproduce
anabundance ofrain .2Itis,besides, believed tobe
extremely unlucky tokill cats. Ofthis superstition
Mr.Clifford says:—
“It isacommon belief among Malays that ifa
cat iskilled hewho takes itslife will inthenext
world becalled upon tocarry and pilelogs ofwood,
asbigascocoa-nut trees, tothenumber ofthehairs
onthebeast’s body. Therefore cats arenotkilled;
but iftheybecome toodaring intheir raids onthe
hen-coop orthefood rack, they aretiedtoaraftand
sent floating down stream, toperish miserably of
hunger. The people ofthevillages bywhich they
passmake haste topush the raft outagain into
mid-stream, should itinitspassage adhere tobank
orbathing- hut,andonnoaccount istheanimal
suffered toland. Toanyonewho thinks about it,
thislongandlingering death isinfinitely more cruel
than onecaused byablow from anaxe;butthe
Malays donottrouble toconsider such adetail, and
would care little ifthey did.”3
Before leaving thesubject ofcats, Imust mention
thebelief thatthe“fresh-water fishcalled ikan belidah”
was“originally acat.” SirW.E.Maxwell says that
many Malays refuse toeat itforthis reason, and
1VideJ.R.A.S., S.B., l.c.

192 BEASTS ANDBEAST CHARMS CHAP.
adds, “They declare that itsqualls like acatwhen
harpooned, and that itsbones arevery white and
fine likeacat’s hairs.”1Astory isalsosometimes
told toaccount both forthegeneral similarity ofhabits
ofthecatandthetigerandforthefactthatthelatter,
unlike most oftheFelicia,isnotatree-climber. It
istotheeffect that thecatagreed toteach thetiger
itstricks, which itdid,with theexception oftheart
ofclimbing trees. The tiger, thinking ithad learnt
allthe cat’s tricks, proceeded toattack itsteacher,
when thecatescaped byclimbing upatree;sothe
tigernever learnt how toclimb andcannot climb trees
tothisday.
Even thesmallest andcommonest ofmammals, such
asRatsandMice, aretheobjects ofmany strange
beliefs. Thus “clothes which have been nibbled by
ratsormicemust notbeworn again. They aresure
tobring misfortune, andaregenerally given away in
charity.”2
SotooontheSelangor coast amollusc called siput
tantarang ormentarang isbelieved tohave sprung
from amouse;andmany kinds ofcharms, generally
addressed tothe“Prophet Joseph”(Nabi Yusuf), are
resorted toinorder todriveaway ratsandmicefrom
therice-fields.
Thefollowing passage describes thegeneral ideas
about animal superstitions which prevail ontheeast
coast ofthePeninsula:—
“The beliefs andsuperstitions oftheFisher Folk
would fillmany volumes. They believe inallmanner
ofdevils and local sprites. They fear greatly the
demons that preside over animals, and will not
willingly mention thenames ofbirds orbeasts while

tothem, signifies ananimal, though toothers itis
meaningless, and issupposed nottobeunderstanded
ofthe beasts. To thisword they tack onthe
sound which each beast makes inorder toindicate
what animal isreferred to;thus thepig isthe
grunting cheweh,thebuffalo thecMweh thatsays‘uak,’
andthesnipe thecheweh that cries‘kek-kek.

words, from theanalogy oftheAnimal Spirit. Itis
difficult tosay,without amore searching inquiry than
Ihave yethadtheopportunity ofmaking, whether
Malay magicians would maintain that alltrees had
souls(semangat)
ornot. Allthatwecanbecertain
ofatpresent isthatagoodmany trees arecertainly
supposed bythem tohave souls, such, forinstance, as
theDurian, theCocoa-nut palm, andthetreeswhich
produce Eagle-wood(gharu),Gutta Percha, Camphor,
andagoodmany others.
What canbemore significant than thewords and
actions ofthemenwho informer dayswould tryand
frighten theDurian groves intobearing;orofthe

and rollupyour hair;andhere ismyivory toddy-

wood, Camphor, andGutta (the spirits ofthe first
twoofwhich trees areconsidered extremely powerful
anddangerous) or,above all,ofthereapers whocarry

Aspecial point inconnection with theMalay con-
ception ofthevegetation soulperhaps requires par-
ticular attention, viz.thefactthatapparently deadand
even seasoned timber mayyetretain thesoulwhich
animated itduring itslifetime. Thus, theinstruc-
tions fortheperformance oftherites tobeused atthe

Buluh kasap (rough bamboo), etc., are allsaid to
supply instances oftheconcretions referred to,butthe
mostfamous ofthem alliswithout doubt theso-called
“cocoa-nut pearl,” ofwhich Iquote thefollowing
account from Dr.Denys’s Descriptive Dictionary of
British Malaya.
Cocoa-nut Pearls
The following remarks concerning these peculiar
accretions areextracted fromNature :—
“During myrecent travels,” Dr.Sidney Hickson
writes toascientific contemporary, “Iwasfrequently
asked bytheDutch planters andothers ifIhadever
seen‘acocoa-nut stone.’ These stones aresaid to

ofthecocoa-nut, andwhen found arekeptbythe
natives asacharm against disease and evil spirits.
This story ofthecocoa-nut stone wassoconstantly
toldme,and inevery case without anyvariation in
itsdetails, that Imade every effort before leaving to
obtain some specimens, andeventually succeeded in
obtaining two.
“Oneofthese isnearly aperfect sphere, 14mm.
indiameter, andtheother, rather smaller insize, is
irregularly pear-shaped. Inboth specimens thesur-
face isworn nearly smooth byfriction. The spherical
one Ihave hadcutintotwohalves, but Icanfindno
concentric orother markings onthepolished cut
surfaces.
“Dr.Kimmins haskindly submitted one-half toa
careful chemical analysis, andfinds that itconsists of
pure carbonate oflimewithout anytrace ofother salts
orvegetable tissue.
“Ishould bevery glad ifanyofyour readers
could inform me ifthere areanyofthese stones in
any ofthemuseums, or ifthere isanyevidence
beyond mere hearsay oftheir existence inthe peri-
sperm ofthecocoa-nut.”1
On this letter Mr.Thiselton Dyer makes the
following remarks:—“Dr.Hickson’s account ofthe

“The circumstances oftheoccurrence ofthese

those which attend theformation oftabasheer. In
both cases mineral matter inpalpable masses iswith-
drawn from solution inconsiderable volumes offluid

and inboth instances they aremonocotyledons.
“In thecaseofthecocoa-nut pearls thematerial

Once upon atime amarried couple fellout,and
thehusband surreptitiously introduced stones intothe
cooking-pot inplace oftheyams which hiswifewas
cooking. Then hewent offtoclimb foracocoa-nut,
and asheclimbed, hemocked herbycalling out
“Masak belum ?Masak belum ?”(“Are theycooked
yet ?Are they cooked yet ?”).What shedidby
wayofretaliation isnotclear, butasheclimbed and
mocked her,she issaid tohave retorted, “Panjat
belum? Panjat belum?”(“Have youclimbed it
yet? Have youclimbed ityet?”), areply which
clearly shows thatherwoman’s withadbeen atwork,
andthatshewasnotgoing toallow herhusband to
getthe better ofher .1However thismay be,
adeadlock ensued, the result ofwhich was that
both parties were transformed into stick -insects,
butwere yetcondemned tomock each other as
they haddone during theperiod oftheirhuman
existence.
Ihave often frommyboat, during dark nights on
theLangat river, listened totheweird notewhichmy
Malays invariably ascribed tothese insects, andwhich
isnotinaptly represented byoneoftheMalay names
forthem, viz.“belum-belam” Ihave not yet,how-

TheTualang orSialang Tree
SotoooftheTualang-tree Mr.Wray writes:—
“One ofthelargest and stateliest oftheforest
trees inPerak isthatknown asToallong, orToh
Allong;1ithasaverypoisonous sap,which produces
great irritation when itcomes incontact with theskin.
TwoChinamen whohad felled oneofthese trees in
ignorance, hadtheir faces soswelled andinflamed that
they could notseeoutoftheir eyes,andhadtobeled
about forsome days before theyrecovered from the
effects ofthepoison. Their arms, breasts, andfaces
were affected, andthey presented theappearance of
having averybadattack oferysipelas. These trees
aresupposed tobetheabiding -places ofhantu,or
spirits, when theyhave large hollow projections from
thetrunk, calledrumah hantu,orspirit houses. These
projections areformed when abranch getsbroken off
near thetrunk, andarequite characteristic ofthetree.
There aresometimes three orfour ofthem onalarge
tree,andtheMalays have agreat objection tocutting
down anythataresodisfigured, thebelief being that
ifaman fellsonehewilldiewithin theyear. Asa
rulethese trees are leftstanding when clearings are
made, andthey areasource oftrouble andexpense to
planters and others, who object totheir being left
uncut.
“The following series ofevents actually happened:—AMalay named Panda Tambong undertook, against
theadvice ofhisfriends, tofelloneoftheTohAllong
trees, andhealmost immediately afterwards wastaken
illwith fever, anddied inafewweeks’ time. Shortly

after thissomemenwere sitting plaiting ataps1under
theshade ofanother ofthese ill-omened trees, when,
without anywarning, alarge branch felldown, breaking
thearm ofoneman, andmore orlessinjuring two
others. There wasnotabreath ofwind atthetime,
oranything else likely todetermine the fallofthe
branch. After this itwasdecided tohave thetree
felled, asthere were coolie houses nearly under it.
There wasgreat difficulty ingetting anyonetofell it.
Eventually aPenang Malay undertook thejob,but
stipulated that aPawang,orsorcerer, should be
employed todrive away thedemons first. The
Pawang hung pieces ofwhite andredclothonsticks
round thetree,burnt incense inthe little contrivances
made ofthesplit leaf-stalks ofthebertam palm, used
bytheMalays forthat purpose, cutofftheheads of
twowhite fowls, sprinkled theblood over thetrunk,
and inthemidst ofmany incantations thetreewas
felled without anymishap;but,strange tosay, the
Pawang,whowasahajp andaslave-debtor ofthe
TohPuan Halimah, died about ninemonths after-
wards.”3
There appears tobevery little reason todoubt
that theword Tualang (’TohAlang orSia/ang) isthe
name notofaparticular species oftree,butrather the
generic name ofalltrees inwhich wildbeeshave built
their nests, sothat inreality itsimply means a“Bee-
Tree.”
Ihave notyetsucceeded inobtaining anyofthe

nests, except such asareusedbySakais under Malay

most usually the collectors. Some ofthese latter,
however, were pureMalay charms, andmayperhaps
beconsidered, intheabsence ofcharms collected from
Malays, asevidence ofatleast secondary importance.
Oneofthese charms commences asfollows:—
“Here isthePeeling-knife, theknife withthelong handle,
Stuck intothebuttress ofaPulai-Tree.”1
And another, which isalmost word forword the
same, asfollows:—
“Here isthePeeling-knife, theknife with thelong handle,
With which tostab (lit.peck at)thebuttress ofthePulai-Tree.”2

“When wax iscollected from atree
there aregenerally three persons to

These two latter offices areconsidered

Other haunted trees(pokok berhantu) arethe

thefollowing tradition willperhaps suffice:—
“All trees,” according toMalay tradition, “were
planted by‘the Prophet Elias,’1and are inthe
‘Prophet Noah’s’ charge. Inthedays ofKing
Solomon, trees could speak aswell asbirds and
animals, andseveral ofthetreesnow tobeseen in
the forest arereally metamorphosed human beings.
Such arethe‘Jelotong’ andthe‘Berombong,’ which
inthedays ofKing Solomon werebosom friends,
until there broke outbetween them anunfortunate
quarrel, which terminated in‘SiJelotong’s’ lacing the
skinof‘SiBerombong’allover with stabs from his
dagger, the effect ofwhich stabs remains visible to
thisday. SiBerombong, ontheother hand, cursed
SiJelotong with hisdying breath, praying thathe
might beturned intoatreewithout anybuttresses to

fulfilled. Thus originated thelackofbuttresses atthe

V THECAMPHOR SPIRIT 213
“ThisCamphor language isfirstreferred tobyMr.
Logan inhisaccount oftheaboriginal tribes ofthe
Malay Peninsula,1andhegives alistofeighty
words, thirty-three ofwhich areMalay orderived
from Malay.”
“The Jakuns believe that there isa“bisan” or
spirit, which presides over thecamphor-trees, and
without propitiating this spirit itisimpossible to
obtain thecamphor. This bisan makes atnight
ashrill noise, andwhen thissound isheard itisa
suresign that there arecamphor- trees near athand.
(This bisan isreally oneoftheCicadas which are
sonumerous intheMalayan jungles.)
“When hunting forcamphor thenatives always
throw aportion oftheir foodoutintothejungle before
eating, asanoffering tothebisan.
“No prayers areoffered up,but allfoodmust be
eaten dry, i.e.without sumbul,2orstewed fish,orvege-
tables. Saltmust notbepounded fine;ifitiseaten
fine,thecamphor when found willbeinfinegrains;
but ifeaten coarse thegrains ofcamphor willbelarge.
Inrainy weather thecryofthebisan isnotheard.
Atcertain seasons regular parties ofJakuns, and
sometimes Malays, gointothejungle tosearch for
camphor, andtheyremain there aslong asthree or
fourmonths atatime. Notonlymust themenwho
gointothejungle tosearch forthecamphor speak
the‘Pantang Kapur,’ butalso themenandwomen
leftathome intheKampongs.
“Thecamphor occurs intheform ofsmall grains

trees, andnot inallofthese, and toobtain itthe
treemust becutdown and split up. There are
certain signs which indicate when atree contains
camphor, oneofwhich isthesmell emitted from the
woodwhen chipped. Amanwho isskilled indetect-
ingthepresence ofcamphor iscalled Penghulu Kapur.1
Thecamphor when takenaway from thetree iswashed,
and allchips ofwood and dirt carefully removed, and
itisthen sold toChinese traders atKwala Indau at
prices varying according tothequality from $15 to
$40perkatti.
“TheCamphor language consists ingreat partof
words which areeither Malay orofMalay origin, but
contains, asabove mentioned, alarge number of
words which arenotMalay, butwhich arepresum-
ablyremnants oftheoriginal jakun dialects, which are
apparently almost obsolete otherwise intheIndau and
Sembrong districts ofJohor.”2

Gutta-percha
The trees fromwhich Gutta-percha istaken are
alsosupposed tobeinhabited byaspirit;but this,
theGutta- spirit, being farlessdangerous than the
Eagle-wood spirit, fewer precautions aretaken in
dealing with it.Intheinvocation addressed tothe
Gutta-spirit, thepetitioner asks fortheboon ofa
drop ofthe spirit’s blood, which ofcourse isan
indirect wayofasking forthetree’s sap.
Here isaspecimen ofthecharms used bythe
gutta-collectors:—
“Ho,Prince S’riBali,

isclear that thethunder isneither the

observed when collecting camphor are
most strange;forinstance, thosewho

TheCocoa-nut Palm
Thefollowing instructions tobefollowed bytoddy-

which isboiled into sugar) were given mebya
Kelantan Malay (’Che ‘Abas ofKlanang):—
“When you areabout tosetfoot against the

lines:—
“Peace bewith you,OAbubakar!

Here climb half-way upandsay:—
“Peace bewith you, Little Sister, Handmaiden Bidah,
Drowse notasyoukeep watch andward inthemiddle ofthe

Come andaccompany meonmywayupthis tree.”
Here climb upamong the leaf-stalks, layhold ofthe
central shoot, give itthree shakes, andsay—
“Peace bewith you, Little Sister, Youngest ofthePrincesses,

Doyouaccompany meonmywaydown this tree.”
Nowcommence bybending down oneoftheblossom-
sheaths, layhold ofthe central shoot, and thrice
repeat thefollowing lines:—
“Peace bewithyourHighnesses, Princesses oftheShorn Hairand

Plant Rice intheearly morning, about five,because
that isthehour atwhich infants (theRice Soul being
considered asaninfant) getup.
TheCultivation ofRice
Themost important contribution oftheMalays
totheanimistic theory ofvegetation isperhaps tobe
found inthemany strange ceremonies with which
they surround the culture ofRice. Inorder to
properly understand thesignificance ofthese cere-
monies, however, aproper understanding ofthe
Malay system ofrice -planting isessential, and I
therefore quote inextenso adescription ofrice-
culture, which possesses the additional interest of
being translated from thecomposition ofaMalay :1—

“In starting planting operations, however, the

arefrequent rains, andaccordingly theearth ofthe

Pawang,wasburned;then alltherequisites forrice-

ofpropitiatory service, asort ofapology tothepadi

with tepong tawar (flour mixed withwater) before the
reaping iscommenced, andthe first lotcut issetapart

“Atplanting there arealsoceremonies :asarulethe
beginning oftheplanting season isushered inbya
visitofthewhole body ofvillagers tothemost highly

however, there isaspecial service known asbapua ,*
consisting ofasort ofmock combat, inwhich the
evil spirits arebelieved tobeexpelled from therice-

once inthree orfour years.
“Another occasional service ofapeculiar character,

sport, Inaturally wanted toknow thereason why, so
heexplained thatthenoise ofgunshots would irritate
thehantu,andrender unavailing thepropitiatory service
which wasthen about tobegin. Further inquiry
elicited thestatement that thehantu inquestion was
theonewhopresided over rice-lands and agricultural
operations, andas Iwastoldthat there would beno

andthen tothespot towatch theproceedings. The
placewasasquare patch ofgrass-lawn afewyards
wide, which hadevidently foryears been leftuntouched
bytheplough, though surrounded bymany acres of
rice-fields. Onthispatch asmall wooden altarhad
been built :itconsisted simply ofasmall square plat-
form ofwood orbamboo raised about three orfour
feetabove theground, each corner being supported by
asmall sapling with theleaves andbranches lefton it
andovershadowing theplatform, thesides ofwhich
appeared toface accurately towards thefour cardinal
points. Tothewestern sidewasattached asmall
bamboo ladder leading from theground totheedge of
theplatform. Atthefourcorners ofthepatch ofgrass
were fourlarger saplings planted intheground. On
thebranches ofallthese treeswerehung anumber of

theflesh ofagoatcooked intheordinary way, aswell
asriceand different kinds ofcondiments andsweet-
meats. ThePawang waspresent aswell asanumber
ofthe villagers, andsoon aftermyarrival with the
Penghulu theceremony began bysome ofthevillagers
producing outofabagtheskinofablack malegoat
with thehead andhorns attached andcontaining the
entrails (the fleshhaving beencooked and laidonthe
altar previously). Alarge iron nailfourorfiveinches
long,and thick inproportion, wasplaced vertically in
aholeabout two feetdeepwhich hadbeendugunder
thealtar, andtheremains ofthegoatwere alsoburied
init,with thehead turned towards the east, thehole
being then closed andtheturfreplaced. Some ofthe
goat’s blood, intwococoa-nut shells(tempurong),was
placed ontheground near thesouth sideandsouth-
west corner ofthealtar close totheladder.
“ThePawang,after assisting atthese preliminaries,
thentook hisstand atthewest sideofthealtar, looking
eastward :hecovered hishead, butnothisface, with
hissarong wrapped round itlikeashawl, and pro-
ceeded tolight atorch, theendofwhich wastipped
with incense(kemenyan ).With thishetouched the
bottom ofthealtarplatform fourtimes. Hethentook
acupoftepong tawar anddipped initasmall bundle
offourkinds ofleaves, withwhich hethen sprinkled
thenorth-west andsouth-east corners oftheplatform.
Hethencoughed three times—whether thiswaspartof
theritual, orapurely incidental occurrence, Iamunable
tosay,as itwasnotpracticable tostop theceremony
forthepurpose ofasking questions—andagain applied
thetorch under thealtarandsprinkled withtepong tawar
allthecorners ofit,aswell astherungs oftheladder.

“Atthisstage oftheproceedings fourmenstationed
intherice-field beyond thefour corners ofthepatch

Penghulu,chanted thekalimah, orMuhammadan creed,
three times.
“Then amanholding alarge bowl started from a
point inthe rice-field just outside thenorth side of
thepatch ofturf,andwentround it(first inawesterly

threw about intothe field. Both ofthemwent right

south and east sides ofthealtar ready forplanting.
Having sprinkled themhecutofftheends, asisusually

aboriginal tribes ofCentral Indiawhohave notbeen
converted toHinduism orIslam. That itshould exist
inaMalay community within twenty miles ofthetown
ofMalacca, where Muhammadanism hasbeen estab-
lished forabout six1centuries, iscertainly strange. Its
obvious inconsistency with hisprofessed religion does
notstrike theaverage Malay peasant atall. Itis,
however, thefact that these observances arenot re-
garded withmuch favour bythemore strictly
Muhammadan Malays ofthetowns, and especially by
those thatarepartially ofArab descent. These latter
have notmuch influence incountry districts, but
privately Ihave heard some ofthem express dis-
approval ofsuch ritesandeven oftheceremonies
performed atkramats. According tothem, thelatter
might beconsistent withMuhammadan orthodoxy on
theunderstanding thatprayers were addressed solely
totheDeity;buttheinvocation ofspirits ordeceased
saints andtheir propitiation byofferings could notbe
regarded asotherwise than polytheistic idolatry. Of
course such adelicate distinction—almost assubtle as
thatbetween dulia andlatria intheChristian worship
ofsaints—isentirely beyond theaverage Malay mind;
andeverything issanctioned byimmemorial custom,
which inanagricultural population ismore deeply-
rooted thananybook-learning;sothese ritesarelikely
tocontinue forsome time,and willonly yield gradually
tothespread ofeducation. Such asthey are,theyseem
tobeinteresting relics ofanold-world superstition.

apart inMalay magic ceremonies, andabrushmade
upoftheleaves ofseven different plants, bound up
asusual with acord ofkulit t'rap (thebark ofthe
Wild Breadfruit), andribu-rifat (akindofsmall creeper).
The plants which supplied theleaves ofwhich the
brush wascomposed, were asfollows:—
1.Sapenoh. 2.Sapanggil.3.Jenjuang (orlen-
juang)merah (theRed Dracaena). 4.Gandarusa.
5.Pulut-pulut. 6.Selaguri. 7.Sambau dara (akind

Butthemost interesting object wasasmall oval-

1One ofthese wascalled thepenu-
weisulong (lit. eldest rice -cutter),
which wasonly tobeused—when the
Pawang haddone with it—bythe
owner oftherice-field, andtheblade
ofwhich isfitted intoapiece ofthewood called pompong;
thereason
given being that thepompong was
thewood ofwhich these instruments
were originally made, whilst what I
may callthehandle oftheinstrument

andabout fourteen inches long, which wasstanding
just infront ofthethree rice-baskets andclose tothe
Pawang,andwhich, as Iafterwards found out,was
intended toserve asthecradle oftheRice-soul (or
“Rice-baby ”). Iexamined it,however, andfound
that asyet itonlycontained thefollowing objects:—
1.Astrip ofwhite cloth (folded upand lying atthebottom of
thebasket).
2.Some parti-coloured thread(benang panchazvarna orpancha-

3.Ahen’s egg.

wastobeslung round theneck ofitsbearer. (The cor-
recter custom would require anexpensive cloth ofthe
kind called jong sarat,orthe“Loaded Junk,” accord-
ingtomyinformant thePawang.)
Three newMalay skirts orsarongs were added,
(one toeach basket), andeverything being ready, the
various receptacles described above were entrusted to
fivefemale bearers(Penjawat),whodescended from
thehouse, with thePawang attheir head, andsetout
fortherice-field. Before theyhadgonemany yards
theywere joined bytheowner ofthe field,whowalked

kind ofsugar-cane, which wasused insubstitution
fortheblack or“raven”variety(tebugagak) which,
thePawang explained, would have been used inpre-
ference ifithadbeen obtainable. Meanwhile the
procession passed on,and thePawang repeated as
wewent thefollowing prayer tothespirits:—

Then forafewmoments shestood still, close tothe
sheaf with herhead bent forward andburied among
theears, afterwhich shereseated herself anddabbled
thetepong tawar thrice upon theroots ofthesheaf.
Oneofthefemale bearers nowplanted thestem ofthe
sugar-cane upright inthecentre ofthesheaf,1whilst
thePawang sprinkled itwith thetepong tawar,

Here thePawang andPenjawat (Female Bearer),
together proceeded toplant thesugar-cane inthe

round thesugar-cane) drew thewaist ofthesheaf
together andbelted itwithsome oftheouter stems of

(onthethreshold) wewere metbythewife ofthe

thrice calling outasweapproached, “Apakhabar ?”
(“What news?”), andthrice receiving thereply,“Baik”
(“It iswell”). Onreceiving thisreply forthethird
time shethrew saffron -rice over thePawang and
repeated these lines:—
“Chop the‘tree’Galenggang (akind ofshrub),
Chop ittopieces infront ofthedoor:
Yonder comes Oneswinging (her)arms;
That (methinks) isachild ofmine.”
Towhich thePawang immediately replied:—
“Chop theyoung bamboo-shoots asfineasyoucan,
Ifyouwish tostupefy thefishinthemain stream.

And thebearer oftheRice-child added—doubtless
ontheRice-child’s behalf:—
“Thismeasure isnotameasure filled with pepper,

Butgreat (rather) wasmydesire, thewish ofmyheart.”

Bearers returned,1each oftheir rice-baskets covered
with asarong. These baskets were carried into the
bedroom anddeposited inorder ofsizeonthemat at
thefootofthesoul-basket, thelargest basket being
thenearest tothesoul-basket. Finally, thePawang
removed thesarongs which covered each basket and
deposited them ontheRice-child’s pillow, andsticking
the“penuweis ”intoherhair,fumigated theentire row
ofbaskets andtheRice-child, andcovered them over
with thelongwhite cloth, afterwhich thewife ofthe
master ofthehouse was told toobserve certain rules
oftaboo forthree days.
Thefollowing were thetaboos imposed upon her:—
1.Money, rice, salt, oil,tame animals, etc.,were forbidden to
leave thehouse, though theymight enter itwithout ill
consequences.
2.Perfect quietmustbeobserved, asinthecaseofanew-born
child.
3.Hairmight notbecut.
4.The reapers, tilltheendofthereaping, were forbidden tolet
theirshadows fallupon the rice. (Yang menuwei sampei

5.The lightplaced near thehead oftheRice-child’s bedmight
notbeallowed togooutatnight, whilst thehearth -fire
might notbeallowed togooutatall,night orday, for
thewhole three days.
Theabove taboos are inmany respects identical
with those which have tobeobserved forthree days
after thebirth ofareal child.
1Iwas toldbythePawang that
when thethree reapers hadeach filled
herbasket, each ofthem tied the
leaves ofthe riceclumps together,

their reaping, they have torepeat thefollowing
charm:—
“Aswallow has fallen, striking theground,
Striking theground inthemiddle ofourhouse-yard;
But ye,OShadows andSpectral Reapers,
Seethatyemingle notwith us.”
When reaping, theymust cover theirheads andmust
face thesun,nomatter what hour oftheday itis,in
order toprevent theirownshadows from falling upon
therice inthebasket attheir side.
Pounding thefirst ofthepadi.—Iwitnessed this
ceremony three days later, atabout 9a.m.Thethree
baskets filled with the first reapings were removed
from thematonwhich theyhadbeen placed, andtheir
contents emptied outupon anewmat, toeach corner
ofwhich four rice-ears were tied,andtrodden out(di-

waspoured back intotwoofthebaskets, andthestraw
oftherice“heads”wasplaited intoawreath.1
Drying thefirstofthepadi.—Preparations being

Pounding ofthericefrom thethree baskets.—When
the ricehadbeen sufficiently dried, itwasoncemore
collected inthebaskets, andcarried back tothehouse
tobepounded .1That operation took place thesame
evening, when the ricewaspounded andwinnowed2
intheordinary way, theonly noteworthy addition
being thetying ofbunches ofthegrass called sambau
dara totheupper ends ofthelongwooden pestles
which theMalays useforthepounding operation.
Disposal oftheempty rice-stalksfrom thethree

heap bytheowner ofthefield inaplace where three
paths met,crowned with awreath made oftheempty
rice-stalks, andcovered byabigstone which was in-

Inorder toconfine the “Rengkesa ”(aSpectral

These noxious spirits being thus confined tothe
Four Corners, youmay search insafety tillyou find

How women should reap onordinary occasions.
—Whenever women goout toreap they should
repeat certain charms before leaving thehouse,1and
again before depositing their baskets ontheground.
Their heads should becovered, and they should
always becareful toreap, ashasbeen said, facing
thesun, toprevent their shadow from falling upon
therice inthebasket attheir side. Occasionally,
however, thebody isuncovered, and Iwaseven
told ofone, Inche Fatimah ofJugra, inSelangor,
whowhen reaping stripped herself bare from the
waist upwards, andwhen askedwhyshedidsosaid
itwas“tomake therice-husks thinner, asshewas
tired ofpounding thick-husked rice.”
The sheaf which isleftstanding after thetaking
home oftheRice-soul iscalled theMother ofthe
Rice-soul {Ibu Semangat Padi), and treated asa
newly-made mother;that istosay,young shoots of

When thethree days areupyoutake cocoa-nut

ofbanana (such aspisang abuandpisang Benggala),

The lastsheaf (as Ithink Ihave said) isreaped

IntheWestern States ofthePeninsula byfarthe
most important branch ofindustry hasformany years

Chinese, theceremonies used attheopening oftin-
mines arepurely Malay incharacter.
Thepostofmining wizard, once ahighly lucrative
one,was inpastdaysalmost always filledbyaMalay,
though occasionally theservices ofaJungle -man
[Sakai) would bepreferred. These mining wizards
enjoyed intheirpalmy days anextraordinary reputa-

bringing oretoaplace where itwasknown thatno
oreexisted;some, too,were believed topossess the
power ofsterilising such oreasexisted, andofturning

Theoreitself isregarded asendued notonlywith

itisdescribed asresembling abuffalo, inwhich shape

upon traditions ofalode,though itisquite inkeeping
oftheceremonies described. The

minerals, theGold spirit being supposed totake the
shape ofakijang orroe-deer (whence thetradition
ofagolden roe-deer being found atRaub inPahang).
Inconnection with thesubject oftin-mining the
account contributed1in1885byMr.Abraham Hale
(then Inspector ofMines intheKinta district of
Perak) totheJournal oftheStraits Asiatic Society isof
suchvalue astonecessitate itsbeing quoted inextenso.
Itwillbefollowed bysuch notes upon mining invoca-
tions as Iwasable tocollect inSelangor, afterwhich
afewremarks upon theMalay theory ofanimism in
minerals generally willbring thesubject toaconclusion.
Tocommence with Mr.Hale’s account:—“The
valley oftheKinta is,andhasbeen foraverylong
time, essentially amining country. There are inthe
district nearly fivehundred registered mines, ofwhich
three areworked byEuropean Companies, the rest
being either private mines, i.e.mines claimed by
Malays, which have beenworked bythem and their
ancestors foranindefinite period, ornewmines, in
other words new concessions given indifferently on
application toMalays andChinese. There areabout
three hundred and fiftyprivate Malay mines, and itis
with these principally that thefollowing paper will
deal.
“So far,nolodes have been discovered inKinta;
itis,however, probable that, asthecountry isopened
upandprospectors getupamongst thespurs ofthe
main range, thesources ofthestream tinwillcome to

“This stream tinhasprobably been worked for
several centuries inKinta;local tradition says that a
verylongtimeagoSiamese were theprincipal miners,
andthere isevidence thatvery extensive work has
been done here bysomebody atatimewhen the
method was different from thatwhich iscommonly
adopted byKinta Malays atthepresent day. There
areatleast fiftydeep well-like pitsontheLahat hill,
averaging about eight feet indiameter andperhaps
twenty feetdeep.
“Further upcountry Ihave seenalarge pitwhich

theinheritor ofvarious remnants andtraditions ofthe
religion which preceded Muhammadanism, and in
theolden time thisclass ofpersons derived avery
fairrevenue from theexercise oftheir profession, in

aswell astheChinese miner, oftheoldschool, with
their thousand-and-one superstitions, hasgiven place
toamore modern and matter-of-fact race,whoplace
more reliance forprospecting purposes onboring tools
thanonthedivination andjampi ofthepawang.
Buttheprofession ofthepawang hasnotaltogether
died out,asheissometimes called into requisition for
thepurpose ofcasting outevil spirits from themines;
ofconverting amang1(pyrites) into tin -ore,andof
invoking thespirits ofamine previous tothebreaking
ofthe firstsodinanew venture. These ceremonies
generally involve theslaying ofabuffalo, agoat, or
fowls, andtheoffering ofbetel-leaf, incense, and rice,
according tothemeans ofthetowkay lombong.
“Thetermpawang isnowusedbytheChinese
toindicate the‘smelter’ (Chinese) ofamine (prob-
ablyfrom thefact that this office wasformerly the
monopoly oftheMalay pazvang).
“To thepawangs are attributed extraordinary
powers, forbesides inducing tin-ore tocontinue or
become plentiful inamine, hecancause itsdisappear-
ancefrom arich‘claim’bytheinevitable jampi,this

tocarry out hispecuniary obligation towards the

The failure oftheSungei Jelok mines wasattributed
toherdispleasure onaccount ofanalleged breach of

“Thetermpawang issometimes used asaverb
inthesense of‘toprospect’asungei orstream;
thus inalluding tocertain streams ormines, itisnot
uncommon tohear aMalay saythattheyhavebeen
prospected(sudah di-pawangkan)by‘Inche’ So-and-
so—meaning that thestream hadbeen discovered
andproved byapawang prior totheopening ofthe

itspresence byapeculiar noise heard inthe stillness

abouts.”3
Inastilllater article, after briefly referring tothe
useofthebhasa pantang,or“Taboo Language,”
bytin-miners inSelangor, Mr.Pasqual proceeds:—
“There are,again, certain actswhich areforbidden.
Inthemine, especially ifthekarang4hasnotyetbeen
removed, itisforbidden towear shoes orcarry an
umbrella. This rule, itseems, originated with the
coolies themselves, who inolden times insisted thatthe

alleged, thespirits might notbeoffended. Buttheir

Theremaining notes onmining ceremonies and

ingthetin-bearing stratum, thetin-ore isaddressed
byname:—
“Peace bewith you,OTin-Ore,

Sometimes each grain oforeappears tobecon-

(4)Toinduce the spirits topartake ofabanquet
which isspread forthem inareceptacle intended
tobethemodel ofaroyal audience-chamber.
This, the “spirits’ audience-chamber” (as itis
called), isusually from two tothree feet square, and
isfilled with offerings similar incharacter tothose
usually deposited onthe sacrificial tray (anckafc), with
theaddition, however, ofcertain articles which are
considered tobespecially representative oftheminers’
food. These articles aresugar-cane, plantains, yams,
sweet potatoes, and fish, etc.;allofwhich should be
placed together with thecustomary offerings inthe
“spirits’ audience-chamber.” Outside the“audience-
hall,” ateach ofthetwo front corners, should be
placed aredandawhite flagandawaxtaper;andat
each ofthetwoback corners should beplaced ataper,
making inallfour flagsandseven tapers.
Astandard censer(perasapan)

front ofthe“audience-chamber,” andasecond small
censer must alsobeobtained, sothatburning incense
maybe“waved”toand frounderneath thefloor of
theaudience-chamber inorder tofumigate itbefore
theofferings aredeposited inside it.
During thefumigation acharm isrecited, inwhich
the assistance ofthe spirits ofcertain canonized
Muhammadan worthies isinvoked, concluding
thus:—
“Peace bewith you,OWhite Sheikh, wizard ofthevirgin
jungle,
Wizards old,andwizards young,

Icrave pardon forallmistakes,
For allshortcomings Ibegpardon inevery particular.”
Thenwhen thetapers are alllighted andtheoffer-

follows:—
“Ho,White Sheikh, king ofthevirgin jungle,

Give your orders toalltheElders oftheearth andPrinces

Thechief taboos arethekilling ofanysortofliving
creature within themine;towear asarong (Malay
skirt);tobring intothemine theskinofanybeast;
andtowear shoes oruseanumbrella within themine.
These aresome oftheperpetual taboos, butnodoubt
there aremany others.
Inthecaseofasacrifice, however, thewhite buffalo
mayofcourse bekilled, notwithin themine itself, but
stillupon itsbrink;andwhen this isdone, thehead is
buried, andsmall portions (which must be“repre-
sentative” ofevery partofthecarcase) should betaken
anddeposited inthe“audience-chamber.”
Among theseven days’ taboos arementioned the
killing ofanyliving timber (within theprecincts ofthe
mine ?),lewdness, andthepraising oradmiring ofthe
“grass seed” {pttji buah rumput), which isthename
bywhich thetin-ore must invariably becalled within
theprecincts ofthemine. This lasttaboo isdueto
theuseofaspecial mining vocabulary towhich the
greatest attention wasformerly paid, andwhich did
notdiffer very greatly from thatused inPerak.

The qualities ofthegold vary greatly inthesame

theprincipality ofPahang, ontheeastern sideofthe
Malay Peninsula, which brings ahigher price than
even that ofAustralia bybetter than three percent.
Thegold isallobtained bywashing, andthemetal has

Gold, silver, andanamalgam formed ofthetwo,

these gold is,toavery uncertain and partial extent,
stillsometimes regarded asaroyal prerogative .3
OfSilver still lessinformation hasbeen collected

hasnotyetbeen found inpayable quantities, whereas
many goldmines exist. Itisjust possible, however,
that silvermaybeworked bytheMalays onasmall

possible evidence ofanimistic ideas about Iron. Thus
fortheSacred Lump ofIronwhich forms partofthe

originated from ideas ofceremonial purification.
2.THE SEA, RIVERS, ANDSTREAMS
TheMalays have been from timeimmemorial a
sea-faring race,andarequite assuperstitious intheir
ideas oftheseaassailors inother parts oftheworld.
Ashasbeen already indicated,1their animistic
notions include abelief inWater Spirits, both ofthe
seaandofrivers, and occasionally this belief finds
expression inritual observances.
Thus, forinstance, itwasformerly thecustom to
insert anumber ofsugar-palm twigs (segor kabong)into
thetopoftheship’s mast, making theendofitlook
notunlike asmall birch ofblack twigs .2
This wasintended toprevent theWater Spirit

V IMPORTANCE OFRIVERS 281
Theimportance ofrivers intheMalay Peninsula,
and forthat matter, inMalayan countries generally,
canhardly beoverrated. Itwasbytherivers that
Malay immigration, coming forthemost part, ifnot
entirely, from Sumatra, entered theinterior ofthe
Peninsula, andbefore theinflux ofEuropeans had
superseded them byroads and railways the rivers
were thesolemeans ofinland communication. All
oldMalay settlements aresituated onthebanks of
rivers orstreams, bothonthisaccount andbecause
ofthenecessity ofhaving aplentiful supply ofwater
forthepurpose ofirrigating the rice-fields, which
constitute themain source oflivelihood forthe in-
habitants.
Accordingly thebackbone, sotospeak, ofaMalay
district istheriver that runs through it,andfrom
which inmost cases the district takes itsname;for
here, aselsewhere, theriver-names aregenerally older
than thenames ofterritorial divisions. They areoften
unintelligible andprobably ofpre-Malayan origin, but
aresometimes derived from theMalay names offorest
trees. Asaruleevery reach andpoint hasaname
known tothelocal Malays, eventhough therivermay
runthrough forest andswamp with only afewvillages
scattered atintervals ofseveral miles along itsbanks.
Ofriver legends there arenotafew.The follow-
ingextract relates tooneofthelargest rivers ofthe
Peninsula, theriver Perak, which gives itsname to
thelargest andmost important oftheMalay States of
theWest Coast. Perak means silver, though none is
mined inthecountry;andthelegend isafairspecimen
ofthesortofstory which grows upround anattempt
toaccount foranotherwise inexplicable name:—
“On their return down-stream, theRaja and his

followers halted atChigar Galah, where asmall stream
runs into theriver Perak. They were struck with
astonishment atfinding thewater ofthisstream as
white assantan (thegrated pulp ofthecocoa-nut

despatched tothesource ofthestream todiscover
thecause ofthisphenomenon, found there alarge fish
ofthekind called haruan engaged insuckling her

down bymefrom aLabu Malay inSelangor, but
Ihave notmetwith itelsewhere;aparallel version
ofthestory quoted byMaxwell being thecom-
monest form ofthelegend inSelangor aswell as
Perak.
SirWilliam Maxwell’s account runs asfollows:—

with thetiger andelephant. Just asinsome parts

falling onhisknees inthebottom oftheboatand
entreating forgiveness, ontheground that the indi-
vidual reptile aimed atwas kra,7nat,and that the
speaker’s family would notbesafe ifitwere injured.
The source ofideas like this lies fardeeper inthe
Malay mind than hisMuhammadanism;but the
new creed has, inmany instances, appropriated and
accounted forthem. The connection ofthe tiger
with Ali,theuncle oftheprophet, hasalready been
explained. Agrosser Muhammadan fable hasbeen
invented regarding thecrocodile.
“This reptile, saythePerak Malays, was first
created inthefollowing manner:—
“There wasonceupon atimeawoman called Putri
Padang Gerinsing, whose petitions found great favour
andacceptance with theAlmighty.
“She itwaswhohadthecareofSitiFatima, the
daughter oftheProphet. One dayshetooksome

sheplaced asharp stone, andshemade eyes outof
bitsofsaffron(kuniet);the tailwasmade ofthe
mid-rib andleaves ofabetel-nut frond. Sheprayed
toGodAlmighty that thecreature might have life,
and itatoncecommenced tobreathe andmove.
Foralong time itwasaplaything oftheProphet’s
daughter, SitiFatima;but itatlength became
treacherous and faithless toTuan Putri Padang
Gerinsing, whohadgrown oldand feeble. Then
Fatima cursed it,saying, 'Thou shalt bethecroco-
dileofthesea,noenjoyment shall bethine, andthou
shalt notknow lustordesire.’ Shethen deprived
itofitsteeth andtongue, anddrove nails into its
jaws toclose them. Itisthese nails wdiich serve
thecrocodile asteeth tothisday. Malay Pawangs
inPerak observe thefollowing methods ofproceeding
when itisdesired tohook acrocodile:—Tocommence
with, awhite fowlmust beslain intheorthodox way,
bycutting itsthroat, andsome ofitsblood must be
rubbed onthe line (usually formed ofrattan) to
which thefowl itself isattached asbait. Thedying
struggles ofthefowl inthewater areclosely watched,
andconclusions aredrawn fromthem astotheprob-
able behaviour ofthecrocodile when hooked. If
thefowlgoes toaconsiderable distance thecrocodile
willmost likely endeavour tomake off; but itwill
beotherwise ifthefowlmoves alittlewayonlyup
anddown oracross thestream.
“When theline issetthefollowing spellmust be

(‘Kun saith God, sokun saithMuhammad; nailbe

oftheproceedings.”1
The rarer story, towhich allusion hasbeenmade,
wasthefollowing:—
“There wasawoman whohadachildwhich had
just learnt tositup(tahududok),and towhich she
gave thename of‘Sarilang.’ Onedayshetook the
child totheriver-side inorder tobathe it,butduring
thelatter operation itslipped from hergrasp and fell

repaired totheriverandcalled upon thename ofher

saw thatfrom thewaist downwards hehadalready

dragging itspreyunder water. Crocodiles inhabiting
ariver aresaid toresent theintrusion ofstrangers
from other waters, andfights often take place incon-
sequence. According totheMalays they aregifted
with two pairs ofeyes. Theupper ones they use
when above water, andtheunder pairwhen beneath
thesurface. This latter pair issituated half-way be-
tween themuzzle andtheangle ofthemouth, onthe
under surface ofthelower jaw. These areinreality
noteyes, butinward folds ofskinconnected byaduct
with ascent gland, which secretes anunctuous sub-
stance ofadark gray colour, with astrong musky
odour. Medicinal properties areattributed tothe
flesh ofthemales, which arebelieved tobeofvery
rare occurrence, and tobequite unable toleave the
water byreason oftheir peculiar conformation. The
fact isthat thesexes arealmost undistinguishable,
except ondissection, andtherefore thenatives class all
thatarecaught asfemales. While onthis subject, it
maybeworth mentioning that atPortWeld there
used tobeatame crocodile which would comewhen
called. TheMalays fed itregularly, and said itwas
not vicious, andwould notdoanyharm. Itwas
repeatedly seenbytheyearly visitants toPortWeld,
orSapetang, astheplacewasthen called, andwas a
finebiganimal, withabunch ofseaweed growing on
itshead. Some onehad itcalled, andthen fired atthe
poor thing;whether itwaswounded oronlyfrightened
isuncertain, but itnever came again.”1

tocoincide with thetime“when therice-stalks swell
with thegrain,” i.e.theendofthewetseason.
Themost prolific species ofcrocodile isreputed
tobethebuaya lubok,orBight crocodile (also called
buaya rawang,orMarsh crocodile), which lays as
many asfifty orsixty eggs inasingle nest. Other
varieties, Imay add, arethebuaya tembaga (Copper
crocodile), thebuaya katak (Dwarf crocodile), which
is,asitsname implies, “short and stout,” andthe
buaya hitam orbest(Black orIron crocodile), which is
reported toattain alarger sizethananyother variety.
This latter kind isoften moss-grown, and ishence
called buaya berlumut (Mossy crocodile). The largest
specimen ofthis variety ofwhich Ihave hadany
reliable account isonewhich measured “fourfathoms,
lessonehasta ”(about 23feet), andwhich wascaught
inthetime ofSultan Mahmat atSungei Sembilang,
nearKuala Selangor, byoneNakhoda Kutib.
The buaya jolong-jolong,which has attracted
attention owing toitsreputed identification with the
gavial ofIndian waters, andwhich istherefore no
true crocodile, ispointedly described byMalays as
separating itselffrom theother species.
Finally, there isthebuaya gulong tenun (the
“Crocodile thatRolls uptheWeft” ?),which isnot,
however, thename ofaseparate variety, but isthe
name applied totheYoung Person orNewWoman of
theworld ofcrocodile-folk —theaggressive female who
“snaps”ateverything andeverybody forthemere
glory ofthesnap!’


V HABITS OFTHECROCODILE 289
‘‘After hatching,” says Mr.Wray, “the mother
watches, and . . .eatsup allthose which runaway
from thewater, butshould anyescape herandget
away ontotheland they will turn into tigers.”
There isperhaps more point intheSelangor tradition,
according towhich the little runaways turn, notinto
tigers, butinto “iguanas ”(Monitor lizards).
Asregards thewant ofatongue, which issupposed
tobecommon toallcrocodiles, itissaidtheywere so
created bydesign, inorder thattheymight notacquire
toopronounced a“taste” forhuman flesh. Hence
theproverb which declares thatnocarrion istoobad
forthem towelcome :“Buaya mana tahu menolak
bangkei?”(“When willcrocodiles refuse corpses?”)1
After theoutbreak offerocity(ganas)among the
crocodiles intheKlang River lastyear,some account
oftheway inwhich thecrocodile ishere said tocapture
anddestroy hishuman victims mayprove ofinterest.
Every crocodile has,according totheSelangor
Malay, three setsoffangs, which arenamed asfollows :
(1)sihampa daya*(two above andtwo below), at
thetipofthejaws
;(2)entah-entah (two intheupper
andtwo inthelower jaw), half-way up
;(3)charik
kapan (two intheupper andtwo inthelower jaw),
near thesocket ofthejaws.
The firstmaybetranslated by“Exhaust your
devices”
;thesecond by“Yesorno”
;andthethird
by“Tear theshroud,” thelatter being areference to
theselvage which, among theMalays, istorn offthe

Ifaman iscaught bythe “Exhausters ofall
Resources,” hehasafairchance ofescape;ifcaught
bythe“Debateable”teeth hisescape isdecidedly
problematical;but ifcaught bythe“Tearers ofthe
Shroud,” he istoallintents andpurposes adead
man. Whenever iteffects acapture thecrocodile
carries itsvictim atoncebelow thesurface, andeither
tries tosmother him inthe soft,thickmud oftheman-
grove swamp, orpushes himunder asnag orprojecting
root, with theobject ofletting himdrown, while it
retires towatch himfrom ashort distance. After
what itconsiders asufficient interval toeffect itspur-
pose, thecrocodile seizes thebody ofthedrowned man
and rises tothesurface, when it“callsupon theSun,
Moon, andStars tobearwitness”that itwasnotguilty
ofthehomicide—
“Bukan akumembunoh angkau^
Ayeryangmembunoh angkau.”
Which, being translated, means—
“Itwasnot Iwho killed you,
Itwaswater which killed you.”1
After thrice repeating thisstrange performance,
thecrocodile again dives andproceeds toprepare the
corpse for itsprospective banquet. Embracing the
corpse with its“arms,” andcurving the tipofits

powerful tailunder itsown belly (until the tail isnearly
bent double), itcontrives tobreak thebackbone ofthe
victim, andthenpicking upthebody oncemore with
itsteeth, dashes itviolently against atrunk orroot in
order tobreak thelongbones ofthelimbs. When
thebones arethussobroken astooffernoobstruction,
itswallows thebody whole—thus affording aremark-
able parallel totheboa initsmethod ofdevouring its
prey, and recalling Darwinian ideas oftheir cousin-
hood. Miraculous escapes have, however, occasionally
occurred. Thus Lebai ‘Aliwascaught byacrocodile
atBatuBurok (Kuala Selangor), oneevening asthe
tidewasebbing, andthecrocodile, after smothering
him effectually (as itthought) inthethickmud, retired
toawait theend. Insensibly, however, itfloated
farther and farther offwith thefalling tide,andLebai
‘Ali,seeing hisopportunity, made aboldandsuccessful
dash forfreedom.
Asimilar casewasthatofSiKa’,whowaspushed
under abamboo rootontheriverbank bythecroco-
dilewhich caught him,andwho, after waiting tillhis
formidable enemy hadfloated alittle farther offthan
usual, drew himself upbyanoverhanging stem and
swarmed up it.Atthesamemoment thecrocodile
made arush,andactually caught himbythegreat toe,
which latter, however, hewillingly surrendered tohis
enemy astheprice ofhisliberty.
Ayetmore marvellous escape, was that of
theyouth belonging totheGovernment launch
atKlang, who escaped, itisrelated, bythetime-
honoured expedient ofputting histhumbs into the
crocodile’s eyes. Inconnection with this latter exploit,
bytheway,Malay authorities assert thatthecrocodile’s
eyesprotrude from their sockets onstalks (like those


292 REPTILES ANDREPTILE CHARMS CHAP.
ofacrab) solong ashestays under water, thestalks
being “aslong astheforefinger,” sothat itisquite
aneasy matter tocatch hold ofthese living
“pegs.”
Forthe rest, crocodiles aresaidbytheMalays to
have asort offalse stomach divided into several
pouches orsacs, onesacbeing forthestones which
they swallow, andanother fortheclothes andaccoutre-
ments oftheirhuman victims, these pouches being in
addition totheir realstomach (inwhich theremains of
monkeys, wild pig,mouse-deer, andother small animals
arefound), and, inthecase offemale specimens, the
ovary. Thesecond pair ofeyes intheneck which,
Mr.Wray says, they aresupposed tousewhen below
thesurface, areinSelangor supposed tobeused at
night, whence they arecalled matamalam,ornight-
eyes, asopposed totheir realeyeswhich they are
supposed touseonlybyday.
Asregards thestones, which crocodiles undoubtedly
swallow, they aresometimes supposed toenable each
male crocodile tokeep anaccount ofthenumber of
rivers which ithasentered, ofthenumber ofbights it
haslived in,oreven ofthenumber ofitshuman
victims. The noise which crocodiles makewhen fight-
ingresembles aloud roar orbellow, andtheMalays
apply thesame wordmenguak tothebellow ofthe
crocodile aswellastothatofthebuffalo.
Thewrath ofthecrocodile-folk isprovoked by
thosewho wish toshoot them, invarious ways, of
which, perhaps, thecommonest istodabble asarong;
or(as issaid tobemore effectual) awoman’s mosquito-
curtain, inthewater oftheriverwhere they live. So
also tokeep two setsofweights andmeasures (one
forbuying andanother forselling, asissometimes

donebytheChinese), issaid tobeacertain means of
provoking their indignation.
The crocodile-wizard issometimes credited with
thepower ofcalling thecrocodile-folk together, and
ofdiscovering aman-eater among them, andaneye-
witness lately described tomethescene ononesuch
occasion. AMalay hadbeen carried offanddevoured
byacrocodile atLarut, andaBatu Bara man,who
wentbythesobriquet ofNakhoda Hassan, undertook
todiscover theculprit. Sprinkling some oftheusual
sacrificial rice-paste (tepong tawar) and “saffron”
riceupon thesurface oftheriver, hecalled outinloud
tones tothevarious tribes ofcrocodiles intheriver,
andsummoned them toappear onthesurface. My
informant declares that not lessthan eight orten
crocodiles actually appeared, whereupon thePawang
commanded them alltoreturn tothebottom with the
exception oftheonewhich was guilty. Inafew
moments onlyonecrocodile remained onthesurface,
and thisone,onbeing forthwith killed andcutopen,
wasfound tocontain thegarments oftheunfortunate
manwhohadbeen captured by it.Similar stories of
theprowess ofcrocodile charmers are toldbythe
Javanese.1
Ishallnowproceed todescribe themethods and
ceremonies used forthecatching ofcrocodiles. The
following isadescription byMr.J.H.M.Robson, of
Selangor, ofthemost usual method, atallevents in
Selangor, but itwould appear from remarks upon
thesubject inDr.Denys’ work, that live aswell
asdead bait iscommonly used:—
“Asmall piece ofhardwood, about 6in.or8in.
long, andabout three-quarters ofaninch thick, is

theendofayard oftwine isfirmly fastened, the
twine having about adozen strands justheldtogether
bysayacouple ofknots, soastoprevent thecrocodile
from biting itthrough, asthestrands simply get
between histeeth;totheother endofthistwine is
fastened asingle uncut rattan, atleast 20feet long,
which canbeonly aquarter ofaninch indiameter,
butmay withadvantage bealittle bigger; asmall
stick affixed totheendofthe line, toactasavisible
float, completes this part ofthegear. Probably a
crocodile willeatanything, butheiscertainly partial
tochicken—atleast that bait isalways successful in
theSepang river—so,having killed some sortoffowl,
thebody iscutright through thebreast lengthways
fromhead totail,andthesmall piece ofpointed hard
wood inserted, andthebirdbound upagain with string.
Next, two pieces oflightwood arenailed together,
forming asmall floating platform about afootsquare,
andonthisthefowl isplaced, raised onminiature
trestles. The small platform thusfurnished isplaced
inalikely spot near thebank, andtherattan line is
hitched over asmall branch orastake, sothat the
baitplatform may notbecarried away bythe tide.
Bythenextmorning therattan line, baitandplatform
may allhave disappeared, which probably means that
thecrocodile, having swallowed thefowl, hasgone off
with therattan intow,atugbeing sufficient toset it
free, whilst theplatform, thus released, has drifted

asecond manwitharifle.Thecrocodile hasprobably
afavourite place up-stream, sotheboatmen paddle up
onthelook-out fortherattan (which always floats),
finding itatlength close tothemangrove roots
bordering ontheriver, perhaps. Theboat-hook picks
upthefloating-stick endoftheline,and,with acouple
ofboatmen ontothisandacrocodile attheother end,
with thesmall pointed hardwood stick across his
throat, theexcitement begins. The crocodile plunges
about amidst themangrove roots under thewater, and
thenmakes arush;therattan ispaid outagain and
theboat follows;then herushes under the boat,
perhaps attheboat, whilst theline issteadily pulled
in.This sort ofthingmay lastsome time, butthe
onlything tobeafraid ofistherattan’s getting twisted
round abakau1root under water, which might
prevent acapture;otherwise, after agood deal of
playing ofarather violent nature, the continual
pulling oftherattan-holders intheboat, orhisown
aggressiveness, induces him toshow hishead above
thesurface, whereat the rifles crack, andthecrocodile
dies,though often not tillfourorfivebullets havebeen
putinto different parts ofhisbody.”2
Iwillnow proceed todescribe the religious
ceremonies which accompany thisperformance.
The following outline oftheceremonies used in
catching acrocodile who isknown tobeaman-eater,
wastaken down bymefrom themouth ofanoted
crocodile -wizard ontheLangat river. First, you
take strips ofbark ofariver-side bush ortreecalled
baru-baru (which must becutdown atasingle
stroke), and fasten them together ateachend only,

sothat theyform arope with divided (unravelled)
strands. This willform thatpartofyour tackle which
corresponds tothegut(perambut)ofafishing line,
(i.e.thepart justabove thehook), andtheadvantage
of itisthat theloose strands getbetween the
crocodile’s teeth, andprevent itfrom being bitten
through asaropewould certainly be.
Next, youtake apiece ofthebottommost rung of
ahouse-ladder (anak tangga bongsu), andsharpen it
toapoint atboth ends, soastoform across-piece
(fla/ang) such aswillbelikely tostick inthecrocodile’s
throat. Having fastened oneendofthe“gut” round
themiddle ofthecross-piece, andtheother toyour
rattan line,thelength ofwhichmaybefrom tentofifteen
fathoms orso,according tothedepth oftheriver at
thespotwhere thecrocodile issupposed tolie,you
must next cutdown ayoung tree toserve asthepole
(chanchang)towhich thefloating platform and bait
maybesubsequently attached. This polemaybeof
anykind ofwood except bamboo;sowhen youhave
found asuitable tree, takehold ofitwith the lefthand
andchop at itthrice with the right, saying acharm
asyoudoso—
“Peace bewith you,OProphet Tetap, inwhose charge isthe

Then startmaking thefloating platform orraft
(rakit)bychopping aplantain stem (anykind willdo)
intothree lengths(di-k'ratkan tiga),andthenskewering
these lengths together attheir ends soastoform a
triangle.
Intotheapex ofthistriangle firmly plant thelower
endofastrong andspringy rod,making theupper
endcurve over slightly inaforward direction(di-pas-
ang-nya kayu melentor ka-atas)and securing itin
itsposition bytwo lashings, which arecarried down
from itstipandfastened tothetwo front corners of
the triangle. Then utter thecharm and plant the
polebytheriver-side inthespotyouhave selected,
holding your breath andmaking believe thatyou
areKingSolomon(di-sifatkan kitaRaja Suleiman)as
itsinks into theground. Thecharm consists of
these lines:—
“Peace bewithyou,OProphet Khailir,
Inwhose charge isthewater;

Inwhose charge istheearth;
Pardon, King oftheSea,Deity ofMid-currents,
Iaskonly forthe ‘guilty ’(crocodiles),
Theinnocent doyou assistmetoletgo,
And drive outonly theguilty which devoured So-and-so.
Ifyoudonotdoso,you shall die,” etc.
Now prepare the bait.Todothisyoumust killa

have finished binding itupasdirected, chew some

Then hook the bait(sangkutkan umpan) ontothe
tipofthebent rod(onnoaccount tie iton,as it
must beleftfree forthecrocodile toswallow), and
having prepared thewonted accessories—including
three chews ofbetel -leaf, arichek ofginger(halia

sulah tujoh biji)—breathe(jampikan
)upon thebetel-
leaf,and attheend ofthe invocation eject the
chewed betel-leaf upon thehead ofthecock intended
forthebait.
Thecharm toberecited (which makes allusion
tothefable concerning thesupposed origin ofthe
crocodile) runs asfollows:—
“Follow inprocession, follow insuccession,

another asserting that itsdorsal ridge

V IDEAS ABOUT TOADS 305
Todream ofbeing bitten byasnake isthought to
portend success inalove affair .1
“Ahorned toad,known askatak bertandok,but
notthecommon one ofthatname (Megalophrys
nasuta,Gunther), hasaverybadreputation with the
Malays. Itissaid tolive inthejungle onthe hills,
andwherever ittakes up itsabode allthetrees and
plants around wither and die.Sopoisonous isit,that
itisdangerous even toapproach it,andtotouch orbe
bitten by itiscertain death.
“The biteofthecommon toad[Bu/o melanostictus,
Cantor) isalso said toprove fatal. That toads have
noteeth isananatomical detail thatdoes notseem to
bethought worthy ofbeing taken intoaccount.
“Thesupposed venomous properties ofthis useful
andharmless tribe have aworld -wide range. In
Shakespeare many allusions to itaremade;oneof
them, which mentions thehabit ofhibernation pos-
sessed bythose species which inhabit thecolder parts
oftheearth, says—
‘Inthepoison’d entrails throw,
Toad, thatunder coldest stone
Daysandnights hast thirty-one,
Swelter’d venom sleeping got,
Boilthou first i’thecharmed pot.’
“In another, reference ismade tothetoad-stone,
which seems toberepresented inMalayan tradition
bythepearl carried inthebodies ofthehamadryad,
thecobra, andthebungarus, thethree most deadly
snakes ofthePeninsula:—
‘Sweet aretheuses ofadversity,
Which, likethetoad, uglyandvenomous,
Wears yetaprecious jewel initshead.’

“There issome foundation offactforthepopular
belief, astoads secret anacrid fluid from the skin,
which appears todefend them from theattacks ofcar-
nivorous animals.”1
Itmaynotbeoutofplace togivehere aMalay
tradition about aspecies ofsnail:—
“Astrange superstition isattached toasmall snail
which frequents theneighbourhood ofthelimestone
hills inPerak. Itbelongs totheCyclophorides,and
isprobably anAlycceus .Among thegrass inthe
shadow ofagrazing animal these creatures aretobe
discovered, and ifoneofthem iscrushed itwillbe
found tobefullofblood, which hasbeendrawn ina
mysterious wayfrom theveins oftheanimal through
itsshadow. Where these noxious snails abound, the
cattle become emaciated andsometimes even diefrom
theconstant loss ofblood. Inthefolklore ofother
countries many parallels tothisoccur, butthey differ
ineither thebirds, bats, orvampires, whoaresupposed
topreyonthelife-blood oftheir fellows, going direct
totheanimals tosuck theblood, instead ofdoing so

Cp. the following note inSale’s
Translation oftheKordn :—
“This miracle isthus related bythe
commentators. Jesus having, atthere-
quest ofhisfollowers, asked itofGod,
aredtable immediately descended, in
their sight, between twoclouds, andwas
setbefore them, whereupon heroseup,
andhaving made theablution, prayed,
and then took offthecloth which
covered thetable, saying, Inthename
ofGod,thebestprovider offood. What
theprovisions were with which this
tablewasfurnished isamatter wherein
theexpositors arenotagreed. One
willhave them tobenine cakes of
bread andnine fishes;another, bread
and flesh;another, allsorts offood,
except flesh;another, allsorts offood
except bread and flesh;another, all
except bread and fish;another, one
fish,which hadthetaste ofallmanner
offood;andanother, fruits ofparadise,
butthemost received tradition isthat
when thetable wasuncovered, there
appeared afishready dressed, without
scales orprickly fins,dropping with
fat,having saltplaced atitsheadand
vinegar atitstail,andround itallsortsofherbs, except leeks, and fiveloaves
ofbread, ononeofwhich there were
olives, onthesecond honey, onthe
third butter, onthefourth, cheese, and
onthe fifth, dried flesh. They add
thatJesus, attherequest oftheapostles,
showed them another miracle, byre-
storing thefishtolife,andcausing its
scales and finstoreturn toit,atwhich
thestanders-by being affrighted, he
caused ittobecome asbefore;that
1300men andwomen, allafflicted
with bodily infirmities orpoverty, ate
ofthese provisions andwere satisfied,
thefishremaining whole asitwas at
first;thatthen thetable flewupto
heaven inthesight ofall;andevery
onewhohadpartaken ofthisfoodwere
delivered from their infirmities andmis-
fortunes;and that itcontinued to
descend for forty days together at
dinner-time, andstood ontheground
tillthesun declined, andwasthen
taken upintotheclouds. Some ofthe
Mohammedan writers areofopinion
that thistable didnotreally descend,
but that itwasonly aparable;but
most think thewords oftheKoran are
plain tothecontrary. Afurther tradi-
tion is,thatseveral menwere changed
intoswine fordisbelieving thismiracle,
andattributing ittomagic art;or,as
others pretend, forstealing some ofthe

fabulous circumstances arealso told

InJanuary 1897 Iwitnessed theceremony of

riceabout aninch indepth.
Next hetook abowl ofsaffron-stained rice,and
deposited about fiveportions of itinthecentre and
fourcorners ofeach tray;thenhemade asimilar dis-

thetwoseaward posts attheendofthestakes, and
emptied outtheremainder oftheparched riceupon the
water justinside the“head” ofthestakes. Then he
recited acharm, stirred thebowl ofneutralising rice-

taking thelatter outofthebowl, sprinkled, orrather
daubed itfirstupon thetwo “tide-braces”ofthe

posts next tothetide-braces, andthen delegated the
brush totwo assistants. One ofthese sprinkled the
heads ofallthe(remaining) upright posts inthesea-
ward compartment ofthe stakes, while theother
boarded thebigboat belonging tothestakes, and
sprinkled theboatand allitsgearfromstem tostern

V FISHING TABOOS 315
when Ivisited them—the spirits having, Iwas told,
thestrongest possible objection totheuseofeither.
Other “perpetual taboos”(pantang salama-lama-
nya) are tobathe without wearing abathing-cloth
(mandi telanjang),tothrow thewetbathing-cloth over
theshoulder when returning tothehouse, andtorub
one foot against theother(gosok sahtkaki dengan
lain). Sarongs, umbrellas, andshoes must never on
anypretence beworn. Imayadd that the firstpole
planted iscalled Turns Tuah (tua ?),and ifthe
response ofthespirits totheinvocation befavourable,
itisbelieved that itwillenter theground readily, asif
pulled from below. Theonlyseven-days’ taboo which
Ihave heard mentioned (though, nodoubt, there are
many others) isthescrupulous observance ofchastity.
Aboatwhich possesses aknot inthecentre ofits
keel, ortowhich thesmell offishlongadheres(p'rahu

There isalsoaregular “taboo language” usedby
thefishermen, ofwhich thefollowing areexamples:—

V PRODUCTION OFFIRE 317
(Before casting the line,achew ofbetel-leaf should
bethrown intothewater.)
Another verycommon rhyming charm would

“Swallow (lit.receive) thegutofmyline,

Ifyoutear itfrommyhands

I.PRODUCTION OFFIRE
“Procuring firebyfriction isanaccomplishment
ascommon totheMalay astotheNorth American
Indian. The process is,however, slightly different.
While thelatter resorts tocircular friction, theMalay
cuts anotch ontheconverse surface ofabamboo,
across which herapidly rubs another piece cuttoa
sharp edge.Afinepowder isrubbed away and this
ignites. Bamboo isalsoused asaflintwith tinder.
The all-pervading match, however, isalone used in
alldistricts under foreign influence.”1
The foregoing description requires tobesupple-
mented, forthemethod ofprocuring firebycircular
friction ishardly (ifatall)lesscommon among the
Malays than themethod ofcross friction. The
former process takes theform ofthewell-known
“fire-drill,” both theblock and theupright stick
being generally made ofmahang wood. The
upright stick isfrequently worked byaspecies of
“bow,” such asthatusedbycarpenters, and iskept
fromjumping outofthesocket inwhich itrevolves
1Denys, Descr. Did. ofBrit. Mai., s.v. Fire.


FIRE CHAP. 318
bymeans ofacocoa-nut shell, which ispressed down
from above. When cross friction isused, along
narrow slit isusually cut,following thegrain, inthe
convex surface ofthepiece ofbamboo, thedust
which isrubbed away falling through itandgradually
forming alittle pilewhich presently ignites. Itis
hardly necessary tocutanotch forthecross-piece,
asagroove isvery quickly wornwhen the friction
isstarted. Aspecies offire -syringe has also, I
believe, been collected byMr.L.Wray inPerak.
2.FIRECHARMS
Inprocuring firebycircular orcross friction the
performer willoften say,bywayofacharm—
“TheMouse-deer asks forFire1
Tosinge hismother-in-law’s feathers.”
The“mouse-deers mother-in-law” isthename ofa
small bird,which issaid tohave verygayplumage of
fivecolours and toresemble thegreen pigeon(punei)
inshape, andtheexplanation ofthischarm issaid
tobethat inthedays ofKing Solomon, when both
themouse-deer and hismother-in-law wore their
human forms, theMouse -deer was greatly annoyed
bytheconduct ofhismother-in-law, whokept dan-
cing infront ofhim ashewent.Aquarrel ensued,2
asthe result ofwhich they were both transformed
into theshapes which theynow respectively bear;
butthemother-in-law hasnotyetabandoned her
exasperating tactics, andmay still often beseen
1PHandok minta’apiycursed hismother-in-law, saying:—

V IDEAS ABOUT FIRE 319
tantalising theMouse-deer byhopping, infront ofit
asitgoes along.
There are stillsome traces oftheinfluence of
animistic ideas inthat part ofMalay folklore which
isconcerned with fire. Ifaninflammable object,
such aswood, fallsbyaccident into the fire,astick
must beused inextracting it,andthestick left, as
asubstitute, initsplace.
The hearth-fire (apidapor) must never bestepped
over (di-langkah-nya), normust therice-pot which
stands upon it,asinthelatter case theperson who
does sowillbe“cursed bytheRice.”
Both fireandsmoke (fumigation) areagood deal
used bytheMalays forpurposes ofceremonial puri-
fication, butthedetails ofsuch rites cannot becon-
veniently discussed except inconnection with the
complete ceremonies ofwhich theyform apart;they
willaccordingly befound under such headings as
Birth, Adolescence, Marriage, Medicine, andFunerals .1

Wenowcome tothe spirits which arebelieved to
attack bothwomen andchildren atchildbirth.
These arefour innumber :theBajang, which
generally takes theform ofapole-cat(musang)and
disturbs thehousehold bymewing likeagreat cat;
theLangsuir, which takes theform ofanowlwith
long claws, which sitsandhoots upon theroof-tree;
thePontianak orMati-anak, which, aswillbeseen
presently, isalso anight-owl, and issupposed tobe
achild oftheLangsuir, andthePenanggalan, which
isbelieved toresemble atrunkless human head with
thesacofthestomach attached to it,andwhich flies
about seeking foranopportunity ofsucking theblood
ofinfants.
With theabove areoften associated thePolong,
which isdescribed asadiminutive but malicious
species ofbottle -imp, and the Pelesit, which isthe
name given toakind ofgrasshopper (orcricket ?),
butthese latter, though often associated with the
regular birth-spirits, partake also ofthecharacter of

Iwillnow take these spirits intheabove order.
The Bajang, as Ihave said, isgenerally described
astaking theform ofapole-cat(musang),but it
appears tobeoccasionally confused with the Pelesit.
Thus aMalay magician once toldmethattheBajang
took theform ofahouse-cricket, and thatwhen thus
embodied itmaybekeptbyaman, asthePelesit
maybekeptbyawoman. This statement, however,
must notbeaccepted without due reserve, and it
maybetaken asacertainty thattheusual conception
oftheBajang’s embodiment isapole-cat .2
Ineed hardly saythat itisconsidered verydanger-
oustochildren, who aresometimes provided with a
sortofarmlet ofblack silkthreads, called a“bajang
bracelet ”(glang bajang),which, itissupposed, will
protect them against it.Ontheopposite page will

itwasexplained tomebyaMalay,
withwhom Idiscussed thesubject at
leisure, that apart from the spirits
which areanobject ofreverence, and
which when treated withproper defer-
ence areusually beneficent, there are
avariety ofothers. Tobegin with,
spirits (theword usedonthisoccasion
washantu)
areofatleasttwokinds—
wild ones, whose normal habitat isthe
jungle, andthose that are,sotosay,
domesticated. The latter, which seem
tocorrespond towhat inWestern
magic arecalled‘familiars,’ vary in
character with their owners orthe
persons towhom they areattached.
Thus inthisparticular village ofBukit
Senggeh, afewyears ago, therewasa
good dealofalarm onaccount ofthe
arrival oftwoorthree strangers believed
tobeofbad character, whowere sup-
posed tokeep afamiliar spirit ofapeculiarly malignant disposition, which
was inthehabit ofattacking people in
their sleep bythrottling them. One
ortwocases ofthiskind occurred, and
itwasseriously suggested that Ishould
make thematter thesubject ofama-
gisterial inquiry, which, however, Idid
notfind itnecessary todo.Butthe
familiar spirits arebynomeans neces-
sarily evil The chief point of
importance istokeep these wild spirits
intheir proper place, viz.thejungle,
and toprevent them taking uptheir
abode inthevillages. For thisreason
charms arehungupattheborders of
thevillages, andwhenever awild spirit
breaks bounds andencroaches onhuman
habitations itisnecessary togethim
turned out.”—Blagden inJ.R.A.S.,

beseen aremarkable drawing1(ofwhich afacsimile
ishere given), which appears torepresent theoutline
ofaBajang, “scripturally”modified toserve asa
counter-charm against theBajang itself .2
The following account oftheBajang isbySir
Frank Swettenham:—
“Some one inthevillage falls illofacomplaint
thesymptoms ofwhich areunusual;theremaybe
convulsions, unconsciousness, ordelirium, possibly for
some days together orwith intervals between the
attacks. The relatives will call inanative doctor,
and ather(she isusually anancient female) sug-
gestion, orwithout it,animpression will arise that
thepatient isthevictim ofabajang. Such anim-
pression quickly develops into certainty, andany
trifle willsuggest theowner ofthe evil spirit. One
method ofverifying thissuspicion istowait tillthe
patient isinastate ofdelirium, andthen toquestion
him orherastowho istheauthor ofthetrouble.
This should bedonebysome independent person of
authority, who issupposed tobeable toascertain
thetruth.
1This‘‘Bajang ”was copied for
meby’CheSam (formany years
Malay munshi and clerk atKuala
Lumpur, Selangor), from theoriginal
which wasposted uponthedoor of
oneofhisneighbours. The outlines
ofthefigure aremade upfrom varying
combinations ofthenames “Allah,”
“Muhammad,”“‘Ali,” etc., inthe
Arabic character.
2“Inallparts ofthePeninsula
theBajang issaid tobeofthe
male gender,while theLangsuir is
supposed tobeafemale. Itisusually
believed byMalays thattheBajang is
merely amalignant spirit which haunts
mankind, andwhose presence foretells
disaster. InPerak andsome otherparts ofthePeninsula, however, the
Bajang isregarded asone ofthe
several kinds ofdemons which, the
Malays hold, canbeenslaved byman
andbecome hisfamiliar spirit. Such
familiars, itisbelieved, arehanded
down incertain families asheirlooms.
Themaster ofthefamiliar issaid to

which isclosed byastopper made
from theleaves oftheCotyledon lacini-
ata,theDaun chekar bebek, orDaun

bytheMalays. Both thecaseand

magic artsbefore theycanbeemployed
inthisway. The familiar isfedwith


VI DETECTION OFSORCERY 323
“Afurther andconvincing proof isthen tocall
ina‘Pawang' skilled indealing with wizards (in
Malay countries they areusually men), and ifhe
knows hisbusiness hispower issuch thathewill
place thesorcerer inoneroom, and, while hein
another scrapes aniron vessel with arazor, the
culprits hair will fall offasthough therazor had
been applied tohishead instead oftothevessel!
That issupposing heistheculprit;ifnot,ofcourse
hewillpassthrough theordeal without damage.
“Ihave been assured that theshaving process is
soefficacious that, asthevessel represents thehead
oftheperson standing his trial,wherever itisscraped
thewizard’s hair will falloffinacorresponding spot.
Itmight besupposed thatunder these circumstances
theaccused isreasonably safe, but this testofguilt
isnotalways employed. What more commonly
happens isthatwhen several cases ofunexplained
sickness have occurred inavillage, with possibly one
ortwodeaths, thepeople oftheplace lodge aformal
complaint against thesupposed author ofthese ills,
anddesire thathebepunished.
“Before theadvent ofBritish influence itwasthe
practice tokillthewizard orwitch whose guilthad
been established toMalay satisfaction, andsuch execu-
tionswere carried outnotmany years ago.
“Iremember acase inPerak lessthan tenyears
ago,when thepeople ofanup-river village accused
aman ofkeeping abajang,andthepresent Sultan,
eggs and milk. When itsmaster which canonly becured bymagic
wishes tomake useofithesends it agencies. IftheBajang isneglected

whowasthen theprincipal Malay judge intheState,
toldthem hewould severely punish thebajang ifthey
would produce it.They wentaway hardly satisfied,
andshortly aftermade aunited representation tothe
effect that iftheperson suspected were allowed to
remain intheir midst theywould killhim. Before
anything could bedone theyputhim, hisfamily, and
effects onaraftand started themdown the river.
Ontheir arrival atKuala Kangsar themanwasgiven
anisolated huttolive in,butnotlong afterwards he
disappeared.
“The hereditary bajang comes likeother evils,
theunsought heritage ofadissolute ancestry, butthe
acquired bajang isusually obtained from thenewly-
buried body ofastillborn child, which issupposed
tobetheabiding-place ofafamiliar spirit until lured
therefrom bythesolicitations ofsome onewho, at
dead ofnight, stands over thegrave andbypotent
incantations persuades thebajang tocome forth.”1
“It isallvery well fortheKedah ladies tosacrifice
theirshadows toobtain possession ofapelsit, leaders
ofsociety must beinthefashion atany cost;but
there areplenty ofpeople living inPerak whohave
seenmore than oneancient Malay dame taken out
into the river and, despite her protestations, her
tears, and entreaties, have watched her,withhands
and feet tied, putinto thewater andslowly pushed
down outofsight bymeans ofalong pole with a
fork atoneendwhich fitted onherneck. Those
whohave witnessed these executions have nodoubt
ofthejustice ofthepunishment, andnotuncommonly
add that aftertwoorthree examples hadbeenmade

torments ofthebajang. Ihave alsobeen assured
that thebajang,intheshape ofalizard, hasbeen
seen toissuefrom thedrowning person’s nose. That
statement nodoubt ismade ontheauthority ofthose
whocondemned andexecuted thevictim.”1
The popular superstition about theLangsuir is
thusdescribed bySirWilliam Maxwell:—
“Ifawoman dies inchildbirth, either before
delivery orafter thebirth ofachild, andbefore the
forty days ofuncleanness have expired, she ispopu-
larly supposed tobecome alangsuyar,aflying
demon ofthenature ofthe‘white lady’ or‘banshee.’
Toprevent thisaquantity ofglass beads areput in
themouth ofthecorpse, ahen’s egg isputunder
each arm-pit, andneedles areplaced inthepalms of
thehands. Itisbelieved that ifthis isdone the
deadwoman cannot become alangsuyar,asshe
cannot open hermouth toshriek(ngilai)orwave
herarms aswings, oropen andshut herhands to
assist herflight.”2
The superstitions about theLangsuir, however,
donotend here, forwith regard toitsorigin the
Selangor Malays tellthefollowing story:—
The original Langsuir (whose embodiment is
supposed tobeakind ofnight-owl) isdescribed as
being awoman ofdazzling beauty, whodiedfrom the
shock ofhearing thatherchild was stillborn, andhad
taken theshape ofthePontianak .3Onhearing this

terrible news, she “clapped herhands,” andwithout
further warning “flew whinnying away toatree,
upon which sheperched.” Shemay beknown by
herrobe ofgreen, byhertapering nails ofextraordinary
length (amark ofbeauty), andbythelong jetblack
tresses which sheallows tofalldown toherankles—
only, alas
!(forthetruth must betold) inorder to
conceal thehole intheback ofherneckthrough which
shesucks theblood ofchildren !These vampire-like
proclivities ofhersmay, however, besuccessfully com-
bated iftherightmeans areadopted, for ifyouare
able tocatch her, cutshort her nails andluxuriant
tresses, andstuffthem intothehole inherneck, she
willbecome tame andindistinguishable from anordi-
narywoman, remaining soforyears. Cases havebeen
known, indeed, inwhich shehasbecome awifeand
amother, until shewasallowed todance atavillage
merry-making, when she atonce reverted toher
ghostly form, andflew offinto thedarkandgloomy
forest fromwhence shecame.
Intheir wild state, aMalay once informed me,
these woman-vampires areexceedingly fond offish,
andonce andagainmaybeseen “sitting incrowds
onthe fishing -stakes atthe river mouth awaiting
anopportunity tosteal thefish.” However thatmay
be, itseems curiously inkeeping with thefollowing
charm for“laying”aLangsuir:—
“Oyemosquito-fry attheriver’s mouth
When yetagreatway off,yearesharp ofeye,
When near, yearehard ofheart.
When therock intheground opens ofitself
Then (andthen only) beemboldened thehearts ofmyfoesand
opponents !
When thecorpse intheground opens ofitself
Then (andthen only) beemboldened thehearts ofmyfoesand

The “mosquito-fry attherivers mouth”inthe first

ThePontianak (orMati-anak), ashasalready been
said, isthestillborn child oftheLangsuir, and its
embodiment islikethatofitsmother, akind ofnight-

ofthese spirits which rises tothedignity ofbeing
addressed asa“Jin”or“Genie,” asappears from the
charms which areused forlaying it.Thuswefind in
acommon charm:—
“OPontianak theStillborn,
Mayyoubestruck deadbythesoilfrom thegrave-mound.
Thus (we) cutthebamboo-joints, thelongandtheshort,
Tocook therein theliver oftheJin(Demon) Pontianak.

ThePenanggalan isasort ofmonstrous vampire
which delights insucking theblood ofchildren. The

vat,asked her, “What areyoudoing there ?”To
thisthewoman replied, “What business haveyouto

escape, and intheexcitement ofthemoment, kicked
herownchinwithsuch force that theskin splitround
herneck, andherhead (with thesacofthestomach
depending from it)actually became separated from the
trunk, andflew offtoperch upon thenearest tree.
Ever since then shehasexisted asaspirit ofevil,
sitting ontheroof-tree whinnying(mengilai)whenever
achild isborn inthehouse, ortrying toforce herway
upthrough theflooronwhich thechild lies, inorder
todrink itsblood .1

means confined toasingle “role”asthepreceding
oneshave been.
The Polong resembles anexceedingly diminu-
tivefemale figure ormannikin, being inpoint ofsize
about asbigasthetopjoint ofthe little finger. It
will flythrough the airtowherever itistold to
go,but isalways preceded by itspetorplaything
(pemainan),the Pelesit, which, ashasalready been
said,appears tobeaspecies ofhouse-cricket. When-
ever thePolong wishes toenter(di-rasoki)anew
victim, itsends thePelesit onbefore it,andassoon as
thelatter, “flying inaheadlong fashion (menelentang
menjerongkong ),”hasentered itsvictim’s body, which
itusually does /#f/-foremost, andbegins tochirp, the
Polong follows. Itisgenerally hidden away outside
thehouse by itsowner(Jinjangan :),and fedwith
blood pricked from thefinger. Thedescription usually
given ofaPolong tallies curiously with theMalay
definition ofthesoul .1
The lastofthese spirits, the Pelesit (orhouse-
forthepenanggalan has, itseems, a
dread ofthorns inwhich herintestines
mayhappen togetcaught. Itissaid
that apenanggalan once came toa
man’s house inthemiddle ofthenight

were caught insome thorns near the
hedge, andshehad toremain there
until daylight, when thepeople saw
andkilled her.

ofthis istosoak theintestines in,for
when they issue forth from thebody

from the tipofthefourth finger which they prick for

present noreceptacles areused, theusual accessories
ofthebetel-chewing ceremony being deposited in
thecherana itself. The Bidan, onreceiving the
cherana,andcharming thecontents, inverts it,pour-
ingout(di-chorahkan)itscontents upon thefloor, and
taking omens forthecoming event from themanner
inwhich they fall .1Shethencommences tochew the
betel-leaf, andwhen shehastaken asmuch asshe
requires, she generally performs some species of
divination(tengo dalam petua)inorder toascertain
thenature ofthechild’s horoscope. This object may
beachieved inseveral ways;eg.byastrological
calculations;bycasting up{palak orfalakiah)the
numerical values oftheletters ofboth parents’ names,

thespot selected,1while justexactly beneath itunder
thefloor ofthehouse (which israised onpiles like
theoldSwiss lake-dwellings) arefastened abunch of
leaves oftheprickly pandanus, the“acid”egg-plant,2
andalekar jantan, which isakind ofrattan stand
used forMalay cooking-pots. The leaves ofthese
plants areusedbecause itisthought that their thorns
willprickanyevil spirit3which tries togetatthechild
from below, whilst thecircular cooking-pot stand will

justunder the rafters, isspread acasting-net(jala),
together with abunch ofleaves ofthereddracaena

Abigtray(talam)isnow filled with ameasure of
uncooked husked rice(b'ras sa-gontang),andcovered

VI PURIFICATION AFTER BIRTH335
leaves oflengkuas, halict, kunyit frits,kunyit
,pandan
bau,areca-palm blossom, andthedried leaves(keron-
song orkeresek)ofthepisang k'lat. This hastobe
repeated (every?)morning andevening. Inmost
places thenew-born infant is,ashasbeen said, laid
upon amatandformally adopted bythefather, who
breathes intothechild’s ear1asortofMuhammadan
prayer orformula, which iscalled bang inthecase
ofaboy,andkamat inthecase ofagirl. After
purification thechild isswaddled inasortofpapoose;
aninner bandage(barut)isswathed round thechild’s
waist, andabroad clothband (kain lampin) iswound
round itsbodyfrom theknees tothebreast, afterwhich
theouter bandage(kain bedong) iswound round the
child’s body from thefeettotheshoulder, and isworn
continually until thechild isthree orfourmonths old,
or,inMalay parlance, until hehaslearned tocrawl
(tahu meniarap). This contrivance, itisalleged, pre-
vents thechild from starting andstraining itsmuscles.
Over the child’s mat issuspended asort ofsmall
conical mosquito-net (kain bochok),theupper endof
which isgenerally stitched(di-semat)orpinned onto
thetopoftheparent’s mosquito curtain, andwhich is
intended toprotect thechild from anystray mosquito
orsandfly which mayhave found itsway into the
bigger netusedbyhisparents.
1Vide McNair, Perak and the
Malays, p.231. “Thechildren ofthe
Malays arereceived intotheworld quite
inreligious form, prayer being said,
and theAzan orAllah Alcbar pro-
nounced bythefather with his lips
close tothetender infant’s ear.” The
bang,according to’Che Sam, a
Malay pandit ofKuala Lumpor, ran
somewhat asfollows:—
Allahu Akbar

Rasul Allah (twice), hei‘Ali al-saleh

Nextcomes theceremony ofmarking theforehead
(ckonting muka),which issupposed tokeep thechild
from starting and straining itself(>jangan terkejut ter-
kekau), andfrom convulsions
(sawan),andatthesame
time topreserve itfrom evil spirits. The following
arethedirections:—Take chips ofwood from thethin
end(kapala ?)ofthethreshold, from thesteps ofthe
house-ladder, andfrom thehouse furniture, together
with acoat(kesip)ofgarlic, acoatofanonion, assa-
fcetida, arattan cooking-pot stand, and fibrefrom the
“monkey-face”ofanunfertile cocoa-nut(tampo niyor
jantan). Burn allthese articles together, collect the
ashes, andmixthem bymeans ofthefore-finger with
alittle “betel- water.”
Now repeat theproper charm,1dipthefinger in
themixture, andmark thecentre ofthechild’s fore-
head, ifaboywith asignresembling what iscalled a
bench mark v,ifagirlwithaplain cross -f,andatthe
same time putsmall daubs onthenose, cheeks, chin,
andshoulders. Then mark themother with aline
drawn from breast tobreast(pangkah susu) and a
daubontheendofthenose(cholek hidong). Ifyou
dothisproperly, aLangat Malay informed me,the
EvilOne willtakemother andchild forhisown wife
andchild(who aresupposed tobesimilarly marked)
and willconsequently refrain fromharming them!
Inaddition totheabove, ifthechild isagirl,her
eyebrows areshaved andacurve drawn intheir place,
extending from theroot ofthenose totheear (di-
pantiskan bentoktajiderimuka sampei pelipis ).The
mixture used formarking these curves consists of
manjakani mixed withmilkfrom themother’s breast.
Another most curious custom which recalls aparallel

VI COMPRESSING THEHEAD 337
custom among North American Indians, isocca-
sionally resorted toforthepurpose ofaltering the
shape ofthechild’s head. When itisconsidered too
long (terlampau panjang), asmall tightly-fitting “yam
leafcap” (songko daun fcladi), consisting ofseven
thicknesses ofcalladium (yam) leaves isused tocom-
press it.This operation issupposed toshorten the
child’s skull, andtheperson who fits itontothechild’s
head uses thewords—“Muhammad, short beyour
head” inthecase ofaboy,and “Fatimah, short be
yourhead”inthecaseofagirl.
Nowcomes theceremony ofadministering tothe
infant what iscalled the“mouth-opener” (lit.“mouth-
splitter,” pemd lahmulut);first, you take agreen
cocoa-nut (niyor sungkoran),split itinhalves (di-bVa/i
niyor),puta“grain”ofsaltinside one-half oftheshell
(di-buboh garam sa-buku),andgive ittothechild to
drink, counting uptoseven, and putting ittothe
child’s mouth attheword seven (letakkan dimulut-
nya). Then repeat theceremony, substituting asam
(tamarinds?) forthe salt. Finally, take agold ring,
andafterrubbing itagainst theinside ofthecocoa-nut
(cholek di-dalam niyor), lay itupon thechild’s lips,
(letakkan dibibir-nya),saying“Bismillah,” etc.Do
thesame with asilver andamalgam (gold and silver)
ring respectively, andtheceremony willbeatanend.
Imay note, inpassing, that itisinallusion tothe
above ceremony thatyou willsometimes hear oldmen
say“It’snotthe firsttime Itasted salt, Ididsoever
since Iwas firstputintomyswinging-cot ”(akumakan
garam dahulu, deripada tatkala naik buayan).
Sometimes alittle“rock” sugar(gula batu)isadded
tomake the“mouth-opener”more palatable.

which continues until itisweaned bytheapplication

Intherice-jar (buyong Uras)during this period, a

When thechild hasbeen bathed, itisfumigated,

Once inevery four hours the child should be
bathed with cold water, inorder that itmaybekept
“cool.” This custom, Iwas told, isdiametrically
opposite tothatwhich obtains atMalacca, where the
child isbathed asrarely aspossible. Thecustom
followed inSelangor issaid toprevent thechild from
getting asoremouth(.guam).
Forthe firsttwomonths orso,whenever thechild
isbathed, itisrubbed over with apaste obtained by
mixing powdered ricewith thepowder obtained from
aredstone called batu kawi. This stone, which is
saidbysome Malays totake itsname from theIsland
ofLangkawi, isthought topossess astringent (k'lat)
qualities, and isused byMalay women toimprove
their skin. Before usethepaste isfumigated with the
smoke ofburning eagle- wood, sandal-wood, andincense,
after which the liquid, which issaid toresemble
red ink, isapplied totheskin, andthenwashed off,
nodoubt, with lime-juice intheordinary way.
Inthecoldwater which isused forbathing the
child aredeposited abigiron nail (asa“symbol of
iron ”),“candle-nuts”andcockle-shells(kulit k'rang),
towhich some Malays addakind ofparasite called
sibernas (i.e.Well- Filled Out, aword applied to
children whoare fat,instead ofthewordgemok,which
isconsidered unlucky) andanother parasite called
sadingin orsidingin,the“Cold”one.
After bathing, theBidan should perform the
ceremony called sembor sirih,which consists inthe


VI NAMING THECHILD 34i
ejecting ofbetel-leaf (mixed with other ingredients)
outofhermouth ontothepitofthechild’s stomach,
theingredients being pounded leaves ofthebunglei,
chekor,andjerangau,andchips ofbrazil-wood, ebony,
andsugar -palm twigs(segar kabong);tothese are
sometimes added small portions ofthe“Rough”
bamboo(buluh kasap\ ofthebemban balu, andof
the leaf-cases oftheareca-palm (either upih b'lah
batang orupih sarong).
The child isgenerally named within the firstweek,
but Ihave notyetheard ofanyspecial ceremony con-
nected with thenaming, though itismost probably
considered asareligious act.Thename isevidently
considered ofsome importance, for ifthechildhappens
toget illdirectly after thenaming, itissometimes
re-adopted (temporarily) byathird party, whogives it
adifferent name. When thishappens aspecies of
bracelets andanklets made ofblack cloth areputupon
thechild’s wrists andankles, theceremony being called
tumpang sayang.
Afewdays laterthechild’s head isshaved, andhis
nails cutforthe first time. Fortheformer process a
redlather ismanufactured from fine rice-flour mixed
withgambier, lime,and betel-leaf. Some people have
thechild’s head shaved clean, others leave thecentral

The floor having been smeared with rice-cosmetic
(bedak)(such astheMalays use forthebathing
ceremony), itiswell scratched bytheclaws ofa
fowl, which iscaught (andwashed) forthepurpose,
andthen held over the floor and forced todothe
scratching required of it.The cosmetic isthen
removed(di-langir)bymeans oflime-juice (again as
inthebathing ceremony) and thehearth -fire is
changed. TheBidan now receives herpay, usually
getting incash fortheeldest child $4.40 (insome
places $5.40), forthesecond, $3.40, the third, $2.40,
andforthefourth, and allsubsequent children, $1.40;
unless she ishastily summoned(bidan tareU) andno
engagement (menempak) hasbeen made, inwhich
caseshemaydemand half abhara ($11). Besides
thissomewhat meagre remuneration, however, she
receives from thewell-to-do (atthe floor-washing
ceremony) such presents ascast -offclothes (kain
bekas tuboh),abowl ofsaffron rice, abowl ofthe
rice-cosmetic andlimes(bedak limau),andaplatter
ofbetel -leaf, with accessories(cherana sirik).
Though theremuneration mayappear small, itwas,
nevertheless, sure;asinformer days anunwritten
lawallowed her totake thechild and“cry itfor
sale” (idi-jaja)round thecountry, should her fee
remain unpaid.
Before concluding thepresent subject itwillbe
necessary todescribe certain specific injunctions and
taboos which form animportant part ofthevast
body ofMalay customs which centre specially round
thebirth ofchildren.
Before thechild isborn thefather hastobemore
than usually circumspect withregard towhat hedoes,
asanyuntoward actonhispartwould assuredly have


VI INFRINGEMENT OFTABOOS 349
aprejudicial effect onthe child, andcause abirth-
mark oreven actual deformity, anysuch affection
being called kenan. Inacasewhich came tomy
notice thesonwasborn withonly athumb, forefinger,
and little finger onthe lefthand, andagreat toeon
the left foot, therestofthefingers andtoesonthe
leftsidebeing wanting. This, Iwas told,wasdueto
thefactthatthefather violated thistaboo bygoing to
thefishing-stakes onedayand killing acrabbychop-
ping atitwith acutlass.
Informer days during thisperiod itwas“taboo”
(pantang) forthefather tocutthethroat ofabuffalo
oreven ofafowl;or,infact, totake the lifeofany
animal whatever—atrace nodoubt ofIndian influ-
ences.AMalay toldmeonce that hisson,soon
after birth, was afflicted with agreat obstruction of
breathing, butthatwhen themedicine-man (Pawang)
declared (after “diagnosing”thecase) that thechild
was suffering from a“fish-affection ”(kenan ikan), he
remembered thathehadknocked onthehead an
extraordinary number offishwhich hehadcaught
ontheveryday that hissonwas born. Hethere-
fore,bytheadvice ofthemedicine -man, gave the
child apotion made frompounded fishbones, andan
immediate andpermanent recovery wastheresult.
Such affections asthose described are classified
bytheMalays according tothekind ofinfluence
which issupposed tohave produced them. Thus
theunoffending victim may beeither fish -struck
(kenan ikan), asdescribed above, ape-struck (kenan
b'rok), dog-struck (kenan anjing),crab-struck (kenan
ketam),and soforth, itbeing maintained that in
every case thechild either displays some physical
deformity, causing aresemblance totheanimal by


350 BIRTH CEREMONIES CHAP.
which itwas affected, orelse(andmore commonly)
unconsciously imitates itsactions orits“voice.”
Another interesting custom was that the father
was stringently forbidden tocuthishair until after
thebirth ofthechild.
The following passage bearing onthesubject is
taken from SirW.E.Maxwell’s article onthe“Folk-
loreoftheMalays”
:1—
“Inselecting timber fortheuprights ofaMalay
house caremust betaken toreject anylogwhich
isindented bythepressure ofany parasitic creeper
which mayhavewound round itwhen itwasaliving
tree.Alogsomarked, ifused inbuilding ahouse,
willexercise anunfavourable influence inchildbirth,
protracting delivery and endangering the lives of

VI PRECAUTIONS AGAINST DEMONS 351
great extent toSelangor, butwithafewdiscrepancies.
Thus ahouse-post indented byacreeper isgenerally
avoided inSelangor foradifferent reason, viz.that it
issupposed tobring snakes intothehouse.
“Dividing thehouse,” however, isgenerally con-
sidered animportant birth -taboo inSelangor, the
threatened penalty for itsnon -observance being
averted bycompelling theguilty party tosubmit tothe
unpleasant ceremony called sembor ayer,amember
ofthefamily being required toeject(sembor)amouth-
fulofwater upon thesmall oftheculprit’s back.
InSelangor, again, aguest must staythree nights
(not two) inthehouse, hisdeparture onthe first or
second night being called “Insulting theNight”
(menjolok malawi). Toavert theevilconsequences of
such anact,fumigation(jvabun-rabun)
isresorted to,
the“recipe” for itrunning asfollows:—“Take assa-
fcetida, sulphur, kunyit t'rus (an evil-smelling root),
onion skins, dried areca-nut husk, lemon-grass leaves,
andanoldmat orcloth, burn them, andleave the
ashes forabout anhour atsunset onthefloor ofthe
passage infront ofthedoor.” That asensible and
self-respecting“demon”should avoid ahouse where
such anunconscionable odour israised isnotinthe
least surprising !
Intheevent ofaneclipse thecustoms ofthetwo
sister States appear tobenearly identical;theonly
difference being that inSelangor thewoman isplaced
inthedoorway (inthemoonlight asfaraspossible),
and isfurnished with thebasket-work stand ofacook-
ingpot,aswellasawooden rice-spoon, theformer asa
trap tocatch anyunwary demon whomaybesofoolish

rattan binding ofthespoon (which must, ofcourse, be
oftheorthodox Malay pattern) willunwind itselfand
entangle theassailant”inthecaseofanyrealdanger.
Finally, theBidan must bepresent to“massage”the
woman, andrepeat thenecessary charms.
From thefollowing passage itwould appear that
thecorresponding Pahang custom does notmaterially
differ from thatofPerak andSelangor:—
“Butduring theperiod thattheMoon’s fatehung
inthebalance, Selema hassuffered many things. She
hasbeen seated motionless inthefireplace under the
tray-like shelf, which hangs from thelow rafters,
trembling with terror of—sheknows notwhat. The
little basket-work stand, onwhich thehotrice-pot is
wont torest, iswornonherhead asacap,and inher
girdle thelongwooden rice-spoon isstuck dagger-wise.
Neither shenorUmat know why these things are
done, buttheynever dream ofquestioning their neces-
sity. Itisthecustom. Themen ofolden dayshave
decreed thatwomen with child should dothese things
when theMoon isintrouble, andtheconsequences of
neglect aretooterrible toberisked;soSelema and
Umat actaccording totheir simple faith.”1

VI CEREMONIAL HAIR-CUTTING 353
Thefollowing isadescription oftheriteoftonsure
(berchukor), atwhich Iwaspresent inperson:—
“Some timeago (in1897)Ireceived, through one
ofmylocalMalay headmen, aninvitation toattend a
tonsure ceremony.
“When Iarrived (about two p.m.), incompany of
theheadman referred to,theusual dancing andKoran-
chanting wasproceeding intheouter chamber or
verandah, which wasdecked outfortheoccasion with
theusual brilliantly coloured ceiling-cloth andstriped
wall-tapestry. After ashort interval wewere invited
toenter aninner room, where anumber ofMalays of
bothsexes were awaiting theperformance ofthe rite.
The first thing, however, thatcaught theeyewasa
gracefully-draped figure standing withshrouded head,
andwith itsback tothecompany, upon thelowest
stepofthedais(grei),which hadbeen erected with
aview totheprospective wedding ceremony. This
was the bride.Adark-coloured veil,thrown over
herhead and shoulders, allowed seven luxuriant
tresses ofherwonderful raven -black hair toescape
and rolldown below herwaist, aringofprecious metal
being attached totheend ofeach tress. Close to
thebride, andready tosupport her,should sherequire
it,inhermotherly arms, stood the(onsuch occasions)
familiar figure oftheDuenna (Mak Inang\ whose
duty, however, inthepresent instance wasconfined
totaking the lefthand ofthebride between herown,
andsupporting itinahorizontal position whilst each
oftheseven Representatives [orang waris)1
inturn
was sprinkling itwith the‘Neutralising Rice-
paste’[tepong tawar) bymeans oftheusual bunch

sentative members ofthefamily.

orbrush ofleaves. Alittle infront ofthis pair
stood ayouth supporting inhishands anunhusked
cocoa-nut shell. Thecrown ofthiscocoa-nut had
been removed, andtheedges atthetopcutinsuch
away astoform achevroned or‘dog-tooth’border.
Upon theindentations ofthisrimwasdeposited a
necklace, andalarge pair ofscissors about thesize
ofatailor’s shears were stuck point downwards in
therim.The cocoa-nut itselfwasperhaps half-filled
with its‘milk.’ Close tothisyouth stood another,
supporting one oftheusual circular brass trays
(with high sides) containing alltheordinary acces-
sories ofthetepong tawar ceremony, i.e.abowl of
rice-paste, abrush ofleaves, parched rice,washed
saffron-stained rice,andbenzoin orincense.
“Iwasnow requested toopen theproceedings,
butatmyexpress desire thePenghulu (Malay head-
man) didsoforme, first scattering several handfuls
(ofthedifferent sorts ofrice) over the bride, and
then sprinkling therice-paste upon thepalm ofher
lefthand, which washeldouttoreceive itasdescribed
above. The sprinkling over, hetook thescissors and
with great deliberation severed theendofthe first
lock,which wasmade tofallwith alittle splash, and
with thering attached to it,into thecocoa-nut with
the‘dog-tooth’border.
“Five other waris (Representatives) andmyself
followed suit,theseven tresses with therings attached
tothem being allreceived inthecocoa-nut asdescribed.
“Achild oftheageofabout twoorthree years
underwent thetonsure atthesame time, each ofthe
Representatives, after severing thebride’s lock, snip-
ping offaportion ofthechild’s hair. The childwas
inarmsandwasnotveiled, butwore ashoulder-cloth

(bidak)thrown over hisshoulder. Attheconclusion
oftheceremony we lefttheroom, andtheKoran-
chanting wasresumed andcontinued until thearrival
ofthebridegroom inprocession (atabout five p.m.),
when thebride andbridegroom went through the
ceremony ofbeing‘seated sidebyside’
(bersanding),
andthebusiness ofthedaywasconcluded.
“The cocoa-nut containing thesevered tresses and
rings iscarried tothefoot ofabarren fruit-tree (e.g.
apomegranate-tree), when therings areextracted and
thewater (with thesevered locks) poured outatthe
tree’s foot, thebelief being that thisproceeding will
make thetree asluxuriant asthehairoftheperson
shorn,avery clear example of‘sympathetic magic.’
Iftheparents arepoor, thecocoa-nut isgenerally
turned upside down and leftthere;but ifthey are
well-to-do, thelocks areusually sent toMecca in
charge ofapilgrim, who casts them onhisarrival
intothewellZemzem.”
Iwillnow describe theceremony offiling or
“sharpening” theteeth, from notes taken bymyself
during theactual ceremony (20th March, 1897).
The youth whose teeth Isaw filedmust have
been quite fifteen orsixteen years ofage,andhad
notlong before undergone the riteofcircumcision.
When Iarrived Ifound thehouse newly swept and
clean, and alltheaccessories oftheceremony already
prepared. These latter consisted ofaround tray
(dulang)containing theusual bowl ofrice -paste
(tepong tawar\ with thebrush ofleaves,1three cups
(containing different sorts ofrice), anegg,2three rings

sisted ofleaves ofthesap^noh,pttlut- ribu (akind ofcreeper).
pulut,sapanggil,sambau dara,and2Into thisegg, itissupposed, all


356 ADOLESCENCE CHAP.
ofprecious metals (gold, silver, andamalgam), a
couple oflimes, andtwosmall files (towhich asmall
tooth-saw andtwosmall whetstones should beadded).1
Theceremony nowcommences :thetooth -filer
(Pawang gigi) first scatters thethree sorts ofriceand
sprinkles thetepong tawar upon hisinstruments,
etc.,repeating theproper charm2atthesame time;
thepatient meanwhile, andthroughout theoperation,
reclining upon hisback onthe floor with hishead
resting onapillow. Next thePawang, sitting
beside thepatient, “touches” thepatient’s teeth, first
with each ofthethree rings ofprecious metal and
then with theegg, throwing each ofthese objects
away ashedoes so,andrepeating each time acharm
(Hu, kata Allah,d. s.b.)}which isgiven inthe
Appendix. Next heprops open (di -sengkang) the
patient’s mouth bymeans ofadried areca-nut,
andrepeats another charm(.Hei,Bismi)inorder to
destroy the “venom”ofthe steel, laying the file
upon the teeth,3and drawing itthrice across
them attheend ofthecharm. Hethen cuts
off(di-Brat)thecrowns ofthe teeth (with one
evil influences proceeding from the
teeth enter. Hence itisregarded after
theceremony assial (unlucky), and
cannot beeaten—indeed itisconsidered
“bad”(temb’lang ).
1Besides thetray containing the
articles described, there stood atone
side oftheroom what iscalled a
dulang-dulang. This consists ofa
tray fullofunhusked ricesurmounted by
atray fullofhusked riceandaroughly-
husked cocoa-nut (niyor gubalan) which
restsupon thelatter. Thepointed top
ofthecocoa-nut referred toisencircled
byahank of“Java” thread [benang
Jawa),which issaid toavert injury to
thetooth -filer’s eyes whenever, as
sometimes happens, the evilinfluence(badi) issues from the teeth. This
dulang-dulang isvalued ataquarter
ofadollar, and istaken aspart pay-
ment ofthetooth-filer’s services, orit
mayberetained bythehouseholder
when thefullfeeoffiftycents ispaid.
This dulang -dulang isthought,
moreover, todispel evil influences
(membuang sial),thehank ofyarn
being usedbythePawang towipe his
eyes should anyharm tothem accrue
from evil influences residing inthe
teeth. Such evil influences(badi),
however, canonlyaccrue when people
arehaving their teeth filed forthe first
time (orang bungaran).

ofthe files), smooths their edges(di-popar)with
oneofthewhetstones, andpolishes them i^melechek).
During thewhole ofthis part oftheperformance,
which isatrying ordeal towitness, although itis
borne with theutmost fortitude onthepart ofthe
sufferer, thelatter holds asmall mirror infront ofhis
mouth inorder tobeassured that theoperation is
progressing tohis satisfaction. When the actual
filing isover, theareca-nut isextracted, andapiece
ofcocoa-nut husk orsmall block ofpulai wood
inserted initsstead, inorder tofacilitate theproper
polishing ofthenow mutilated teeth. This latter
part oftheoperation isaccomplished bymeans of
the file,asmall piece offolded white cloth protecting
thelipsfrom injury.
Considerable interest attaches tothefiling ofthe
first tooth, onaccount oftheomens which aretaken
from theposition inwhich thecrown happens tolie
when itfalls. If,when thetooth isfiled through, the
crown adheres tothe file, itistaken asasign that
thepatient willdieathome;ifitflies offand lies
with itsedge turned upwards, thismeans, onthecon-
trary, thathewilldieabroad.
Attheconclusion oftheoperation aspecies of
poultice(ubat tasak), consisting mainly ofcooked
ginger(halia bara di-pahis-ki),which isintended to
“deaden (the feeling of)thegums”(niatikan daging
gust) isdulycharmed1andapplied tothegums of
thejawwhich happens tobeunder treatment. The
Pawang now laysonehand (the left)onthetopof
thepatients head andtheother upon theteeth of
theupper jaw,andpresses them together withashow
ofconsiderable force, making believe, as itwere, that

ADOLESCENCE CHAP. 358
heispressing thepatients upper teeth firmly intotheir
sockets. Finally, aportion ofbetel -leaf ischarmed
(with thecharm Hong sarangin, etc.)andgiven to
thepatient tochew, after which, itisasserted, all
pain immediately ceases. ThePawang thenwashes
hishands, resharpens histools, andthose present sit
down toameal ofsaffron-stained pulut rice. This
concludes theceremony fortheday, thelower jaw
being similarly treated upon asubsequent occasion.
Inthecourse ofthree suchoperations (thePawang
informed me)theteeth canbefileddown even with
thegums, inwhich casethey are, Ibelieve, insome
instances somewhat roughly plated orcased with gold.
Sometimes, however, they aremerely filed into points,
sothatthey resemble theteeth ofashark .1Very
frequently, too,they blacken them with amixture of
theempyreumatic oilofthecocoa-nut shell (baja or
grang) andkamunting (Kl. karamunting)wood,2
which isalso used forblackening theeyebrows.
These customs, however, arealready dying out in
themore civilised Malay States.
1“Both sexeshave theextraordinary
custom offiling andotherwise disfigur-
ing their teeth, which arenaturally
very white and beautiful, from the
simplicity oftheir food. For files
theymake useofsmall whetstones,
and thepatients lieontheir backs
during theoperation. Many, particu-
larly thewomen oftheLampong
country, have their teeth rubbed down
quite evenwith thegums;others have
them formed inpoints, andsome file
offnomore than theouter coatand
extremities inorder thattheymay the
better receive andretain thejetty black-
nesswithwhich theyalmost universally
adorn them. Theblack usedonthese
occasions istheempyreumatic oilofthe
cocoa -nut shell. When this isnotapplied thefiling does not,bydestroy-
ingwhatweterm theenamel, diminish
thewhiteness oftheteeth. . . .The
greatmensometimes settheirs ingold
bycasing withaplate ofthatmetal the
under row;and thisornament, con-
trasted with theblack dye, has,by
lamp orcandle light, avery splendid
effect. Itissometimes indented tothe
shape oftheteeth, butmore usually
quite plain. They donotremove it
either toeatorsleep.”—Marsden, Hist,
ofSumatra (ed.1811),pp.52>53*

alsoobtained byburning theleaves of

VI EAR-BORING 359
Whenever Imade inquiries astothereason of
thisstrange custom, Iwasinvariably told that itnot
only beautified butpreserved theteeth from theaction
ofdecay, which theMalays believe tobesetupbythe
presence ofaminute maggot orworm(ulat\ theirmost

The “Batak” Malays (aMid-Sumatran tribe,many
ofwhom have settled inKuala Langat) aresaid to
chiptheteeth oftheir children intothedesired shape
bytheuseofasmall chisel, theoperation causing such
exquisite agony thatthesufferer willnotunfrequently
leap tohisfeetwith ashriek.
Evenwhen the file isused, thework ofanunskilful
performer (who does notknow how todestroy the
“venom”ofhisinstruments) willcause thesufferer’s
face tobecompletely swollen up(bakup)foralong
period subsequent totheoperation. Yetyoung people
ofboth sexes cheerfully submit tothe risk ofthis
discomfort, andtheonlyremark made bytheyouth
whom Isawundergoing itwasthat it“made hismouth
feeluncomfortable ”
(jelejeh rasamulut-nya).
The ear-boring ceremony(bertindek)appears to
have already lostmuch ofitsceremonial character in
Selangor, where Iwastoldthat itisnowusually per-
formed when thechild isquite small, i.e.attheearliest,
when thechild issome fiveorseven months old,andwhen
itisabout ayear oldatthelatest, whereas inSumatra
(according toMarsden) itisnotperformed until the
child iseight ornine .1Still, however, aspecial kind

called subang,isasmuch theemblem ofvirginity in
thewestern States as iteverwas. The“discarding”
ofthese ear-rings(tanggal subang),which should take
place about seven days after theconclusion ofthe
marriage rites, isceremonial incharacter, and itiseven
thecustom when awidow(janda)ismarried forthe
second time, toprovide herwith apair ofsubang
(which should, however, itissaid, betiedontoher
earsinstead ofbeing inserted intheear-holes, asinthe
caseofagirlwhohasnever been married).
The riteofcircumcision isofcourse common to
Muhammadans allover theworld. Some analogous
practices, however, have alsobeen noticed among the
non-Muhammadan Malayan races oftheEastern
Archipelago, and itisatleast doubtful whether cir-
cumcision asnow practised byMalays isapurely
Muhummadan rite.Among Malays itisperformed
byafunctionary called the“Mudim,”1with aslip
ofbamboo, atanyage (inthe case ofboys)
from about sixorseven uptoabout sixteen years,
thewound being often dressed (atleast intown
districts) with fine claymixed with sootand the
yolk ofeggs, butwhen possible, theclay ismixed
withcocoa-nut fibre(rabok niyor), selumur paku uban,
and theyoung shoots ofthe k'lat plantain(puchok

common purificatory rite called tepong tawar,and
withayer tolak bala (lit.evil-dispelling water). Lights
arekeptburning inthehouse forseveral days (“until
thewound hashealed ”),andtheperformance ofthe
ceremony isalways made theoccasion forabanquet,
together withmusic anddancing ofthekind inwhich
Malays take somuch delight. The cause ofthese
rejoicings isdressed fortheoccasion “like abride-

4.Personal Ceremonies andCharms
Ceremonies andcharms forprotecting orrender-
ingtheperson more attractive orformidable, form
oneofthelargest, butnotperhaps themost inter-
esting orimportant division ofthemedicine-man’s
repertory.
Thefollowing remarkable specimen ofthecharms
belonging tothe first ofthese classes wasgivenme
by’Che ‘Abas ofKlanang inSelangor, aKelantan
Malay:—
“Ifthecorpse inthegrave should speak,
Andaddress people onearth,
May Ibedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,
But ifthecorpse inthegrave donotspeak,
And address people onearth,
May Inotbedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,orbyany
foeorperil, orbyanysonofthehuman race.
And ifthechicken intheeggshould crow,
And calltochickens onearth,
May Ibedestroyed byanybeast thathas life,
But ifthechicken intheeggdonotcrow,”
(etc. etc., asbefore.)
Asageneral rule,however, this particular class of


362 PERSONAL CHARMS CHAP.
charms shows particularly strong traces ofArabic
influence, most often, perhaps, taking theform ofan
injunction (addressed toJinsorAngels) towatch over
theperson ofthepetitioner.
Torightly understand charms ofthesecond class,
which includes Bathing andBetel-charming charms,1we
musthavesome ideaoftheMalay standard ofbeauty.
This, Ineed hardly say, differs widely from that enter-
tained byEuropeans. Inthecase ofmanly beauty
weshould, perhaps, beable toacquiesce tosome
extent intheadmiration which Malays express for
“Brightness ofCountenance’'(chahia),which forms
oneofthechief objects ofpetition inalmost every
oneofthisclass ofcharms;2butnone ofourmodern
Ganymedes would belikely topetition fora“voice
likethevoice oftheProphet David ”;
3ora“coun-
tenance likethecountenance oftheProphet Joseph”
;
still lesswould hebelikely topetition foratongue
“curled likeabreaking wave,” or“amagic serpent,”
orforteeth “like aherd of(black) elephants,” or
forlips“like aprocession ofants.”4
Malay descriptions offemale beauty arenoless
curious. The “brow ”(oftheMalay Helen, forwhose
sake athousand desperate battles arefought inMalay
romances) “isliketheone-day-old moon,”5hereye-

The third class ofinvocations, forrendering the

5.BETROTHAL
Betrothal iscalled tunangan orpinangan. When
theparents ofamarriageable youth perceive asuitable
“match” fortheir son,theysend amessenger toher
parents toask ifshehasyetbeen “bespoken ”(kalau
adaorang sebut). Ifthereply issatisfactory, the
messenger isagain despatched tointimate thedesire
oftheyouth’s parents to“bespeak” thehand ofthe
favoured individual forhisson,and toarrange aday
forameeting. These preliminaries areaccompanied
bytheusual polite self-depreciation onboth sides.
Thus, thegirl’s father begins bysaying, “You wish to
bespeak thehand ofmydaughter, whoknows neither
how tocook norhow tosew ”{yang tataku masak,
tcctahu menjait). Butthecustom isnotcarried tosuch
extremes asitisinChina .2

2The youth’s representatives had
further theright tointerview the girl,
andpersonally assure themselves that
shewas“without blemish andwithout
spot.” This interview passed bythe
name ofthe“Inspection oftheBuffalo-
calf,” andwasconducted somewhat as
follows:—When theyouth’s representa-
tives (theWooing Party) gotoinspect
thegirl,oneofthem says—
‘‘Seehow fruitful arethesatela yams,
Where the hills ofBantan risebythe
sea;
Iknow notwhether good luck orcalamity
willfollow it,
Butmyheart turns towards you.”
Here oneofthegirl’s representatives
says,“Look well atthisbuffalo-calf of
mine thathasbeen allowed toforage
foritself. Maybe itscoat istorn, its
limbs broken, oritssight lost.” The
youth’s representative, ifall issatis-
factory, then replies—
“Thesunbeing sohigh,
The buffalo-calf willdieiftethered;
This long while have Ibeen prosecuting
mysearch,
Butnot tillto-day did Imeetwithwhat I
wanted.”

VI CUSTOMS ATBETROTHAL 365
The girl’s parents next callfourorfivewitnesses
(saksi)ofeither sexto“witness” thebetrothal, and
after preparing ameal (nasidan kuek) for their
expected guests, await the arrival oftheyouths
“Representatives,” theyouth himself remaining at
home. One oftheparty carries abetel-leaf tray
furnished with the usual betel-chewing appliances,
together with halfabhara ofdollars ($11) according
tothestricter custom;although (failing thedollars),
aringorbracelet, orother jewellery ofthatvalue,may
besubstituted.
Bearing these presents withthem, theyouth’s re-
presentatives proceed tothehouse ofthegirl’s parents,
where they areinvited toenter andpartake ofthe
betel-leaf provided forthem.Ameal isthen served,
Malay cakes(kueh-kueh)brought forward, and the
company again partake ofbetel.
Thetwoparties now sitdown ina“family circle,”
andoneoftheyouth’s representatives pushes forward
(di-sorongkan) thebetelwhich theyhadbrought with
them, and offers ittothepeople ofthehouse, saying,
“This isapledge ofyour daughter’s betrothal.” The
girl’s father replies, “Be itso, Iaccept it,”orwords to
that effect, andinquires howlong theengagement is
tolast,theanswer being “sixmonths”or“ayear”as
thecasemay be. Both parties then appeal tothe
witnesses to“hear what issaid,” andtheyouth’s rela-
tives return totheirhomes.
Themarriage portion being fixed (inSelangor) by
analmost universal custom attwobharas ofdollars
($44), theamount isnotusually mentioned atthebe-
trothal, itbeing understood that theusual amount is
intended. But ifthegirl’s parents should afterwards
prove reluctant toproceed with thematch, they


366 BETROTHAL CHAP.
forfeit twice theamount ofthe pledge -money
which theyhave received;whereas iftheyouth re-
fuses toproceed hemerely forfeits thepledge-money
($ii)already paid tothegirl’s parents. Some families
payamarriage portion of$30only,andothers (such
asthefamily of’TohKaya Kechil ofKlang) pay
asmuch as$50, butexceptions are rare, $44being
now generally recognised asthecustomary wedding
portion.
However, the girl’s family does notreally receive
anything likethe fullvalue ofthe$44,because ifthe
$44ispaid infulltheproposer hasaright tode-
mand acomplete outfit(persalinan)ofsilk attire, to
thevalue ofabout $20, sothat theamount which
actually changes hands isseldom more than about
$24.
TheMalay fiancde, unlike herEuropean sister, is
attheutmost pains tokeep outofherlover’s way,and
toattain thisobject she issaid tobe“aswatchful asa
tiger.” Noengagement-ring isused inthisneigh-
bourhood, nopriest (orLebai) ispresent atthe
engagement ceremony, nor isthe girlasked forher
consent. Ontheother hand, aregular system ofex-
changing presents, after theengagement, issaid to

time totime innet-work receptacles, andthewoman

ofBritish Malaya, under theword
“Marriage,” wefind:—
‘‘The only terms formarriage in

Both thesewords areused inSelangor,
thefirst(nikah), which properly signifies
themere ceremony or“wedding,”
being more commonly used bythe
better class ofMalays than themore
comprehensive kahwin,which corre-
sponds pretty nearly totheEnglish

without allowing aninterval, “Iaccept thismarriage

completed, oneofthebrothers ornear relations ofthe
bridegroom leads him into thebridal chamber, and
seatshim intheusual cross-legged position onthe

onhisright. Even theprocess ofseating thecouple

hastobend theknees slowly until asitting posture is
reached, andthen return toastanding posture by
slowly straightening theknees, agymnastic exercise
which hastoberepeated thrice, andwhich requires the

handfuls ofricetaken from thenasi setakona;
with
thisthetwofeedeach other simultaneously, each of
them reaching outthehand containing thericetothe

The bridegroom isthen carried offbyhisfriends

which heiscarried back tohisoldpost, thebride in

This completes thewedding ceremony, butthe
bridegroom isnominally expected toremain under the
roof(and eye)ofhismother-in-law forabout twoyears
(reduced toforty-four days inthecase of“royalty”),
afterwhich hemaybeallowed toremove toahouse

VI STEALING THEBRIDEGROOM 335
Forthree days lustrations arecontinued bythe
newly-married pair,butbefore they arecompleted, and
assoon aspossible after thewedding, friends and
acquaintances oncemore putontheir finery, and
proceed tothehouse topay their respects, tobathe,
andtoreceive largess.
Onthethird dayafter theharilangsong there isa
very curious ceremony calledmandi tolak bala,ormandi
ayersalamat (bathing forgood luck).
Onthenight inquestion therelatives ofthebride-
groom assemble under cover ofthedarkness andmake
abonfire under thehouse ofthenewly-married couple
bycollecting andburning rubbish;intothe firethus
kindled they throw cocoa-nut husks andpepper, or
anything likely tomake itunpleasant forthose within,
andpresently raise such asmoke that thebridegroom
comes hastily down thesteps, ostensibly toseewhat
isthematter, butassoon ashemakes hisappearance,
heisseized byhisrelatives andcarried offbodily to
hisownparents’ house;these proceedings beingknown
asthestealing ofthebridegroom(churi pengantiri).
Next daythere isagrand procession toescort him
back tothehouse ofhisbride, which hereaches about
oneo’clock intheafternoon, theprocessionists carrying
“Rice ofthePresence ”
(nasiadap-adap') withtheeggs
stuck into itasonthe lastdayofthewedding, two
sorts ofholywater inpitchers, called respectively ayer
salamat (water ofgood luck), andayer tolak bala(water
toavert ill-luck), vases offlowers (gumba) containing
blossom-spikes ofthecocoa-nut andareca-nut palms, and
young cocoa-nut leaves rudely plaited intothesemblance
ofspikes ofpalm-blossom, k’risses, etc.etc.,together with
alargenumber ofrudesyringes manufactured from joints
ofbamboo, andcalledpanah ayer,or“water-bows.”

Asetofsimilar objects (including nasiadap-adap\
isprepared bytherelatives ofthebride, anddeposited
upon theground intheplace selected forthebathing
ceremony. Abench being added forthebride and
bridegroom tositupon, theceremony commences with
thecustomary riteoftepong tawar, afterwhich thetwo
kinds ofholy water, ayer tolak balaandayersalamat,
aresuccessively thrown over thepair.
Now, according totheproper custom, during the
proceedings which follow, allthe bride’s relatives
should surround thebride’s seat,andthebridegroom’s
relatives should stand atadistance;but, inorder to
save themselves from awetting, thewomen ofboth
parties now usually assemble round thebride and
bridegroom, where they areprotected byasheet which
ishung between them andthemen;foralltheyoung
mennowproceed todischarge their “water arrows,”
andasthey arestopped bythesheet theyproceed to
turn their syringes against each other, until allare
thoroughly wetted.
Meanwhile ayoung cocoa-nut frond, twisted into
aslip-knot withV-shaped ends (something likethe
“merry thought” ofafowl), ispresented tothebride
andbridegroom, each ofwhom takes hold ofoneend,
andblowing on it(sembor)
thrice, pulls ittill itcomes
undone, andthelepas-lepas rite isconcluded. Finally,
agirdle ofthread ispassed seven times over theheads
andunder thefeetofthebride andbridegroom, when
thebridegroom breaks through thethread andthey
are allfreetoreturn homewards. This latterceremony
iscalled 'lat- lat.The guests then return totheir
homes, divest themselves oftheir wetgarments, and
putontheirwedding attire. The bersnap-snap an,or
feeding ceremony, isthen performed (both vessels

ofadap-adap ricebeing used), andthen allparties
disperse fortheusual games. Seven days after the
“Concluding Day ”(.Hari Langsong),theceremony
ofDiscarding theEarrings (i.e.subang,theemblems
ofvirginity) isperformed bythebride.
RajaBotofSelangor, whoattaches great importance
tothelustration ceremony, andsays that itought not
totake place later than theseventh day (ataRaja’s
wedding), thus describes the fullceremony asonce
arranged byhimself:—Asmall bath-house was built
atthetopofaflight ofseven steps, andwater was
pumped uptoitthrough apipe,whose upper endwas
made fastunder theroof oftheshed, andterminated
inthehead ofadragon(naga),fromwhose jaws
thewater spouted. The steps were completely lined
withwomen, ofwhom there must have been an
immense number (nomenbeing allowed tobepresent),
andtheRaja and hisbride bathed before them.A
royal bath-house ofthiskind iscalled baleipancha
t>ersada,and should beused notonly at“royal”
weddings, butatcoronations(waktu di-naubatkaii);
itisdescribed inthefollowing lines:—
“Naik baleipancha persada
Di-hadap ulehsagala Biduanda,
Dudok semaiam dengan bertakhta.
Mandi ayeryang kalaar dimulutNaga”—
which maybetranslated:—
“Ascend totheRoyal Bath-House
Inthepresence ofallyour courtiers,
Take your seat inroyal state,
Andbathe inthewater that flows from theDragon’s
Mouth.”
Itmust notbesupposed that, with such amass of
detail, many things may nothave been overlooked,


388 MARRIAGE CHAP.
but itmayberemarked assome sortofapractical
conclusion tothisaccount, thattheMalay wedding cere-
mony, even ascarried outbythepoorer classes, shows
that thecontracting parties aretreated asroyalty,
that istosay,assacred human beings, and ifany
further proof isrequired, inaddition totheevidence
whichmaybedrawn from thegeneral character ofthe
ceremony, Imay mention, firstly, the fact that the
bride andbridegroom areactually called Raja Sari,
(i.e.Raja sa-hari,the“sovereigns ofaday ”)
;and,
secondly, that itisapolite fiction thatnocommand
oftheirs, during theironedayofsovereignty, maybe
disobeyed.
Iwillnowgive accounts oftwoMalay weddings
which took place atKlang :both accounts werecom-
posed byrespectable Malays, the firstonebeing trans-
lated byMr.Douglas Campbell ofSelangor, andthe
second bythepresent writer:—

been onlysuch asarebased onapeaceful understand-
ingbetween theparents ofthecontracting parties. An
account ofMalay marriage customs would not,how-
ever, becomplete without some mention ofthecustoms
which regulate, strange as itmay seem, even the
forcible abduction ofawife. Ofthese customs Sir
W.E.Maxwell says:—
“The word panjat inMalay means literally ‘to
climb,’ but itisused inPerak, andperhaps inother
Malay States, tosignify aforcible entry into ahouse
forthepurpose ofsecuring asawifeawoman whom
her relations have already refused tothe intruder.
Thishigh-handed proceeding isrecognised byMalay
custom, and isregulated bycertain well-known rules.
“Panjat isoftwokinds—panjat angkara andpanjat
’adat—entrybyviolence andentrybycustom. Inthe
firstcase, themanmakes hisway intothehouse armed
with his kris, orother weapon, and entering the
women’s apartment, orposting himself atthedoor,
secures theperson ofhisintended bride, orprevents
herescape. Heruns theriskofbeing killed onthe

upon hisreputation forcourage andstrength, andupon
thenumber ofhisfriends and theinfluence ofhis
family. Awooer who adopts thisviolent method of
compelling theassent ofunwilling relations tohis
marriage tooneoftheir kinmust, saytheMalays,
have three qualifications—
“Ka-rapat-an baniak,
Wang-nia ber-lebih
,
Jantan-nia ber-lebih,
‘Astrong party toback him, plenty ofmoney, andno
lackofbravery.’
“Plenty ofmoney isnecessary, because, byaccepted
custom, iftherelations yield andgive their consent
allthecustomary payments aredoubled;thefine for
thetrespass, which would ordinarily betwenty-five
dollars, becomes fifty dollars;thedower islikewise
doubled, andtheusual present ofclothes (salin) must
consist oftwoofeach ofthethreegarments(salendang,
baju,kain), instead ofone asusual. The fine for
panjat angkara maybeofanyamount, according to
thepleasure ofthewoman’s relations, andthey fix it
high orlowaccording totheman’s position. Ihave
heard ofonecase inPerak, where thefinewas five
hundred dollars, andanother inwhich thesuitor, to
obtain hisbride, hadtopayonethousand seven hun-
dredand fifty dollars, namely, onethousand twohun-
dredand fifty dollars asafine,andfivehundred dollars
forthemarriage expenses. But inthiscase the girl
wasalready betrothed toanother, andonethousand

with their legsstretched put(belunjor kaki), thebody
being then laidacross their laps {riba). Several men
arethen told offtofetch water injars,scoop itoutof

means ofthe“scoop” {penchedok ayer), which isusu-

Itfrequently happens, however, that thisunpleasant
task finds novolunteers, inwhich case fivebanana

onwhich thebody israised from thefloorduring the
process ofwashing {meruang). When thebody is
ready forwashing, achief washer {orang meruang) is
engaged forafeeofabout adollar;this isusually the
Bilal orImam, who“shampoos” thebody whilst the

about twogallons, thewater atthetopbeing poured
offintoavessel ofsimilar capacity, andscooped up
and sprinkled asbefore onthecorpse. The next
washing iswith juice oflimes. Four orfivelimes
{liman nipis) aretaken, theends cut off,andeach lime
slashed crosswise onthetopwithout completely sever-
ingtheparts. These limes arethensqueezed {di-ramas-

washing repeated. The finalwashing, or“NineWaters”

VI WASHING THEBODY 401
(ayer sambilan,socalled from thewater being scooped
up,andpoured thrice tothe right, thrice tothe left,
andthrice over thefront ofthecorpse from head to
foot) isperformed with fresh water asatfirst,and
thewhole ceremony when completed iscalled bedara.
Thewashing completed, theorifices—
eg.ears, nostrils,
eyes—aregenerally stopped with cotton, andthebody
iscarried back toitsmattress, and laid inashroud of
white cotton cloth, which should beabout seven feet
longbyfour feet inwidth(salabuh),sothattheedges
meet over thebreast. After thisthelastkiss isgiven
bythenearest relatives, whomust not,however,disturb
thecorpse byletting their tears fallupon itsfeatures.
Theshroud isusually ofthree thicknesses inthecase
ofpoor people, butwealthier families use five,and
even seven -fold shrouds. InSelangor, however,
eachshroud isusually aseparate piece ofcloth. The
deadbody ofachild issometimes covered inaddition
with afinesortofwhite powder (aboktanah ortaya-
mam)> which issprinkled over the faceand arms.
Five knots areused infastening theshroud, theends
being drawn upand tied [hochong) bymeans ofthe
unravelled hemorselvage oftheshroud torn intotape-
likestrips /which arebound thrice round thebody at
thebreast, theknees, and thehips respectively, as

about twenty leaves ofthesweet-scented pandanus

“Centipedes’ Feet” (jari lipan)> about three feet
longbytwo fingers inbreadth, and laid atshort

five tosixofthese floral strips, theareca blossom
alternating with thepandanus. Thenumber of

sending him tothegrave, partly because ofthe
pahala ormerit thereby obtained, and partly (no

special dress orsignofmourning, such asthewhite
sashwithcoloured ribbon which issometimes worn at
Singapore (unless thekabong puteh orstrip ofwhite

TheImam then reads prayers, and thecompany

passages from theKoran areplentifully quoted against
excess ineating ordrinking. Air,they say, isthe

“The mysterious sympathy between man and
external nature .... wasthebasis ofthatsystem
ofsupernatural magic which prevailed inEurope during
theMiddle Ages.”1
Theforegoing quotation shows thatthedistinctive
features oftheAristotelian hygienic theory, asborrowed
bytheArabs, dideventually filter through (insome
cases) until they reached theMalays. Such direct
references, however, toGreek theories areoftherarest
character, andcanhardly beconsidered typical.
Most ofthemore important rites practised bythe
Malay medicine-men(Bomor2
)maybedivided into
two well-defined parts. Commencing with acere-
monial “inspection ”(thecounterpart ofourmodern
“diagnosis”), theBomor proceeds tocarry outa
therapeutic ceremony, thenature ofwhich isdecided
bytheresults ofthe“inspection.” Forthepurposes
ofthediagnosis heresorts todivination, bymeans of

TheWave- Offering
Onone occasion, during myresidence inthe
Kuala Langat district ofSelangor, Ihadthegood
fortune tobepresent atthe“waving” ofasacrificial tray
(anchak) containing offerings tothe spirits. The ac-
count ofthisceremony, which Ishallnow give, ismade
upfrom notes taken during theactual performance. To
commence:—ThePawang satdown with hisback to
thepatient, facing amultitude ofdishes which con-
tained thevarious portions ofcooked anduncooked
food. The tray itselfwassuspended ataheight of
about three feetfrom theground inthecentre ofthe
room, just infront ofthePawangs head. Lighting a
waxtaper andremoving theyam-leaf covering from
themouth ofthejarcontaining “holy” water, the
Pawang now“inspected”thewater inthejarby
gazing intently into itsdepths, andre-extinguished the
taper. Then hefumigated hishands inthesmoke of
thecenser, extended them forabrief interval over the
“holy”water, took thecenser inboth hands, described
three circles round thejarwith it,set itdown again,


VI WAVINGTHEANCHAK419
and stirred thewater thrice with asmall knife or
dagger(k'rts), theblade ofwhich hekept inthewater
while hemuttered acharm tohimself. Then he
charmed thebetel-stand andthe firstdish ofcooked
food, pushing the latter aside and covering it
with asmall dish-cover ashefinished thecharm.
Next, atthehands ofoneofthecompany, heaccepted,
intwo pieces, fivecubits ofyellow cloth (yellow being
theroyal colour), andasmall vessel of“oilofCelebes,”
with which, itmaybeadded, heanointed thepalms of
bothhands before hetouched thecloth itself. Next,
hefumigated thelatter inthesmoke ofthecenser, one
endofthecloth being grasped firmly intheright hand,
andtheremainder ofitbeing passed round theright
wrist, andoverandunder theright arm, while the
looseendtrailed across hislap. Next, after repeating
theusual charm, hebreathed ononeendofthecloth,
passed thewhole ofthecloth through hisfingers,
fumigated it,and laid itaside;tookaneggwhich was
presented tohimupon atray,anddeposited itexactly
inthecentre ofalarge dish ofparched rice. Next,
hepushed aside thejarofholy water, lowered thetray
bymeans ofthecordattached toit(which passed over
abeam), andproceeded tosupervise thepreparation of
the tray,which wasbeing decorated with the“centi-
pede” fringe byone ofthecompany acting asan
assistant. The fringe having been fitted bythelatter
totheedges ofthetray,andthelatter lined with three
thicknesses ofbanana leaf, thePawang described a
circle round itthrice with thecenser, andthen de-
posited thecenser upon the floor, exactly under the
centre ofthetray. Then anointing hishands again he
passed them overboth trayand fringe. Abriefpause
followed, andthen thePawang took thelarger piece of


420 MEDICINE CHAP.
yellow cloth andwrapped itlikearoyal robearound
theshoulders ofthepatient ashesatupinside his
mosquito curtain. Another brief pause, and the
Pawang betook himself oncemore tothefilling ofthe
tray. Taking alarge bowl ofparched rice,hescooped
uptherice inhishands, and let itrunthrough his
fingers intothetray, until there wasalayer ofparched
rice inthelatter ofatleastaninch indepth, andthen
deposited theegg, already alluded to,inthevery
centre oftheparched rice. Next hetook acomb of
bananas (presented byoneofthecompany), andcut-
tingthem offonebyonedeposited them inadish,
fromwhich theywere presently transferred tothetray.
ThePawang nowreturned tothepatient, andkneeling
down infront ofhim,fumigated hishands inthesmoke
ofthecenser, and then, muttering acharm, wrapped
thesmaller piece ofyellow cloth turban-wise round his
ownhead, andslowly andcarefully pushed theyellow-
robed patient (whowas still inasitting posture) for-
ward untilhereached aspotwhich wasexactly under
thecentre ofthetray,andwhich faced, Iwas told, the
“place oftheRising Sun.”
The long straw-coloured streamers ofthetray-
fringe dropped gracefully around thepatient onevery
side,andhad itnotbeen foroccasional bright glimpses
oftheyellow cloth hewould have been almost in-
visible.
The censer, voluming upwards itsash-gray smoke,
wasnowpassed fromhand tohand three times round
thepatient, and finally deposited onthe floor athis
feet.
Theloading ofthetraynowrecommenced, andthe
Pawang standing upandlooking towards thesouth,
deposited in itcarefully the several portions of


VI CONTENTS OFTHEANCHAK 42
“cooked” offerings (thesum ofthevarious portions
making upawhole fowl). Then, afterwashing his
hands, headded tothetraysmall portions ofricevari-
ously prepared andcoloured (viz.parched andwashed
rice,and ricestained yellow (saffron), green, red, blue,
andblack, seven kinds inall). Next hedeposited in
the tray theuncooked portions, whose sum also
amounted toawhole fowl, then, after afurther hand-
washing, the“cakes,” and finally, after alastwashing,
hefastened tothe“suspenders”1ofthetraythesmall
ornamental rice-bags called ketupat andlepat .2
Butthe listofcreature comforts provided forthe
spirits comprised other things besides food. Five
miniature water -buckets, each manufactured from a
strip ofbanana leafskewered together ateachend
with abamboo pin,werenow filled, thealternate
corner oneswithwater andcane-juice (called “palm-
toddy” intheSpirit Language), andthecentral onewith
theblood ofthefowls killed forthe sacrifice. They
were then dulydeposited inthetraybythePawang.
Fivewaxen tapers, to“light thespirits totheir food,”
were next“charmed” andlighted, andplanted inthe
centre andfourcorners respectively.
Finally, nodoubt forthespirits’ after-dinner enjoy-
ment, five“chews” ofbetel-leaf and fivenative-made
cigarettes (tobacco rolled instrips ofpalm-leaf), were
charmed and actually lighted atalamp, anddeposited
inthetraywith theother offerings, and atthesame

time five50cent (silver) pieces ofStraits money, called
“tray-stones,” were added tothemedley, evidently
with theobject ofpreventing thegood temper of
the spirits from being disturbed by“shortness of
cash.”
The loading ofthetraybeing nowcomplete, the
Pawang walked thrice round thepatient (whowas still
overshadowed bythe tray), andpassed thecenser
round him thrice. Standing thenwith hisface tothe
east, soastolook inthesame direction asthepatient,
hegrasped the“suspenders”ofthetray with both
hands attheirconverging point, andthrice muttered a
charm, giving adownward tugtothecord ofthetray
attheendofeach repetition. This done, heremoved
theyellow cloth from hishead, andfastened itround
thetray-cord atthepointwhere the“suspenders”con-
verged, andthen“waved" theoffering bycausing the
loaded tray with itsflaring tapers toswing slowly
backwards andforwards justover thepatient’s head.
Next, letting thetray slowly down anddetaching it
from the cord, attheconverging point, heagain
“waved" itslowly toand froamid theflaring ofthe
tapers, seven times insuccession, andheld itoutfor
thepatient tospit into. When thiswasdone he
sallied outintothedarkness ofthenight carrying the
tray,andgaining thejungle, suspended itfrom atree
(ofthekind called petai belalang) which hadbeen
selected thatverydayforthepurpose. Awhite ant,
immediately settling upon theoffering, was hailed by
theMalays present with great delight asasign that
thespirits hadaccepted theoffering, whereupon weall
returned tothehouse andthecompany broke up.The
ceremony hadcommenced about 8p.m.,and lasted
about anhourand ahalf,andthenumber ofpeople


VI THELIMAS 423
present was fourteen, seven male andseven female,
which wasthenumber stipulated bythePawang.
Another form of“propitiation”(buang-buangan
limas) ceremony consists inloading alimas with
theofferings. The limas isareceptacle ofabout
aspan(sa-jengkal)inlength, made ofbanana -leaf
folded together attheendsandskewered withabam-
boo pin. Inside itaredeposited theofferings, which
consist ofthe following articles :achupak (half
cocoa-nutful) of“parched”rice, asetofthree, five,
orseven bananas, a“pinch”(sa-jemput)of“saffron”
rice, apinch of“washed”rice, anative cigarette
(rokok)}anegg, awax taper, two“chews” ofbetel-
leaf,andabetel-leaf twisted upintotheshape ofa
spiral {pantat siput). One (atleast) ofthetwo
“chews” ofbetelmust bespecially prepared, as itis
tobeleftbehind forthe spirits tochew, whilst the
other istaken back into thepresence ofthesick
man, where themedicine -manchews itand ejects
thechewed leaf(di-sembor)upon the“small”ofthe
sickmans back. Inthecase ofthe“chew” which
isleftbehind forthe spirits, theordinary portion of
betel -nutmust bereplaced bynutmeg, thegambier
bymace, andthelimeby“oil ofCelebes”(minyak
Bugis).
When theceremony ofloading thelimas is
complete, itiscarried down tothenearest river
orsea,and there set adrift with the following
words:—
“Peace bewith you, Khailir (Khizr), Prophet ofGodandLord
ofwater,
Maduraya isthename ofyour sire,
Madaruti thename ofyourmother,
SiKekas thename oftheir child;
Accept thispresent fromyouryounger brother, SiKekas,


424 MEDICINE CHAP.
Cause himnosickness orheadache.
Here ishis,youryounger brother’s, present.”
Here theLimas issetadrift, andthewater underneath
itscooped upandcarried home, where itisused for
bathing thesickman.
Another very simple form of“propitiation”is
called ambang -ambangan, and isperformed as
follows:—
Take seven “chews” ofbetel-leaf, seven native
cigarettes(rokok),seven bananas, anegg, andan
overflowing chupak (half cocoa-nutful) ofparched
rice (bertih sa-chupak abong),1rollthem allup
together inabanana leaf(which must beacubit in
length andofthesame variety ofbanana asthe first),
anddeposit them inaplacewhere three roads meet
(ifanything “a littlewayalong theleft-hand road of
thethree,”) andrepeat thischarm:—
“Jembalang Jembali, Demon oftheEarth,
Accept thisportion asyourpayment
And restore So-and-So.
But ifyoudonotrestore him
Ishall curse youwith thesaying,
‘There isnogodbutGod,’”etc.
Theabove ceremony isgenerally used inthecase
offever complaint.
Counter -charms for“neutralising” the active
principle ofpoisons form, asarule,oneofthemost
important branches ofthepharmacopceic system
among the less civilised Malay tribes. Asettled
form ofgovernment andthesoftening ofmanners
due tocontact withEuropean civilisation has,how-
ever, diminished theimportance (Ispeak, ofcourse,

VI NEUTRALISING POISONS 425
from theMalay point ofview) ofthisbranch ofthe
subject intheWestern Malay States ofthePenin-
sula,where poisoning cases arevery rarely heard of.
Malay women have always possessed thereputation
ofbeing especially proficient intheuseofpoison;
ground glass and thefurry spicules obtained from
theleaf-cases ofsome kinds ofbamboo being their
favourite weapons.
This idea (ofusing acharm to“neutralise” the
active principle ofpoison) hasbeen extended by
Malay medicine -men tocover allcases where any
evil principle (even, forinstance, afamiliar spirit) is
believed tohave entered thesick person’s system.
Allsuch charms arepiously regarded bydevout
Muhammadans asgifts due tothemercy ofGod,
who isbelieved tohave sentthem down tothe
Prophet Muhammad bythehand ofhisservant Gab-
riel. This doctrine wefind clearly stated inthe
charms themselves, eg.(somewhat tautologically):—
“Neutralising charms sprang fromGod,
Neutralising charms were created byGod,
Neutralising charms were aboon fromGod,
Whocommanded Prince Gabriel
Tobringthem untoMuhammad.”
Theceremony ofapplying suchcharms generally
takes theform ofgrating abezoar -stone1
(batu
guliga),mixing theresult with water, anddrinking
itafter repeating thecharm.
Thus inoneofthecharms quoted intheAppendix
weread:—
“TheUpas loses itsvenom,
AndPoison loses itsvenom,
And theSea-Snake loses itsvenom,

intheblow-gun poison usedbythewild tribes), Iwas
told that ifamanwhowas“struck” by itwassup-

tooareanimate objects from theMalay point ofview.]
Von deWall describes itas“the enchanting or

from atigerwhich onesees,3from apoison-tree which

medicine. Imaytake thisopportunity ofpointing out
that Ihave used theword “mischief” totranslate it
when dealing with thecharms, asthis isthenearest
English equivalent which Ihave been able tofind
;
indeed, itappears avery fairly exact equivalent when
weremember itsuse inEnglish insuch phrases as
“It’sgotthemischief init,”which issometimes used
even ofinanimate objects.
There areahundred andninety ofthese mischiefs,
according tosome, according toothers, ahundred
andninety-three. Their origin isvery variously given.
One authority says that the first badi sprang from
three drops ofAdam’s blood (which were spilton
theground). Another (rather inconsistently) declares
that the“mischief”(badi)residing inaniguana
(ibiawak)wastheorigin ofallsubsequent “mischiefs,”
yetadds later thatthe“Heart ofTimber” was their
origin, andyetagain that theyellow glow atsunset
(called Mambang Kuning orthe“Yellow Deity”)
was their origin. These two latter are,perhaps the
most usual theories, butathird medicine-man declares
thatthefirstbadiwastheoffspring oftheJin(“genie”)
IbnUjan (Ibnu Jan?), who resides intheclouds (or
caverns?)andhollows ofthe hills. Thus doMalay
medicine-men disagree.
These “mischiefs”reside notonly inanimate, but
also ininanimate objects. Thus inoneofthe ele-
phant-charms given intheAppendix several different
“mischiefs”aredescribed asresiding inearth, ant-
hills,wood, water, stone, andelephants (orrhinoceroses)
respectively. Again, inadeer-charm, various “mis-
chiefs”arerequested toreturn totheir place oforigin,
i.e. totheIguana (strictly speaking, theMonitor
Lizard), Heart ofTimber, and theYellow Glow of

Sunset. Yetanother deer-charm callsupon “Badi”
(astheoffspring oftheJin IbnUjan,who resides in
theclouds andhollows ofthe hills), toreturn thereto .1
Iwillnowproceed todescribe theceremony of
“casting out” these “mischiefs.”
The chief occasions onwhich thiscasting outtakes
place are, first,when somebody isill,andhissickness
isattributed tohisaccidental contact with (and conse-
quent “possession by”)oneofthese mischiefs;and,
secondly, when any wild animal orbird iskilled.
Theceremony ofcasting outthemischief from the
carcases ofbiggame willbefound described under
theheading of“Hunting Ceremonies.” Ishall here
confine myself toabrief description oftheceremony
asconducted forthebenefit ofsickpersons.
Firstmake upabunch ofleaves(sa-cherek),con-
sisting oftheshrubs called pulut-pulut andselaguri,
with branches ofthegandarusa and lenjziang merah
(red dracaena), allofwhich arewrapped together ina
leafofthesi-pulih,and tiedround with apiece of
tree-bark(kulit frap\ ortheakar gastng-gasing.
With thisleaf-brush youaretocastoutthemischief.
Then yougrate ontoasaucer small pieces ofebony
wood, brazil wood, “laka ”wood, sandalwood, and
eagle-wood (lignaloes), mixthem with water, putting
inafew small pieces ofscrap-iron, and rubthe
patient allover with themixture.
1VideApp. lx., lxxii., lxxix. The
different names under which “Badi”
isinvoked areworth noting;e.g.

Asyoudothis, repeat theappropriate charm;
then take thebrush ofleaves andstroke thepatient
alloverdownwards fromhead tofoot,saying :—

Whilst reciting theabove, stand upright, close tothe

This spear must afterwards beransomed, (say) for

The directions foranother form oftheceremony

VI CEREMONIES ANDCHARMS 43
youmust rubhim(orher) allover with limes inorder
to“castoutthemischief.” These limes must beof
seven different kinds, andyou willrequire three of
each kind. When youhave gotthem, fumigate them
with incense andrepeat theappropriate charm, which
ispractically anappeal addressed tothe spirit ofthe
limes toassist inextracting thepoisonous principle
from thebody ofthesickman:—
“Peace bewith you,OLelang,
Wehavebeen brothers from theformer time untilnow,
Iamfain toorder youtoassistmeinextracting everything that
ispoisonous
From thebodyandlimbs ofSo-and-So.
Break notyoursolemn promise,
Break notyour plighted faith,

Ofcourse theluckless spirit istoldthat ifhedoes
notdoexactly asheisbidden hemust expect thecurse

Thischarm must berepeated overnight, andearly
nextmorning three thicknesses ofbirah leaves must

distance from thehouse. The only special taboo
mentioned forthisceremony isthatthepatient must
notduring itscontinuance meetanybody whohascome
from adistance.
Another very curious form ofthisceremony of
“casting outdevils”wasdescribed tomebyaKelan-
tanMalay. Itisworked onthesubstitute or“scape-
goat” principle (tukar ganti), andtheidea istomake
littledough images ofallkinds ofbirds, beasts, fishes,
andeven inanimate objects (afewoftheformer being
fowls, ducks, horses, apes, buffaloes, bullocks, wild
cattle(seladang),deer, mouse-deer, and elephants,
besides those enumerated inthecharm itself, whilst
exceptions aretobethe“unlucky” animals(benatang
sial)such ascats, tigers, pigs,dogs, snakes, andiguanas).
When made they aretobedeposited together ina
heapupon asacrificial tray(anchak),together with
betel-leaves, cigarettes, andtapers. One ofthetapers
ismade tostand upon asilver dollar, with theendof
apiece ofparticoloured thread inserted between the
dollar andthefootofthetaper;andtheother endof
thisthread isgiven tothepatient tohold whilst the
necessary charm isbeing repeated.
Partofthischarm isworth quoting, as ithelps to
explain the line ofthought onwhich themedicine-
man isworking:—
“Ihavemade asubstitute foryou,
Andengage you forhire.
Asforyourwish toeat, Igiveyoufood,
Asforyour wish todrink, Igiveyoudrink.
Lo, Igiveyougoodmeasure whether ofsharks,
Skates, lobsters, crabs, shell-fish (both oflandandsea)—
Every kind ofsubstitute Igiveyou,
Good measure whether offlesh orofblood, bothcooked andraw.
Accept, accept duly thisbanquet ofmine.


VI THESPIRIT BOAT 433
Itwasgood atthe first :ifitisnotgood now,
Itisnot Iwhogive it.”
The explanation ofthis part oftheceremony is
thattheevil spirit, or“mischief,” issupposed toleave
thebody ofthesickman,and toproceed (guided, of
course, bythemany-coloured thread which thepatient
holds inhishand) toenter intothechoice collection of
“scapegoats”lying inthetray. Assoon ashisdevil-
ship isgot fairly intothetray, themedicine-man looses
three slip-knots(lepas-lepas\ andrepeats acharm to
induce theevil spirit togo,andthrows away theuntied
knots outside thehouse.
The original “disease-boat”used inSelangor was
amodel ofaspecial kind ofMalay vessel called lan-
chang. This lanchang wasatwo-masted vessel with
galleries(dandan)foreand aft,armed with cannon,
andused byMalay Rajas ontheSumatran coast.
This latter factwas,nodoubt, onereason foritsbeing
selected asthetypeofboatmost likely toprove accept-
able tothespirits. Tomake itstillfurther acceptable,
however, themodel wasnotunfrequently stained with
turmeric orsaffron, yellow being recognised asthe
royal colour among theMalays.
Occasionally, ontheother hand, amere raft(rakit)
isset adrift, sometimes asmall model ofthebalei
(state-chamber), andsometimes only asetofthe
banana-leaf receptacles called limas.
The vessel inthecase ofanimportant person is
occasionally ofgreat sizeandexcellent finish—indeed,
local tradition has itthatanexceptionally large and
perfect specimen (which waslaunched upon theKlang
river inSelangor some years ago,ontheoccasion of
anillness oftheTungku ’Chik, eldest daughter ofthe
late Sultan), wasactually towed down toseabythe


434 MEDICINE CHAP.
Government steam launch ‘Abdul Samad. When all
isready thelanchang isloaded with offerings, which
areofanexactly similar character tothose which are
deposited onthe sacrificial tray oranchak1already
described. Then oneendofapiece ofyellow thread
isfastened tothepatient’s wrist (theother endbeing
presumably made fasttothespirit-boat, orlanchang);
incense isburnt andacharm recited, thepurport of
itbeing topersuade the evil spirits which have taken
possession ofthepatient toenter onboard thevessel.
This, when they arethought tohave done so, is
then2taken down totheseaorriver and setadrift,
invariably attheebb tide,which issupposed tocarry
theboat(and thespirits with it)“toanother country.”
Oneofthecharms used atthisstage oftheceremony
even mentions thename ofthecountry towhich the
devils aretobecarried, theplace singled out for
this distinction being theIsland ofCelebes !The
passage inquestion runs asfollows:—
“Peace beunto you, Devils ofthesea,andDemons ofthesea,
Neither oncape, norbay,norsandbank beyestuck orstranded !
This vessel(lanchang)isthatofArong,3
1Vide pp.418seqq.,supra.
Strictly speaking, money (which
iscalled batu-batu lanchang oxlanchang
stones) should always form partofthem.
InKedah three kenderi (one kenderi
amounting tothree cents) aresaid to
beused;inPerak threewang
}and in
Selangor three duits (cents).
2Ibelieve this usually takes place
immediately after theceremony, but
onemedicine-man whom Iknew (’Che
Amal ofJugra) used tokeep theboat
intowhich the spirits were thought to
haveentered until thepatient recovered,
andthen set itadrift. When the
medicine-man islaunching it,hetakes
theboat inboth hands, andrepeatedly
gives itarotatory movement towards
the left (as ifhewere using asieve),and repeats thecharm. Asmall
portion ofeach dish deposited inthe
lanchang hastobecarried back tothe
patient’s house, andthere administered
tothe patient, together with water
scooped upinabowl from underneath
thelanchang asitlayinthewater be-
fore drifting away. Asthesickman
receives theofferings, theperson who
administers them says, addressing the
spirit ofevil,“Here isyour wage,
return notback hereuntoSo-and-So;
andcause himtobesicknomore,” and
the spirit replies through theman’s
mouth, “Iwillnever return.”

To itsown place.

Thissamecharm isused mutatis mutandis forthe
Balei (Spirit-hall).
Acommon form ofthe“Lanchang” charm runs
asfollows:—
“Ho,elders oftheupper reaches,
Elders ofthelower reaches,
Elders ofthedryland,
Elders oftheriver-flats,
Assemble ye,Opeople, Lords ofhilland hill-foot,
Lords ofcavern andhill-locked basin,

Sometimes thecrocodile-spirit isrequested toact
astheforwarding agent inthetransaction;thuswe
findashort lanchang -charm running asfollows:—
“Ho,Elder oftheSloping Bank, Jambu Agai,1
Receive this(lanchang) andforward ittotheRiver-Bay,

Asomewhat longer charm, which isgiven inthe
Appendix, commences bymaking aninteresting
point—
“Peace bewithyou !Ocrewnewly come from yourshipwrecked
barque onthehigh seas,
Spurned bythebillows, blown about bythegale;
Come onboard (this lanchang) inturnandgetyoufood.”
Thespeaker goesontosaythatherecognises their
right tolevy toll allover thecountry, andhasmade
thislanchang forthem asasubstitute(tukar ganti),
implying, nodoubt, inplace oftheonewhich they
had lost. Inany case, however, there canbelittle
doubt thatthe“barque wrecked onthehigh seas”is
thewasted body ofthesickman, ofwhich thespirits
were sorecently inpossession, and insubstitution for
which they areoffered thespirit-boat inquestion.
Tiger Spirit
Ishallnowproceed todescribe theceremony of
invoking theTiger Spirit forthepurpose ofobtaining
hisassistance inexpelling arival spirit oflesspower.
Intheautumn of1896 (intheKuala Langat District
ofSelangor) thebrother ofmyMalay collector ‘Umar
happening tofall illofsome slight ailment, Iasked
andobtained permission tobepresent attheceremony
ofdoctoring the patient. The time fixed forthe
commencement oftheceremony (which isusually
repeated forthree consecutive nights) was seven
o’clock onthefollowing evening. Onreaching the

house atthetime appointed Iwasmetby‘Umar,
andascending thehouse -ladder, was invited toseat
myself upon amatabout twoyards from thespot
where themedicine-man wasexpected totakeuphis
position. Having done so,and looking round, I
found that there were inallnine persons present
(including myself, butexclusive ofthePawang, his
wife, orthepatient), and Iwasinformed thatalthough
itisnotnecessary forthesame persons tobepresent
oneach ofthethree nights, thegreatest caremust
betaken toseethat thenumber ofpersons present,
which should never, instrictness, beaneven number,
does notvary from night tonight, because toallow

Imyself wasonlyenabled tobepresent asasubsti-

Meanwhile themedicine -man was notbackward
inhispreparations fortheproper reception ofthe
spirit. First hescattered incense ontheembers and
fumigated himself therewith, “shampooing” himself,
sotospeak, with hishands, and literally bathing
inthecloud ofincense which volumed upfrom the
newly-replenished censer andhung likeadense gray
mist over hishead. Next heinhaled theincense
through his nostrils, andannounced intheaccents
ofwhat iscalled the spirit- language (bhasa bantu)
thathewasgoing to“liedown.” This heaccord-
ingly did, reclining upon hisback, anddrawing the
upper endofhislong plaid sarong over hishead
soastocompletely conceal hisfeatures. The invo-
cation wasnotyetended, and forsome timewesat
inthesilence ofexpectation. Atlength, however,
themoment ofpossession arrived, andwith aviolent
convulsive movement, which was startling in its
suddenness, the “Pawang”rolled over ontohis
face. Again abrief interval ensued, and asecond
butsomewhat less violent spasm shook hisframe,
thespasm .being strangely followed byadryand
ghostly cough. Amoment later and thePawang,
stillwith shrouded head, was seated bolt upright
facing thetambourine player. Then hefronted round,
still inasitting posture, until hefaced thejars,and
removed theyam -leaf covering from themouth of

Next hekindled awaxtaper attheflame ofalamp

similar tapers having been kindled andplanted upon

tohimbyoneofthewomen present), crooning the
while tohimself.
This refreshment concluded, hedrew from his

shading, atthesame time, hiseyeswith hishand from
thelight ofthetapers. Henowcharmed several
handfuls ofrice(“parched,” “washed,” and“saffron”
rice), and after afurther inspection declared, inshrill,
unearthly accents, thateach ofthecoins was lying
exactly under itsownrespective taper, and thatthere-
fore his“child” (the sickman)wasverydangerously
ill,though hemight yetpossibly recover with theaid
ofthespirit. Next, scattering thericeround therow
ofjars (thetrack ofthe ricethusforming anellipse),
hebroke offseveral small blossom-stalks from asheaf
ofareca-palm blossom, andmaking them upwith
sprays ofchampaka into three separate bouquets,
placed oneofthese improvised nosegays ineach ofthe
three jars ofwater. Onthefloor attheback ofthe

rowofjarshenextdeposited apiece ofwhite cloth,
five cubits inlength, which hehad just previously
fumigated. Again drawing thedagger already re-
ferred to,thePawang nowsuccessively plunged itup
tothe hiltintoeach ofthethree bouquets (inwhich
hostile spirits might, Iwas told, possibly belurking).
Then seizing anunopened blossom-spathe oftheareca-
palm, heanointed the latter allover with “oil of
Celebes,” extracted thesheaf ofpalm-blossom from its
casing, fumigated it,and laid itgently across the
patient’s breast. Rapidly working himself upintoa
state ofintense excitement, andwith gestures ofthe
utmost vehemence, henowproceeded to“stroke” the
patient with thesheaf ofblossom rapidly downwards,
inthedirection ofthefeet,onreaching which hebeat
outtheblossom against thefloor. Then turning the
patient overontohisface,andrepeating thestroking
process, heagain beatouttheblossom, andthensank
back exhausted upon the floor, where helayface
downwards, with hishead oncemore enveloped inthe
folds ofthesarong.
Along interval now ensued, but atlength, after
many convulsive twitchings, theshrouded figure arose,
amid theintense excitement oftheentire company,
andwentupon itshands and feet.TheTiger Spirit
hadtaken possession ofthePawang’s body, and
presently alow, butstartlingly life-like growl—the
unmistakable growl ofthedreaded “Lord ofthe
Forest”—seemed toissue fromsomewhere under our
feet, astheweird shrouded figure began scratching
furiously atthematupon which ithadbeen quietly
lying, andthen, withoccasional pauses fortheemission
ofthegrowls, which hadpreviously startled us,andthe
performance ofwonderful cat-like leaps, rapidly licked


VI POSSESSION 443
upthehandfuls ofricewhich hadbeen thrown upon
thefloor infront ofit.This part oftheperformance
lasted, however, butafew minutes, andthen the
evident excitement oftheonlookers was raised to
fever pitch, asthe bizarre, and, as itseemed toour
fascinated senses, strangely brute-like form stooped
suddenly forward, andslowly licked over, asatigress
would lick itscub, the allbutnaked body ofthe
patient—aperformance (toaEuropean) ofsopower-
fully nauseating acharacter that itcanhardly be
conceived thatanyhuman being could persist in it
unless hewasmore orlessunconscious ofhisactions.
Atallevents, after hiscomplete return toconsciousness
attheconclusion oftheceremony, even thePawang
experienced asevere attack ofnausea, such asmight
wellbesupposed tobetheresult ofhisperformance.
Meanwhile, however, theceremony continued. Revert-
ingtoasitting posture (though stillwithshrouded
head), thePawang now leaned forward over the
patient, andwith thepoint ofhisdagger drew blood
from hisownarm;then rising tohisfeetheengaged
inafierce hand-to-hand combat with hisinvisible foe
(the spiritwhom hehadbeensummoned toexorcise).
Atfirst hisweapon wasthedagger, butbefore longhe
discarded this,andlaidabout himstoutly enough with
thesheaf ofareca-palm blossom.
Presently, however, hequieted down somewhat,
andcommenced to“stroke” thesickman (asbefore)
with thesheaf ofpalm -blossom, beating outthe
blossom upon the floor asusual attheendofthe
operation. Then sitting down again andcrooning to
himself, hepartook ofbetel-leaf, faced round towards
thepatient andstooped over him,muttering ashedid
so,andpassing hishands allover theprostrate form.


444 MEDICINE CHAP.
Next heturned once more tothejarsandagain
plunged hisdagger intoeach ofthem inturn (tomake
sure thattheevil spirit wasnotlurking inthem), and
thendrawing hishead-cloth over hishead soasto
completely hide hisface, heoncemore took hisseat
beside thepatient, stooping overhimfrom time to
timeandcrooning charms ashedidso.
Finally heclapped hishands, removed hishead-
cloth, “stroked”thepatient overandflicked himwith
thecorners of it,andthen shrouding himself once
more inthesarong,laydown atfulllength inastate
ofcomplete exhaustion. Apause ofabout tenminutes’
duration nowfollowed, andthenwithsundry convulsive
twitchings thePawang returned toconsciousness and
satup,andtheceremony wasover.
Thefollowing description ofaceremony similar to
theonejustdescribed istaken fromMalay Sketches :—
“The ber-hantu is,ofcourse, asurvival ofprse-

great repute inherowncountry andamong herown
people. Inordinary lifeshewasanamusing lady
named Raja Ngah, ascion ofthereigning house on
thefemale side,andamember ofafamily skilled inall
matters pertaining tooccultism. Inacorner ofthe
room were five orsixgirls holding native drums,
instruments with askin stretched over one side
only,and this isbeaten usually with thefingers. The
leader ofthisorchestra was thedaughter ofRaja
Ngah.
“Shortly after Isatdown, theproceedings began
bythePawang covering herhead and facewith a
silken cloth, while theorchestra began tosingaweird
melody inanunknown tongue. Iwastold itwasthe
spirit language;the airwasonespecially pleasing to
aparticular Jin, orSpirit, andtheinvocation, after
reciting hispraises, besought him tocome from the
mountains orthesea,from underground oroverhead,
andrelieve thetorments oftheKing.
“Asthesong continued, accompanied bythe
rhythmical beating ofthedrums, thePawang satwith
shrouded head infront ofthelighted taper, holding in
herrighthand against her leftbreast asmall sheaf of
thegrass called daunsambau,tiedtightly together and

became aware ofthis,andshemade obeisance tothe

;then, rising toherfeetand
followed bytheattendant, sheperformed thesame
ceremony before each malemember ofthereigning

string ofgibberish addressed totheSpirit. This done,
sheresumed herseatonthemat, and, after abrief
pause, theminstrels struck upadifferent air,and,
singing thepraises ofanother Jin ,called uponhimto
come andrelieve theKing’s distress.
“Iascertained thateachMalay State has itsown

Inthisparticular State there arefour principal Jin;

“There arecommon devils who look aftercom-

“Then there isKemala ajaib,the‘Wonderful Jewel,’

“Meanwhile asixteen-sided stand, about sixinches

the floor near thePawangs mat.
Thestand wasdecorated withyellow

delicacies specially prized byJin.
There was justroom tositonthis

shouted forhimwith alltheir might.
“TheSultan satthere forsome time, occasionally
giving aconvulsive shudder, andwhen this taper
hadduly flared up,and allthe riteshadbeen per-
formed, HisHighness wasconducted back again to

“Whilst striding across thefloor shesuddenly fell

“Just before dawn there wasasudden confusion

“TheKing didnotdie,after all—onthecontrary, I

tolive tillthemorning, andyethecheated Death—for

Theceremony called Mengalin, orthe “sucking
charm”ceremony, isonewhich isvery curious, and
deserves tobedescribed insome detail.
First ofallyouperform theceremony called “Driv-
ingouttheMischief”(buang badi)from thesick
man (vide supra) inorder todriveaway allevil spirits
(menolak sakalian chengkedi atau hantu). Then wrap
thepatient upinawhite orblack cloth, andtaking a
ballof(kneaded) dough(tepong pengalin),eggs and
saffron, repeat thesuitable charm, and roll itallover
theskin ofthepatient’s body inorder todraw out
allpoisonous influences(menchabut saga/a bisa-bisa).
Then ifyoufindinside theballofdough afteropening
itaninfinitesimally small splinter ofbone, orafew

Asecond charm ofgreat length follows, theobject
ofwhich istodrive outtheevil spirit inpossession of
theman.
Anexample ofthisform ofcure aspractised by
Malay medicine -men isreferred tobyMr. Clifford,
who, inspeaking ofhispunkah-puller, Umat, says:—
“Itwassoon after hismarriage that histrouble fell
uponUmat, andswept much ofthesunshine from his
life.Hecontracted aform ofophthalmia, and fora
timewas blind. Native Medicine Mendoctored him,
anddrewsheaves ofneedles andbunches ofthorns from
hiseyes, which they declared were thecause ofhis
affliction. These miscellaneous oddsandendsused to
bebrought tomeatbreakfast-time, floating, most un-
appetisingly, inashallow cup half-full ofwater;and
Umat went abroad witheye-sockets stained crimson or
black, according tothefancy ofthenative physician.
The aidofanEnglish doctor was called in,butUmat
wastoothoroughly aMalay totrust themore simple
remedies prescribed tohim,andthough hisblindness
wasrelieved, andhebecame able towalk without the
aidofastaff, hiseyesight could never really begiven
back tohim.”1
Intheabove connection Imayremark that,whether
from theworking oftheirown imaginations orother-
wise, those whowere believed tobepossessed by
demons certainly suffered, andthat severely. H.H.

Selangor, wasattacked byafamiliar demon during my
residence intheLangat District, andshortly after-
wards commenced topineaway. Hedeclared that
theoffending demon was sitting inhisskull, atthe
back ofhishead, andthat itdragged upanddevoured
everything thatheswallowed. Hence herefused at
length toeatany sortofsolid food, andgradually
wasted away until hebecame amere skeleton, and
went about imploring people totake ahatchet and
split hisskull open, inorder toextract thedemon
which hebelieved ittocontain. Gradually hisstrength
failed, and atlength Ilearned fromH.H. theSultan
(then RajaMuda) that alltheMalays intheneigh-
bourhood hadassembled towail athisdecease. As
westrolled among thecocoa-nut palms and talked, I
toldhim ofthemany miraculous cures which had
attended cases offaith-healing inEngland, andsug-
gested, notofcourse expecting tobetaken seriously,
thatheshould trythe effect ofsuch acureupon his
uncle, and“make believe” toextract some “man-
uses” from theback ofhishead. Tomyintense
astonishment some days later, Ilearned that thisidea
hadbeen carried outduring mytemporary absence
from the district, and that theMuhammadan priest,
aftercupping himseverely, hadshown himseven large
mantises which hepretended tohave extracted from
theback ofhishead. Theexperiment proved extra-
ordinarily successful, andRajaKahar recovered atall
events forthetime. Hedeclared, however, thatthere
weremore ofthese mantises left,andeventually suffered
arelapse anddiedduring myabsence inEngland on
leave. Forthetime, however, theimprovement was
quite remarkable, andwhen SaidMashahor, thePeng-
hulu ofKerling, visited himafewdays later, Raja


452 MEDICINE CHAP.
Kahar, afteranaccount ofthecurefrom hisownpoint
ofview, declared thatnobody would now believe that
hehadbeen so ill,although “nofewer thanseven large
mantises” hadbeen “extracted from hishead.”
Inowgive aspecimen oftheceremonies used for
recalling awandering soulbymeans ofadough figure
orimage (gambar tepong). Itisnotstated whether
anyoftheusual accessories ofthese figures (hairand
nails, etc.) aremixed with thedough, butanoldand
famous soul-doctor (’Che Amal, ofJugra) toldmethat
thedough figure should bemade, instrictness, from
theballofkneaded dough which isrolled allover the
patient’s bodybythemedicine-man during the“suck-
ing-charm”ceremony(mengalin ).The directions for
making itrunasfollows:—
Make animage ofdough, inlength about nine
inches, andrepresenting theopposite sextothat of
thepatient. Deposit it(on itsback) upon fivecubits
ofwhite cloth, which must befolded upsmall forthe
purpose, andthen plant aminiature green umbrella
(made ofcloth coated thickly with wax,andstanding
from four tofiveinches inheight) atthehead ofthe
image, andasmall green clove-shaped taper (ofabout
thesame height) atitsfeet.Then burn incense;take
three handfuls each of“parched,” “washed,” and
“saffron” rice,andscatter them thrice round thefigure,
saying asyoudoso:—
“OFlying Paper,

And theUmbrella ofSiLanchang isopposite tome
Grant thisbyvirtue of‘There isnogodbutGod/ ”etc.
Thestatement that thisdough image should repre-
senttheopposite sex tothat ofthepatient should be
received with caution, andrequires further investigation
toclear itup.Myinformant explained thatthe“Fly-
ingPaper ”
(kretas layang-layang) referred tothesoul-
cloth, andthe“cup”totheimage, but ifthisexplana-
tion isaccepted, itisyetnotunlikely that arealcup
wasused intheoriginal charm. The “drunken stars”
heexplained asreferring totheparched ricescattered
onhis left,andthe fullmoon totheeyes oftheimage.
Arguing from theanalogy ofother ceremonies con-
ducted onthesame lines, thewandering soulwould
berecalled andinduced toenter theso-called cup(i.e .
thedough image), andbeing transferred thence tothe
soul-cloth underneath it,would bepassed ontothe
patient inthesoul-cloth itself.
Another way torecall asoul(which wastaught me
by’Che‘Abas ofKelantan) istotakeseven betel-leaves
withmeeting leaf-ribs(sirihbertemu urat),andmake
them upintoseven “chews” ofbetel. Then take a

atthefeetofthesickman, giving himoneendof
thethread tohold,andfastening theother end tothe
egg-
The soul isthen called upon toreturn tothehouse
which ithasdeserted, iscaught inasoul-cloth, and
passed (itisthought) first ofallintotheegg,and
thence back into thepatient’s bodybymeans ofthe
thread which connects theeggwith thepatient. The
charm runs asfollows:—

“Peace bewith you,OBreath !

Hither, Filmy One,come hither!

Here Isitandpraise you.

Another wayofrecalling thesoul isasfollows:—
Putsome husked rice inarice-bag(sumpit)with
anegg,anail,andacandle- nut;scatter it
(kirei)thrice
round thepatient shead, and deposit thebag be-

Butreturn toyourownhome.”
When three days have expired, gather upthe rice
again andput itallback intothebag. Ifthere isa

could begiven oftheway inwhich theBlack Artand
themedical performances that intheirmethods closely
resemble it,areregarded bymany respectable Malays:—

Dance Ceremonies
Thefollowing passage isanaccount ofacharacter-

performers todance fortheiramusement, andconsider
that‘thebetter part’iswith thosewho watch, at
their ease, theexertions ofasmall class, whose
members arenotheld inthehighest respect. The
spectacle usually provided isstrangely wanting in
attraction :acouple ofwomen shuffling their feet
andswaying their hands ingestures that arepracti-
cally devoid ofgrace oreven variety—that isthe
Malay dance—and itisaccompanied bythebeating
ofnative drums, thestriking together oftwoshort
sticks held ineither hand, andtheoccasional boom
ofametal gong. The entertainment hasanun-
doubted fascination forMalays, but itgenerally forms
part ofatheatrical performance, and forWestern
spectators itisimmeasurably dull .1
“InoneoftheMalay States, however, Pahang, it
has foryears been thecustom fortheruler andone

rude indeed.

message came from theSultan inviting ustowitness

made ourway totheastana,apicturesque, well-built,
andcommodious house onthe right bank ofthe
Pahang river.Apalisade enclosed thecourtyard,
and thefront ofthehouse was avery large hall,
open onthree sides, butcovered byalofty roof of
fantastic design supported onpillars. The floor of
this hallwasapproached bythree wide steps con-
tinued round thethree open sides, thefourth being
closed byawooden wallwhich entirely shut offthe
private apartments save forone central door over
which hung aheavy curtain. The three steps were
toprovide sitting accommodation according totheir
rank forthose admitted totheastana. Themiddle
ofthe floor onthenight inquestion wascovered
byalarge carpet, chairs were placed forus,andthe
restoftheguests satonthesteps ofthedais.
“When weentered, wesaw, seated onthecarpet,
four girls, twoofthem about eighteen andtwoabout
eleven years old, allattractive according toMalay
ideas ofbeauty, and allgorgeously andpicturesquely
clothed. Ontheirheads theyeachwore alarge and
curious butvery pretty ornament ofdelicate workman-
ship—asort ofsquare flower garden where allthe
flowers were gold, trembling and glittering withevery

secured tothehead bytwisted cords ofsilver and
gold. The girls’ hair,combed down inafringe, was

becomingly dressed behind.
“Thebodices oftheir dresses weremade oftight-
fitting silk, leaving theneckandarms bare, whilst
awhite band offinecambric (about oneandahalf
inches wide), passing round theneck,camedown on
thefront ofthebodice intheform ofaV,andwas
there fastened byagolden flower. Round their
waists were belts fastened with large and curiously-
worked pinding orbuckles ofgold, solarge that
they reached quite across the waist. The rest
ofthecostume consisted ofaskirt ofcloth of
gold (not atalllike thesarong),reaching tothe
ankles, while ascarf ofthesame material, fastened
initscentre tothewaist-buckle, hungdown tothe
hem oftheskirt.
“Allfourdancers were dressed alike, except that
theolder girlswore white silkbodices with aredand
gold handkerchief, folded corner-wise, tiedunder the
armsandknotted infront. Thepoints ofthehandker-
chiefhung tothemiddle oftheback. Inthecaseofthe
twoyounger girls theentire dresswasofonematerial.
On their arms thedancers wore numbers ofgold
bangles, and their fingers were covered withdiamond
rings. Intheir earswere fastened thediamond
buttons somuch affected byMalays, andindeed now
byWestern ladies. Their feet, ofcourse, were bare.
We hadample time tominutely observe these
details before thedance commenced, forwhen we
came intothe hallthefour girls were sitting down
intheusual1Eastern fashion onthecarpet, bending
forward, their elbows resting ontheir thighs, and

hiding thesides oftheir faces, which were towards
theaudience, with fansmade ofcrimson and gilt
paper which sparkled inthelight.
“Onourentrance theband struck up,andour
special attention was called totheorchestra, asthe
instruments areseldom seen intheMalay Peninsula.
There were twochief performers :oneplaying ona
sort ofharmonicon, thenotes ofwhich hestruck
with pieces ofstick held ineach hand. The other,
with similar pieces ofwood, played oninverted metal
bowls. Both these performers seemed tohave suffici-
ently hard work, butthey played with thegreatest
spirit from 10p.m. till5a.m.
“Theharmonicon iscalled byMalays chelempong,
andtheinverted bowls, which give apleasant and
musical sound likethenoise ofrippling water, agam-
bang .Theothermembers oftheorchestra consisted
ofavery small boywho played, with avery largeand
thick stick, onagigantic gong, anoldwoman who
beat adrum withtwo sticks, and several other boys
whoplayed oninstruments liketriangles called chanang.
All these performers, wewere told with much
solemnity, were artists ofthe first order, masters anda
mistress intheir craft,and ifvigour ofexecution counts
forexcellence theyproved thejustice ofthepraise.
“The Hall, ofconsiderable size,capable ofaccom-
modating several hundreds ofpeople, wasonlydimly
lighted, butthe fact that, while theaudience was in
semi-darkness, thelightwasconcentrated ontheper-
formers added tothe effect. Besides ourselves, I
question whether there weremore than twenty spec-
tators, but sitting onthetopofthedais, near tothe

regard tothefeelings oftheaudience.
“From theelaborate andvehement execution ofthe
players, andthewant ofregular time inthemusic, I
judged, and rightly, thatwehadentered astheover-
turebegan. During itsperformance thedancers sat
leaning forward, hiding their faces as Ihave described
;
butwhen itconcluded and, without anybreak, the
music changed intotheregular rhythm fordancing,
thefour girlsdropped their fans, raised theirhands in
theactofSembah orhomage, andthen began the
dance byswaying their bodies andslowly waving their
arms andhands inthemost graceful movements
making much and effective use allthewhile ofthe
scarf hanging from their belts. Gradually raising
themselves from asitting toakneeling posture, act-
ing inperfect accord inevery motion, then rising
totheir feet,they floated through aseries offigures
hardly tobeexceeded ingrace and difficulty, con-
sidering thatthemovements areessentially slow, the
arms, hands, andbody being the real performers,
whilst thefeetarescarcely noticed and forhalfthe
time notvisible.
“They danced fiveorsixdances, each lasting quite
halfanhour, with materially different figures andtime
inthemusic. Allthese dances, Iwas told,weresym-
bolical :oneofagriculture, with thetilling ofthe soil,
thesowing oftheseed, thereaping andwinnowing of
thegrain, might easily have been guessed from the
dancer’s movements. Butthose oftheaudience whom

able togivememuch information. Attendants stood

thefingers thatthechief artofMalay dancers consists.
“The lastdance, symbolical ofwar,wasperhaps the
best, themusic being much faster, almost inspiriting,
andthemovements ofthedancers more freeandeven
abandoned. Forthelatter halfofthedance theyeach
held awand, torepresent asword, bound with three
rings ofburnished goldwhich glittered inthelight like
precious stones. This nautch, which began soberly like
theothers, grew toawild revel until thedancers were,
orpretended tobe,possessed bytheSpirit ofDancing,

amoment tosmear their fingers and faces with a
fragrant oil,they returned, andthetwo eldest, striking
ateach other with theirwands, seemed inclined toturn

ever, aftersome trouble, caught byfourorfivewomen
andcarried forcibly outoftheHall, butnotuntil their
captors hadbeenmade tofeeltheweight ofthemagic
wands. Thetwoyounger girls,wholooked asifthey
toowould like tobe“possessed,” butdidnotknow
how toaccomplish it,were easily caught andremoved.
“The bands, whose strains hadbeen increasing in
wildness and intime, ceased playing ontheremoval of
thedancers, andthenautch, which hadbegun at10
p.m.,wasover.

The religious origin ofalmost allMalay dances is
stilltobeseen intheperformance ofsuch ritualistic
observances astheburning ofincense, thescattering
ofrice,andtheinvocation oftheDance-spirit accord-
ingtocertain setforms, thespirit being duly exorcised
again (or“escorted homewards,” asitiscalled) atthe
endoftheperformance.
Thedances which have best preserved theolder
ritual areprecisely those which aretheleast often seen,
such asthe “Gambor Dance ”
(main gambor), the
“Monkey Dance ”
(main b'rok),the “Palm-blossom
Dance” (main mayang), andthe“Fish-trap Dance”
(main Inkah). These Iwill take intheorder
mentioned.
The “Gambor Dance ”(lit.Gambor Play) should
beperformed bygirls justentering uponwomanhood.
ThecUbutante isattired inanattractive coatandskirt
(sarong), isgirtabout atthewaist with ayellow (royal)
sash,and isfurther provided with anelaborate head-
dress, crescent-shaped pendants (dokoh) forthebreast,
and afan.The only other “necessary” isthe
“Pleasure-garden” (taman bunga), which isrepre-
sented byalarge water-jar containing abunch oflong
sprays, from theends ofwhich aremade todepend
artificial flowers, fruit, and birds, thewhole being
intended toattract the spirit (Hantu Gambor). In
addition there istheusual circular tray, with itscom-
plement ofsacrificial riceand incense. Everything

being ready, thedebutante liesdown and iscovered
over with asheet, andincense isburnt, the sacrificial
rice sprinkled, and theinvocation ofthe spirit is
chanted byawoman totheaccompaniment ofthe
tambourines. Ere ithasended, ifallgoes well, the
charm willhave begun towork, the spirit descends,
andthedance commences.
Attheendofthisdance, ashasalready been said,
thespirit isexorcised, that is,he is“escorted back”
totheseventh heaven fromwhence hecame.
The invocations, which areusedboth atthecom-
mencement andtheconclusion oftheperformance,
consist ofpoems which belong unmistakably tothe
“Panji”cycle ofstories;hereandthere they contain
oldwords which are stillused inJava.
The “Monkey Dance” isachieved bycausing the
“Monkey spirit”toenter intoagirlofsome tenyears
ofage. She isfirstrocked toand froinaMalay
infant’s swinging-cot(buayan\ andfedwith areca-nut
and salti^pinang garam). When she issufficiently
dizzy or“dazed ”
(mabok),aninvocation addressed
tothe “Monkey spirit”ischanted (totambourine
accompaniments), andatitsclose thechildcommences
toperform adance, inthecourse ofwhich she issaid
sometimes toachieve some extraordinary climbing
feats which shecould never have achieved unless
“possessed.” When itistime forhertorecover her
senses she iscalled uponbyname, and ifthat fails to
recall her, isbathed alloverwithcocoa-nut milk(ayer

aspecies ofiron spits, whose upper ends arefurnished
with hoops, uponwhich small ironrings arestrung, and
which accordingly giveoutajingling noisewhen shaken.
Two ofthese spits (buah dabus) arecharmed (to
deaden their bite), andtaken up,one ineach hand, by
thedancer, who shakes them ateach step thathe
takes. When heisproperly possessed, hedrives the
points ofthese spitsthrough themuscle ofeach fore-
arm,and letsthem hangdown whilst hetakes upa
second pair.Hethenkeeps allfour spits jingling at
once until thedance ceases. The point ofeach spit
goes right through themuscle, but ifskilfully done,
draws noblood .1
Wenowcome toaclass ofdances inwhich
certain inanimate objects, that arebelieved tobe
temporarily animated, aretheperformers, andwhich
therefore closely correspond totheperformances of
ourown spiritualists.
ThePalm-blossom dance isavery curious exhibi-
tion, which Ionce sawperformed intheLangat
District ofSelangor. Two freshly-gathered sheaves of
areca-palm blossom (each several feet inlength) were
deposited upon anewmat,near atraycontaining a
censer andthethree kinds ofsacrificial rice.
Themagician (’Che Ganti byname) commenced
theperformance byplaying aprelude onhisviolin.

VI THEPALM-BLOSSOM DANCE 467
Presently hiswife (anaged Selangor woman) took
some oftherice inherhandandcommenced tochant
thewords oftheinvocation, shebeing almost immedi-
ately joined inthechant byayounger woman.
Starting with thewords, “Thus Ibrace up, Ibrace up
thePalm-blossom ”(’kuanggit mayang 'kuanggit),
their voices rosehigher andhigher until theseventh
stanza wasreached, when theoldwoman covered the
twosheaves ofPalm-blossom with aMalay plaid skirt
{sarong) andtheusual “five cubits ofwhite cloth”
(folded double), both ofwhich had ofcourse first
been fumigated. Then followed seven more stanzas
(“Borrow thehammer, Borrow the anvil,” and its
companion verses), and ricehaving been thrown over
oneofthesheaves ofpalm-blossom, itssheath was
opened andthecontents fumigated. Then theold
woman took thenewly-fumigated sheaf between her
hands, andthechant recommenced with the third
septet ofstanzas (“Dig up,digup,thewild ginger
plant ”),astheerect palm-blossom swayed from side
toside intime tothemusic. Finally thefiddle stopped
andtambourines were substituted, and atthispoint
thesheaf ofblossom commenced tojump about onits
stalk, asifitwere indeed possessed, andeventually
dashed itself upon theground. After one ortwo
repetitions ofthisperformance, other persons present
were invited totry it,anddidsowithvarying success,
which depended, Iwas told,upon theimpressionability
oftheir souls, asthepalm-blossom would notdance
foranybody whose soulwasnotimpressionable (lemah
semangat).
When the firstblossom-sheaf hadbeen destroyed
bytherough treatment which ithad toundergo, the
second was duly fumigated and introduced tothe

company, and finally theperformance wasbrought to
aclose bythechanting ofthestanzas inwhich the
spirit isrequested toreturn tohisown place. The
twospoiled sheaves ofblossom were then carried re-
spectfully outofthehouse and laidontheground
beneath abanana-tree.
TheDancing Fish-trap (main lukah)isaspiritual-
isticperformance, inwhich afish-trap(lukah)issub-
stituted forthesheaf ofpalm-blossom, andadifferent
invocation isused. Inother respects there isvery little
difference between thetwo. The fish-trap isdressed
upmuch inthesameway asa“scare-crow,” soasto

figure, i.e. itisdressed inawomans coatand plaid

beenworn previously;astick isrunthrough itto
serve asthearms ofthefigure, anda(sterile) cocoa-nut
shell(tempurong jantan)clapped onthetoptoserve
asahead. The invocation isthen chanted inthe
samemanner andtothesame accompaniment asthat
used forthe“Palm-blossom.” At itsconclusion the
magician whispers, sotospeak, intothefish-trap’s ear,
bidding it“nottodisgrace him,” butriseupanddance,
andthefish-trap presently commences torock toand fro,
andtoleapabout inamanner which ofcourse proves
ittobe“possessed” bythe spirit. Two different
specimens oftheinvocations used willbefound inthe
Appendix.

“The bulls have been trained andmedicined for
months beforehand, withmuch careful tending, many
strength-giving potions, andvolumes oftheold-world
charms, which putvalour andcourage into abeast.
They stand ateachendofapiece ofgrassy lawn, with

talk,andnoonelistens towhatanyoneelse issaying,
thegreen sward onwhich thecombat istotake
place speedily becomes apandemonium, compared
withwhich theTower ofBabel wasaquiet corner in
Sleepy Hollow.
“Atlasttheword tobegin isgiven, andthekeepers
ofthebuffaloes letoutthelinesmade fasttothebulls’

drawn taut, sothat the bulls aresoon facing one

these fencing matches. Each beast gives way the

When atlastafirm griphasbeen won,andthehorn

thehighest level possible, and hismassive neck strains
andquivers with thetremendous effort. Ifthestab is
sufficiently lowdown, say intheneck orunder the
cheek-bone, thewounded bull isoften lifted clean off
hisfore-feet, andhangs there helpless andmotionless
‘while amanmight count ascore.’ The exertion of
lifting, however, istoogreat toadmit ofitsbeing
continued foranylength oftime, and assoon asthe
wounded buffalo regains itspower ofmotion—that is

Chiefs andpeople ofPahang would beadistinct breach
oftheunderstanding onwhich British Protection was

tointerfere with native customs, and thesports in
which animals areengaged areamong themost
cherished institutions ofthepeople ofPahang. To
fully appreciate the light inwhich any interference
with these things would beviewed bythe native
population, itisnecessary toput oneself inthe
position ofakeenmember oftheQuorn, whosaw

that thesufferings inflicted onthefoxrendered itan

hishatred ofdefeat alone urgehim tocontinue the

stern, inexorable necessity. This itiswhich makes
fights between animals, that areproperly conducted,
lesscruel thanone isapttoimagine.”2
Iwillnow pass tothesubject ofcock-fighting, of
which thefollowing vivid description isalsotaken from
Mr. Clifford’s InCourtandKampong .3
“IntheArchipelago, andontheWest Coast ofthe
Peninsula, cock-fights areconducted inthemanner
known totheMalays asber-taji,thebirds being armed
with long artificial spurs, sharp asrazors, andcurved
likeaMalay woman’s eyebrow. These weapons make
cruel wounds, andcause thedeath ofone orother
ofthecombatants almost before thesport haswell
begun. TotheMalay oftheEastCoast thisform of
cock-fighting isregarded asstupid andunsportsman-
like, anopinion which Ifully share. It isthe
marvellous pluck andendurance ofthebirds thatlend

more orless, butbirds arenotalone
in this. The little, wide-mouthed,
goggled -eyed fishes, which Malay
ladies keep inbottles andoldkerosine

aninterest toacock-fight—qualities which areinno
wayrequired ifthebirds arearmed withweapons other
than those withwhich they arefurnished bynature.
“Acock-fight between twowell-known birds isa
serious affair inPahang. The rival qualities ofthe
combatants have furnished food forendless discussion
forweeks, oreven months, before, andevery oneof
standing hasvisited andexamined thecocks, andhas
made abook upon theevent. Onthedayfixed for
thefight acrowd collects before thepalace, andsome
oftheKing’s youths setupthecock-pit, which isa
ring, about three feet indiameter, enclosed bycanvas
walls, supported onstakes driven into theground.
Presently theJuara, orcock-fighters, appear, each
carrying hisbirdunder his leftarm. They enter the
cock-pit, squat down, andbegin pulling at,andsham-
pooing thelegsandwings oftheir birds, inthemanner
which Malays believe loosen themuscles, andgetthe
reefs outofthecocks’ limbs. Then theword isgiven
tostart thefight, andthebirds, released, flystraight
atoneanother, striking with their spurs, andsending
feathers flying inalldirections. This lasts forperhaps
three minutes, when thecocks begin tolosetheir wind,
andthefight iscarried onasmuch with theirbeaks as
with their spurs. Each bird tries toget itsheadunder
itsopponent’s wing, running forward tostrike atthe
back ofitsantagonist’s head, assoon as itsown
emerges from under itstemporary shelter. This is
varied byanoccasional blow with thespurs, andthe
Malays herald each stroke withloud cries ofapproval.
Basah !Bdsah !‘Thou hastwetted him !Thou hast
drawn blood!’ Ahitudia!iThat isit!That isa
good one !’Ahsakit-lah itu!‘Ah,thatwasanasty

efforts, amid occasional burst ofthe shrill chorus of
yells, called sorak, their backers cheering them on,and
crying tothembyname.
“Presently time iscalled, thewatch being asmall
section ofcocoa-nut inwhich ahole hasbeen bored,
that issetfloating onthesurface ofajarofwater,
until itgradually becomes filled and sinks. Atthe
word, each cock-fighter seizes hisbird, drenches it
with water, cleans outwithafeather thephlegm which
hascollected initsthroat, andshampoos itslegsand
body. Then, atthegiven word, thebirds areagain
released, andthey flyatoneanother withrenewed
energy. They lose their wind more speedily this
time, and thereafter they pursue the tactics already
described untiltime isagain called. When some ten
rounds have been fought, andboth thebirds are
beginning toshow signs ofdistress, theinterest ofthe
contest reaches itsheight, forthefight isatanend if
either bird raises itsback feathers inapeculiar manner,
bywhich cocks declare themselves tobevanquished.
Early inthetenth round theright eye-ball ofonecock
isbroken, and, shortly after, the lefteye isbunged up,
sothat forthetime itisblind. Nevertheless, it
refuses tothrow upthesponge, andfights ongallantly
totheendoftheround, taking terrible punishment,
anddoing but littleharm toitsopponent. Onecannot
butbefullofpityandadmiration forthebrave bird,
which thus gives somarvellous anexample ofits
pluck andendurance. Atlasttime iscalled, andthe
cock-fighter who isincharge oftheblinded bird, after
examining itcarefully, asks foraneedle andthread,
andtheswollen lower lidofthe stilluninjured eye-ball
issewn tothepiece ofmembrane onthebird’s cheek,
and itssight isthus once more partially restored.


478 DANCES, SPORTS, ANDGAMES CHAP.
Again time iscalled, andthebirds resume their con-
test, thecock with the injured eye repaying its
adversary sohandsomely forthepunishment which it
hadreceived intheprevious round, that, before the
cocoa-nut shell ishalf fullofwater, itsopponent has
surrendered, andhasimmediately been snatched up
bythekeeper incharge of it.The victorious bird,
draggled andwoebegone, with great patches ofred
flesh showing through itswetplumage, with the
membrane ofitsfaceand itsshort gillsandcomb
swollen andbloody, withoneeyeput out,andthe
other only keptopen bythethread attached toits
eyelid, yetmakes shift tostrut, with staggering gait,
across thecock-pit, andtonotify itsvictory bygiving
vent toalamentable ghost ofacrow. Then itis
carried offfollowed byanadmiring, gesticulating,
vociferous crowd, tobeelaborately tended andnursed,
asbefits sogallant abird. The beauty ofthe
sport isthat either bird canstop fighting atany
moment. They arenever forced tocontinue the
conflict ifonce theyhave declared themselves defeated,
andtheonly realelement ofcruelty isthusremoved.
The birds infighting follow theinstinct which nature
hasimplanted inthem, and their marvellous courage
andendurance surpass anything tobefound inany
other animals, human orotherwise, withwhich Iam
acquainted. Most birds fightmore orless—from the
little fierce quail tothesucking doves which ignorant
Europeans, before their illusions have been dispelled
byasojourn intheEast, areaccustomed toregard as
theemblems ofpeace and purity;butnobird, or
beast, orfish, orhuman being fights sowell, ortakes
such pleasure inthefierce joyofbattle, asdoesaplucky,
lanky, ugly, hard-bit oldfighting-cock.


VI WESTCOAST CUSTOMS 479
“TheMalays regard these birds withimmense
respect, andvalue their fighting-cocks next totheir
children. Afewyears ago, aboy,whowas incharge
ofacockwhich belonged toaRaja ofmyacquaintance,
accidentally pulled some feathers from thebird’s tail.
‘What didyoudothat for ?Devil !’cried the
Raja.
“‘Itwasnotdone onpurpose, Ungku /’saidthe
boy.
“‘Thou artmarvellous clever atrepartee !’quoth
thePrince, and,sosaying, helifted abillet ofwood,
which chanced tobelying near athand, andsmote the
boyonthehead sothathedied.
“‘That willteachmypeople tohave acarehow
theyusemyfighting-cocks !’saidtheRaja;and that
was hisservant’s epitaph.
“‘Itisamere boyish prank,’ saidthefather ofthe
young Raja,when thematter wasreported tohim,
‘and,moreover, itiswell thatheshould slayoneor
twowith hisownhand, elsehow should men learn to
fearhim ?’And there thematter ended;but itshould
beborne inmind that thefighting-cock ofaMalay
Prince isnottobelightly trifled with.”
Oftheform ofcock-fighting practised ontheWest
Coast ofthePeninsula Newbold writes :—
“Thefollowing isaspecimen from aMalay MS.
onthe subject, commencing with remarks onthe
various breeds ofthisnoble bird:—

observe that theMalays generally useone spur;
though twospurs aresometimes given tomatch a

“Ionce witnessed agrand contest between two
Malayan States atthebreaking upoftheRamazan
fast. Most ofthecock-fighters presented themselves
attheGolongan orcock-pit with agame-cock under
each arm. The birdswere nottrimmed asinEng-
land, butfought infullfeather. The spurs usedon
thisoccasion were about twoandahalfinches long, in
shape liketheblade ofascythe, andwere sharpened
onthespotbymeans ofafinewhetstone;large gashes
were inflicted bythese murderous instruments, and it
rarely happened thatboth cocks survived the battle.
Cocks ofthesame colour areseldom matched. The
weight isadjusted bythesetters-to passing them to
andfrom each other’s hands asthey sitfacing each
other intheGolongan. Should there beany differ-
ence, itisbrought down toanequality bythespur
being fixed somany scales higher onthelegofthe
heavier cock, oraccording torules adverted to,as
deemed fairbyboth parties. One spur only isused,
and isgenerally fastened near thenatural spuronthe
inside ofthe leftleg. Inadjusting these preliminaries

Games
“Gambling ofvarious descriptions, both with dice
andwith cards, ismuch invogue. These, aswell as
thepoe-table, have been introduced bytheChinese,
who areeven greater adepts than theMalays inall
that relates tothispernicious vice.
“Saparaga2isagame resembling football, played by

great merriment.

“Thegames played bychildren areTujoh Lobang,2

Of allminor games, top-spinning and kite-flying
areperhaps themost popular. The kites arecalled
layang-layang,which means a“swallow,” butare
sometimes ofgreat size,onewhich wasbrought to

thatno“tail” isrequired, thekitebeing steadied by
means ofabeak which projects forward atthetop

with athin, horizontal slip ofbamboo(dengong)

The phrase Tengah tiang (half mast), again, is
applied totwenty-five pips held irrespective ofthe

obtained, theplayer issaid tobeout(matz, ormasok

3.Daun tiga ’leiorPakciu isplayed here as

Three cards aredealtbythedealer toeach player,

pips, with certain exceptions.
The besthand isthree aces (tiga sat).
Thenext isthree threes (tigajalor).
Thenext isthree tens (tigapuloli).
The next isthree court-cards (tigaangkong ortiga

Ofother hands thebest isaremainder ofnine pips

The next isaremainder ofeight pips, and so
on.
Ahand ofthree threes, itwillbeobserved, isthe

according toSirW.E.Maxwell, itisthrown away as
theworst.
The stakes, which aredeposited intwoheaps
byeach player, arehere called kapala or“head,”
andbuntut (orekor),the“tail,” respectively; the
kapala being generally, though perhaps notalways,
greater than theekor inSelangor, instead ofthe
reverse. The latter canonlybelostwhen aplayer

Children's Games
Iwillnowgivesome specimens ofthegames I
have seenplayed bychildren:—
“Throwing theFlower across” (champak bunga
sa-Ulah) isagame which Ihave seen thus played by
boys.
Ahandkerchief wastwisted up(like arope) from
corner tocorner, folded inhalf,andthen tiedtogether
attheends.
Two couples stood facing oneanother atafew
yards’ distance, and atagiven signal oneoftheboys
ineach couple took hiscompanion upontohisshould-
ers.Thetwowhoweremounted threw thehandker-
chief across toeach other, andback again byturns.
When theone failed tocatch it,both riders dis-
mounted andoffered backs totheir late“mounts,” who
thusbecame riders, andthrew thehandkerchief in
their turn. Each time, however, that acatch was
made both parties crossed over. When three catches
were made inunbroken succession(kelerik)the
riders hadtheprivilege ofbeing carried across three
times before recommencing play.
Ishould addthatacoinwastossed upattheout-
setofthegame todecide whowere tostart asthe
riders, andwhowere tobetheridden.
Main Sesel (orKachau kueJi) bears astrong
family resemblance toourown“Hen andchickens.”
When Iwitnessed it,abigboyplayed the “Pater-
familias”with astring ofchildren athisback, each of
whom washolding ontotheone infront ofhim.
Presently a“Cakeseller ”presented himself, andthe
following conversation ensued:—


VI CHILDREN’S GAMES 495
Paterfamilias :Adakueh ?(Have youanycake ?)
Cakeseller :Ada. (Ihave.)
P.F. :Buleh akuEli? (Can Ibuysome ?)
C. :Buleh. (Yes.)
Here theCakeseller hands aballofearth toPater-
familias, whopasses itdown thelineofchildren tothe
youngest child attheendoftherow. The conversa-
tionthenrecommenced—
Cakeseller :Akumintd duit. (Iwantmymoney.)
P.F. :Duit fada, anak kunchi tinggal dijamban. (Ihave got
nomoney, Ihave mislaid thekey.) Kalau mahu ambil budak,
ambilyang di-b’lakang. (Ifyouwish totakeoneofmychildren,
take the last.)
Here adesperate effortwasmade bythepoorCake-
seller tododge past Paterfamilias andget attheboy,
whom heeventually succeeded incarrying off.
Main Tul isagame somewhat resembling our
own “Puss inthecorner,” butwith onlyone“home.”
The“home”consisted ofastake planted upright, and
the first “Puss”(prang tul)wasselected byaspecies
ofdivination depending upon repetition ofthesame
formula asisused toselect theblindman inBlind
Man’s Buff(Main China Buta). There was(as Ihave
said) onlyonehome inthisgame, from which the
players sallied forth totaunt theorang tul
,and
which theywere obliged totouch inorder tosave
themselves when closely pursued.
Main Seladang (Wild Bullgame) isanexcellent
game forchildren with theshoeless feetoftheEast.
A“wild bull”having been selected byrepetition of
thePing hilang formula, went upon allfours, and
entered intothefollowing conversation between him-
selfandoneoftheother players specially selected for
thepurpose. The latter opened negotiations with the
clearly non-committal, ifnotvery lucid remark, “Tam

tamkul towhich the“Bull”replied, “Buat apaguna
bakul ”(What areyougoing todowithyour basket?)
Boy :Mengisi arang. (Tohold charcoal.)
Bull :Buat apagunaarang ?(What willyoudowith thechar-
eoal?)
Boy :Menempa (ormasak) lembing. (Ishall forge aspear.)
Bull :Buat apaguna lembing ?(What usewillyoumake of
thespear?)
Boy :Menikam seladang. (Tostababull with.)
Bull (who isgetting excited) :Buat apaguna di-tikam ?(What
usewill itbetostabhim ?)
Boy :Mengambil hati-nya. (Togethisheart.)
Bull (who isnow fairly savage) :Buat apaguna hati-nya ?
(What usewillyoumake ofhisheart ?)
Boy :Buat santap RajaMuda. (Get theCrown Prince topar-
take (ofit).)
The Bull attheendofthisbaiting wasready to
“charge”anybody andeverything, anddidaccordingly
runattherestoftheplayers, kicking outwith allhis
might atanybody whocame near. Ashehad to
move onallfours hecould notgovery fast,andthe
other players took advantage ofthis tobaithim still
further byslapping himonthebackandjumping over
him. Whenever theycame nearenough helashed
outwith hisheels, andwhen hesucceeded inkicking
another player below theknee, the latter became a
Bull inhisturn. Much agility isdisplayed inthis
game, which isthoroughly enjoyed bytheplayers.
“Blind Man’s Buff” (Main China Buta,or“Blind
Chinaman ”)isplayed inexactly thesamemanner as
ourown Blind Man’s Buff; oneoftheparty, with
bandaged eyes, being required tocatch anyonewho
comes nearhim.
The firstblindman—atthecommencement ofthe
game—ischosen asfollows: theintending players
sitdown together inaclose circle, each ofthem
putting down the tips oftheir forefingers inthe


VI NURSERY RHYMES 497
centre ofthe circle;then somebody who isnot
playing tapseach ofthem onthehead inturn, re-
peating ateach tapaword ofthefollowing formula:—

disappear.
Themeaning ofthisformula (as isthecasewith
somany “nursery” rhymes) isvery obscure, several
words being unintelligible oratleast doubtful. Itis,
however, theregular formula used forsuchgames and
isquitecommon.1
Chan chan sikurembat isagame which Isaw
played inSelangor asfollows:—
The intending players stood inarow, looking
straight infront ofthem, butwith their hands behind
their backs, whilst another boy,whohadapiece of

10.THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS
TheMalay Drama, taking theword initswidest
sense ascomprising every kind oftheatrical exhibition,
includes performances ofseveral different types, which
derive their origin from various distinct sources. Most
ofthem bearsome traces oftheir foreign extraction,
andthough theyhave beenmuch modified bythe
Malays, and arenow quite “naturalised”inthe
Peninsula, itispretty clear thatthegreater parthave
been borrowed from India, Siam, China, andpossibly
other countries. Itisnoteworthy thatmany, perhaps
most, oftheplots represented inthese performances


504 THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS CHAP.
owe their origin totheoldclassical Indian Epics, and
especially tothestory oftheRamayana, which hasbeen
handed down traditionally, much modified bylocal
colouring, inJavaandSiam aswell asintheMalay
Peninsula.
Itisnotwithin thescope ofthiswork togiveany-
thing likeafulldescription ofthese different kinds of
dramatic representations, but itisdesirable togive
some account ofthe ritual which accompanies them,
andtheideas and superstitions which theyseem to
involve.
Themost important oftheceremonies which relate
totheMalay theatre isthatofinaugurating or“open-
ing”(as itiscalled) asitefortheperformance. The
following isanaccount (byMr.Hugh Clifford) ofthe
performance ofthisceremony:—
“When oneofthese companies arrives ataplace
where itintends to‘open,’ iterects asmall, square
shed, open atallfour sides, butcarefully roofed in,and
withahand-rail running round itabout two feetfrom
theground. This shed iscalled aBangsal, andthe
space which itssides enclose istermed Panggong. Be-
foretheplay begins, theceremony called Buka Pang-
gong *,which has for itsobject theinvocation and
propitiation ofcertain spirits, isgone through. . . .
“Theceremony, which isacurious one, isper-
formed inthefollowing manner :Thecompany having
entered theshed andtaken their seats, abrazier is
placed infront ofthePawang;orMedicine- Man,who
isalsothehead ofthetheatrical troop. Inthisbrazier
precious woods and spices areburned, andwhile the
incense ascends, thePdwang intones thefollowing
incantation, theothermembers ofthetroop repeating
eachsentence inchorus asheconcludes it.

supposed tocontain, andthen arises andbegins toact
hispart.”1
Asimilar ceremony waswitnessed in1897byMr.
Everard Fielding andthepresent writer attheback
oftheBungalow atJugra (inSelangor). The object
oftheceremony was todrive away evil spirits from
thespotwhere theperformance was totake place,
and theperformers were alittle band ofplayers
from Penang who had settled intheneighbour-
hood andhadplanted their holdings with Liberian
coffee.
ThePawang ormagician inthisinstance wasa
Malay named ’Che Hussein, whoacted asclown, and
subsequently wrote out atmyrequest rough tran-
scripts ofmore thanadozen oftheplays acted byhis
company.
Abigmat ormats having been laidupon the
ground inaspot carefully selected forthepurpose, four
corner posts were planted andabigawning orceiling-
cloth(langit-langit)stretched between them. The
square space between thepostswasthenfenced offby
carrying acouple ofcords round ithorizontally from
post topost,one attheheight oftwo,andtheother
about five feetabove theground. From these cords
were suspended various ornamental objects made of
plaited strips ofcocoa-nut leaf,fashioned intorough
resemblances ofanimals, birds, fruitandflowers, afew
bananas being added atintervals, these latter serving
aslight refreshments fortheplayers whenever they
feltsominded. Stems ofbanana trees with their
leaves fastened ateach postmade thestructure com-
plete, andthegeneral effect, enhanced bythebright

daggers, andother “properties”ofthecompany, until
theywere wellfumigated. Henext lighted three tapers,

kinds, andvary considerably indifferent places. The
Joget, akind ofdramatic andsymbolical dance, has
been described under thehead ofDances. The
Mdyong isatheatrical performance which includes
both dancing (orposturing asEuropeans would be
tempted tocall it)and singing. It isgenerally
performed bytravelling companies ofprofessional
actors and actresses, whogoontourandperform
either atthehouses ofRajas orother persons of
some social standing, orbefore thegeneral public in
some public place .1
Just asthedances oftheJoget
aresupposed tobesymbolical ofdifferent actions
andideas, andareaccompanied byappropriate music,
sointheMdyong there isquite along listoftunes,
each ofwhich isconsidered tobeappropriate toa
particular action, ortosome one ormore ofthe
dramatis persona. Infact,onemay almost saythat
wehave here, inprinciple, therudegerm ofthe
Wagnerian Leitmotif. Thus when one ofthe
performers issupposed tobesent tosleep, theLagu
Legor Radin istheoneused;intherepresentation
ofadeath, theLaguMerayu;
when acharacter is
supposed tobeentering thejungle, theLaguSamsam ;
when anyone sitsdown, theLagu Patani Tuah.
Similarly theLaguPuyuh,theLaguDang Dondang

ofthestock characters ofthis species ofplay, while
other tunes canbeused onlybythePrincess andthe

again, areemployed indifferently toaccompany anyof
theparts, whether prince, princess, clown (P’ran), or

514 THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS CHAP.
The costumes oftheperformers inthevarious
kinds ofdramatic exhibitions vary, ofcourse, with the
subject-matter oftherepresentation. The clown’s
masks andtheforest demon (hantu hutan), ofwhich
illustrations aregiven, will serve asspecimens to
indicate thenature ofsome oftheaccessories inuse.
Afairly full listoftheirMalay names willbefound
intheclassification given below.
TheMayong isperhaps themost typical form of
Malay theatrical representations, butanother very
characteristic performance istheShadow- Play, pro-
perly termed Wayang, aname thathasbeen loosely
extended tocover theatrical exhibitions ingeneral.
“The show iscalled Wayang Kulit,orleather
puppets. Itisexhibited inarough shed, which has
aflooring raised about three feetfrom theground
;
thebuilding isusually twenty feetsquare andenclosed
onthree sides, thefront alone being open;across
thisopening awhite sheet isstretched onwhich the
shadows ofthepuppets arethrown andseen through
bytheaudience;thelatter sitorstand intheopen
air.
“The show seems tobeofHindu origin, ifwe
mayjudge from thestrong resemblance thefigures
bear totherepresentations ofgods andgoddesses
worshipped bytheHindus ofIndia; itisprobably
obtained from Java.
“The figures aremade ofbuffalo hide, andthe
arms alone aremovable;they aremoved byslips of
wood attached tothem, which arevery clumsily
contrived, and astheir shadows areseen with
thepuppets the effect isvery much destroyed.
Various scenes ofadomestic nature areexhibited,
andthey take theshape ofaplay, butwithnodefinite

plot running through orconnecting the different
scenes.
“Thefollowing isaspecimen:—
“An oldmanappears weeping foralong-lost son,
andmoves toand froforsome time bewailing his
loss;theshowman speaks each figure’s part, and
alters thetone ofhisvoice tosuittheageofthe
speaker;asecond figure comes on,representing a
young manarmed with akrisywhoendeavours to
pick aquarrel with the firstcomer, andtheconver-
sation iswitty and characteristic, eliciting roars of
laughter from thelookers-on;afight ensues, andthe
oldman iswounded;hefallsand cries outthatwere
heayoung man, orifhislostsonwere present, his
adversary should notthustriumph over him. Inhis
conversation hehappens tomention hisson’sname
;
theyoung man intimates that hisname isthesame,
anexplanation ensues, and itends bytheoldman
discovering inhislateadversary hislong-lost son.
The oldfellow weeps andlaughs alternately, caresses
hissonfrequently, anddeclares they shall never part
again;thescene endsbytheyouth shedding tears
over hislateinhuman conduct, andhefinally walks
offwith theoldgentleman onhisback.
“The conversation iscarried onsolely inthe
Malayan dialect. Warlike scenes please most :a
warrior comes onthestage and challenges hisin-
visible enemy tomortal combat;suddenly another
figure comes onattheopposite sideandadesperate
fight ensues, which lasts foraverylong time, andends
inoneofthecombatants being killed. Occasionally
abattle inwhich tenortwelve figures jointakes place,
and forhours willtheMalays lookonatsuch scenes.
“Theshow concludes withanexhibition ofvarious

animals—deer, horses, tigers, crocodiles, etc., also
birds and fishes. The figures areperforated to
represent theeyes, shape ofthedress, etc.
“Attheback oftheshed, concealed bythesheet,
sitthemusicians, whokeep upanincessant dinon
drums andcymbals.”1
Thepuppets forthese shadow-plays areusually cut
outofdeer-skin (not buffalo hide) and itisworth re-
marking thatthey are allconsidered tobemore or
lessanimated;astringent propitiatory ceremony hasto
beperformed intheir honour, incense being burnt and
ricescattered about, just asintheMayong ceremony
already described.
Thepresent writer, while inSelangor, bought from
aKelantan Malay named ’Che ‘Abas, aperformer of
shadow-plays, hisentire stock-in-trade, including not
only hismusical instruments (amongst which were
some curious drums called geduandgedombak butalso
hiscandle (with itsshade), thericeused forthecere-
mony, and hisentire stock ofshadow-pictures, allof
which arenow intheCambridge Museum.
Thefollowing classification ofthemore important
kinds oftheatrical performances, which wasdrawn up
forthepresent writer by’CheHussein ofPenang, the
actor ofwhom mention hasalready beenmade,maybe
ofinterest, andwillserve toindicate briefly their several
characteristic features, though itdoesnotprofess tobe
absolutely exhaustive:—

Suchcharms asmight beused intime ofwar, or
incaseofdanger from wild beasts orother enemies,
arepartly whatmaybecalled “defensive”andpartly
“offensive”incharacter.
TheMalays whousethem pray, ontheonehand,
forasupernatural appearance wherewith toscare their
enemies andprotect themselves, andontheother for
supernatural powers toassist inthedestruction oftheir
foes.
Thus, oneoftheircharms runs:—
“LetmefacetheSeven Suns,
But letnotmyenemies faceme.
Ha !IamaTiger andthou artaDog.”1
Theuseofsuchcharms issupplemented invarious
ways :thusachampion(penglima)willsometimes draw
aline infront ofhim,which hebelieves hisenemy will
beunable topass;2this isdonebysimply scraping the
ground with theright footandthreatening thefoe
with adirecurse ifheattempts tocross it.
“Pushandyou die,stepacross andyour legshall break.
Iapply thecharm oftheLine called theSwollen Corpse.”
According toanother method ofgaining martial
vigour andimmunity infighting, youtake awick as
long astheshort span between yourthumb and first
finger(sa-jengkal telunjok),and after passing itover
yourbodyupwards(di-naikkan)thrice, take itbetween
yourtwohands and tryandturn itround while you
repeat thecharm. Theceremony must take place at

ifyousucceed you will(according totheMalay account)
seethevision ofaman, asign, itistobesupposed,
thatthecharm hasbeen effectual, and thattheprayer
hasbeen heard.
Thecharm begins asfollows:—
“Inthename ofGod, themerciful, thecompassionate !
May thisnerve ofstone pierce stone,
Pierce stone and split stone,
Pierce planks andgoright through them,
Pierce water anddry itup,
Pierce theearthandmake ahole init,
Pierce thegrassandwither it,
Pierce mountains andcause them tofall,
Pierce theheavens thattheymay fall,” etc.
Thecharm concludes with thefollowing magnificent
boast:—
“OfIronam I,andofCopper ismyframe,
Andmyname is‘Tiger ofGod.’”
Inasomewhat similar charm, awarrior prays that
hemaybe
“Fenced with Hell-fire uptotheeyes;”
andanother expresses thewish that hisenemies may
be
“Ground topowder liketin-ore after washing.”
Inactual warfare anumber ofrules arelaiddown,
theobservance ofwhich issupposed tobenecessary in
order toachieve success. As inseveral other pur-
suits,1there is,ofcourse, a“taboo”language ofwar
(bhasa pantang pWang),ofwhich thefollowing are
examples:—

Dagger (k’ris)=pisau (lit.knife).

Stockade(kubu)=batang melintang (lit.transverse trunk), orbalei

When aman isout inthewars hispillows and
sleeping-mat athome have tobekept rolled up. If
anyone elsewere tousethem theabsent warrior’s
courage would fail,and disaster would befall him (ter-

have their haircut (tabulehpotong rambut atau beran-

chastity mustbeobserved inastockade, orthebullets
ofthegarrison will lose theirpower(peluru jinak di
kubu-nya),and itisalsoforbidden toabuse ormock
attheenemy, oreven attheirweapons .1
Bullets arefrequently, ifnotalways, “charmed”
before being used, andtheir efficacy issupposed tobe
increased thereby. TheOrang Kaya Pahlawan, a
chief ofsome local notoriety inrecent times, claimed to
beinvulnerable(kebal)
totheextent thatnothing but
asilver bullet would hurthim.
Thefollowing legendary tale illustrates asomewhat
similar idea:—The assailant, oneMagat Terawis, an
unknown warrior whohadjoined theSultan’s investing
army, hadfour bullets, oneach ofwhich were inscribed
thewords :“This isthesonoftheconcubine ofthe
Raja ofPagar-ruyong;hisname isMagat Terawis;
wherever hisbullet fallshewillbecome aChief.”

isattached, aswillappear from thefollowing passage
extracted from Newbold’s British Settlements inthe
Straits ofMalacca :—
“Translation ofMalayan MS. onKrises andProcess of
Damasking
“Fasl I.—OnthePamur, orDamasking ofKrises
“Ifthedamasking ofakrisonly reach within a
finger’s breadth ofthepoint, and ifitreach theedge,
itisinauspicious forcombat. Should thedamask not
beeven with thepoint, astabmade with such akris
would err;but ifeven, thenthekris willnever deviate,
although itspossessor losestrength tothrust;still,by
thegrace ofGod, itwillhitthemark should hecast it
athisadversary. Ifitbedamasked onboth sides, it
isgood;butnotsoshould thedamask beseparated at
intervals.
“Ifthedamask onthepoint bethat ofAlif besar

towear such aweapon while trading, norone inwhich
thedamask runs from thepangkal (thestem which

“How todamask krises.—Place ontheblade a
mixture ofboiled rice, sulphur, and saltbeat together,

remained onseven days, thedamask willhave risen to

“Fasl IV.—Measurement ofKrises
“Measure thekriswith astring below itsaring (a
jutting outoftheblade near itsbottom) toitspoint;

blade ofthekris,thenmake amarkhow farthestring
reaches. Measure theblade across atthismark, and
findhowmany times itsbreadth iscontained intwo-
thirds ofitslength;cutthestring intoasmany pieces.
These form the sloca, ormeasure, ofwhich thekris
consists. Ifnone ofthestring remain over, theblade is
perfect, ifaminute portion remain, itislessperfect, but if
halfthebreadth remain, ormore, itischelaka,unlucky.”
Newbold adds:—
“The krises most preferred arethose ofthekinds
termed Simpana, Cherita, and Sapokal. The kris
panjang isworn generally bytheMalayan aristocracy
andbridegrooms. Ihave seensome beautiful speci-
mens ofthisweapon inRumbowe, worn bythechiefs
ofthat state. The blades resembled that ofalong,
keen poniard ofDamascus steel;thehandles of
ebony, covered with flowered gold, andsheaths richly
ornamented with thesame metal;theyareused inthe
execution ofcriminals. Malays donotprize their
krises entirely bythequantity ofgoldwithwhich they
maybeinlaid, butmore fortheir accurate proportions
agreeably tothemeasurement which islaiddown in
their treatises onthissubject; thedamask ontheblade;
theantiquity andacertain lucky quality thattheymay
possess either from accurate proportions, thedamask,
thehaving shedhuman blood, orfrom supernatural
endowment, likethefamous sword “Excalibur.” This
property istermed betuah,which signifies literally
exempt from accident, invulnerable. The reverse is
termed chelaka,ill-omened. They believe the
betuah insome cases imparts invulnerability tothe
possessor ofsuch akris,which ishanded down asan
heirloom from father toson,andhonoured assome-
thing divine. The kris is,aswith theJavanese, an

indispensable article indress onparticular occasions,
and there arenumerous regulations regarding the
wearing of it.TheUndang Undang Malacca1con-
tains strict injunctions, which areobserved tothisday,
against aperson ofinferior birth wearing akrisorna-
mented withgold.”2
Besides themode above described, several other
methods ofmeasuring thekris arealso invogue.
They differ invarious matters ofdetail, and willbe
found intheAppendix.
Themeasurement ofone-edged weapons iseffected
asfollows:—
Measure thelength oftheweapon from hiltto
point, andfoldthestring someasured intwo. Measure
offthis half-length from the hiltandseehow often
thebreadth oftheblade iscontained inthewhole
length ofthe string. Each time, however, that the
edge isreached, thestring must bemarked ordented,
andthelongendwrapped round andround theblade,
sothatthemeasurement ofeachbreadth isconsecutive to
thepreceding breadth, theportion ofthestring which is
stretched across theback oftheblade notbeing counted.
Thismethod iscalled ukormata sa-Ulah,and is
usedbySumatran Malays, especially inMenangkabau.
Spearheads canalsobemeasured:—
1TheCode ofSultanMahmud Shah,
the lastMalay Raja ofMalacca, who
wasexpelled bythePortuguese under
Alboquerque inA.D. IS11 *
ThisCode wasprobably founded on
earlier regulations ascribed toSultan
Muhammad Shah, the firstMuhamma-
danRaja ofMalacca, andSultan Mud-
hafar Shah, hisson. Nothing isknown
about thelaws ofthe lastnamed, ex-
cept that (according totheSejarah
Malayu,chap, xii.),“he ordered the
Book ofInstitutes, orKitab Undang-Undang,tobecompiled,” butthepre-
ceding chapter ofthesame work has
agood deal tosayabout thelaws of
SultanMuhammad Shah, andmentions
thathe“prohibited theornamenting
ofcreeses with gold, etc.”SeeLeyden,
op.cit.,pp.94,118.
Asimilar prohibition occurs insec-
tion i.ofSultan Mahmud’s Code, of
which atranslation willbefound in
Newbold, Malacca, vol. ii.pp.231 seq.

Measure offthelength ofthespearhead andfold
thestring intwo;seehow often thebreadth iscon-
tained inthehalfofthestring;iftheblade isagood
one, itmust befiveandahalftimes(tengah anam).
This iscalled ukororang Perak orukor tengah anam.
Another superstition connected withweapons is
described asfollows bySirFrank Swettenham. It
illustrates themagic powers attributed tothePawang
insomany departments ofnature and life,butdoes
notseem tohaveanyspecial object ormeaning.
“Agreatmany Malays andoneortwoEuropeans
maybefoundwho profess tohave seenwater drawn
from akris. Themodus operandi issimple. The
pawang (Idarenot callhimconjurer) works withbare
arms toshow there isnodeception. Hetakes the
kris (yours, ifyouprefer it)from itswooden handle,
and, holding the steel point downwards inhis left
hand, herecites ashort incantation totheeffect that
heknows allabout iron,andwhere itcomes from, and
that itmustobey hisorders. Hethenwiththethumb
and firsttwo fingers ofhisright hand proceeds to
gently squeeze the steel, moving hisfingers upand
down theblade. After alittle while afewdrops of
water fallfrom thepoint ofthekris,andthese drops
quickly develop intoastream that will fillacup.The
pawang willthenhand round theblade and tellyouto
bend it;thisyou willfindnodifficulty indoing, butby
making twoorthree passes over thekristhepawang
canrender itagain sohard that itcannot bebent.
“Theonlydrawback tothistrick ormiracle isthat
theprocess ruins thetemper ofthe steel, andakris
thathasbeen thus treated isuseless.”1

oftheothers, has lost itsformer importance, andbe-
come almost amatter ofmerely historical interest. In
theMalay Peninsula, atleast intheStates which are
under British protection, offensive weapons areseldom
worn now-a-days except onState occasions and for
purely ceremonial purposes;and warfare, itmaybe
hoped, isnowathing ofthepast. Inspite ofthehalo
ofromance thrown round itinnative writings, Malay
warfare (inmodern times, atleast) hasnever been
anything butthebarest andmost bloodthirsty piracy
bysea,andthemerest “bushwhacking” andstockade-
fighting onland;itsfinal suppression, even ifinsome
degree itshould involve aslackening offibre inthe
Malay character, isnotamatter forregret. With it
willdisappear much ofthecurious lorethatsurrounded
it,andindeed agood deal of itmust havebeen lost
already. Little hasbeen saidhere ofthemethods of
divination used inwarfare which takeupsomuch
space inMalay treatises onthesubject;success in
war isheld todepend onagreat number ofminute
observances, and tobecapable ofbeing foretold by
careful attention toomens andsigns. Butthedivina-
tionapplied inwarfare does notseem todiffer inprin-
ciplefrom thatwhich isused inalltheother avocations
oflife,andasufficient ideaofitsnature willbegathered
from theaccount given inthenext section.

fulljustice within thenarrow limits ofthisbook.My
object willbemerely toindicate themain lines on
which these twoimportant doctrines oftheMalay
natural religion appear tohavebeen developed.
Briefly, then,omens maybedrawn either from the
actsofmen ortheevents ofnature. Examples ofthe
ominous import attributed totheactsofman willat
once suggest themselves. Thus sneezing issaid tobe
fortunate astending todrive away thedemons of
disease;1yawning isabad sign, forobvious reasons,
ifthebreath isloudly emitted, but ifaquietyawn
occurs when thestomach iscraving forfood, itimports
that itwillsoonbefilled. Sotoostumbling isabad

tosetoutonajourney .2Then, again, “tobelong in

means thattheperson, ifunmarried, willmeet witha
badreception from hisorherparents-in-law hereafter.

misfortune, andaregenerally given away incharity.

Achild seen doing this isinstantly rebuked and

“The evileye isdreaded byMalays. Notonly
areparticular people supposed tobepossessed ofa
quality which causes ill-luck toaccompany their glance
(themal ’occhio ofthe Italians), buttheinfluence of
theevileye isoften supposed toaffect children, who
aretaken notice ofbypeople kindly disposed towards
them. For instance, itisunlucky toremark onthe
fatness and healthiness ofababy, andaMalay will
employ some purely nonsensical word, orconvey his
meaning inaroundabout form, rather than incur
possible misfortune byusing theactual word‘fat.’

andasnake, areperhaps themost dreaded ofthese
unnatural visitors. They aresprinkled with ashes, if
possible, tocounteract their evilinfluence.
“Aswarm ofbees settling near ahouse isanun-
lucky omen, andprognosticates misfortune.”1
So,too,omens aretaken either from the flight or
cries ofcertain birds, such asthenight-owl, thecrow,
some kinds ofwild doves, and thebird called the
“Rice’s Husband” (lakipadi).
Passing from theideaofmereomens drawn from
fortuitous events weeasily arrive attheidea ofacon-
scious attempt onthepartoftheworshipper toascertain
thedivine pleasure with respect toasacrifice newly
offered. This effort oftheworshippers becomes
crystallised intime intoasub-rite, which yetforms
anintegral portion ofmost, ifnot all,ofthemore im-
portant ceremonies,2and eventually develops into a
special andseparate rite called Tilek (divination), of
which examples willnowbegiven.
Oneform ofthis ritewastaught byaMalay of
Penang extraction, whose instructions, takendown by
meatthetime, ranasfollows:—
Take alemon (liman purut),ahen’s egg, ataper

birches, oneofwhich mustbecomposed ofseven, and
theother oftwelve, leaf-ribs ofthe“green”cocoa-nut

Two ofthebananas, two cigarettes, twochews of
“betel,” halfofeach ofthethree kinds ofrice,the
egg,andthebirch ofseven twigs, mustnowbetaken
outside thehouse and setdown under atreeselected
forthepurpose. When setting itdown theeggmust
becracked, thecigarettes lighted, and finally thetaper
also. Ononeoccasion when Iwitnessed theper-
formance, thetaper, afterbeing taken upbetween the
outstretched fingers ofmyfriends twohands, was
waved slowly toand fro—first totherightandthen to
the left;finally itwas setdown ontheground and
began toburn blue, theflame becoming more and
moredim until italmost expired. Onseeing thisthe
medicine-man exclaimed, “He haspromised” (dia
mengaku),and ledthewayback tothehouse, where
heproceeded togothrough theremainder ofthe
ceremony.
First, hedeposited thebrazier with incense upon
theleafofabanana-tree, thentook theprickle ofthe
fishandthrust ithorizontally through thelower endof
thelemon, leaving bothendsexposed;thenhethrust
theneedle through inatransverse direction, soasto
form across, theends oftheneedle being likewise ex-
posed, andslipped thenoosed endofapiece ofsilken
thread ofseven different colours over thepoints thus
exposed.


VI TILEK 537
Next hescattered the riceround thecenser and
fumigated thebirch andthelemon, recited acharm
asheheld the latter inhisright hand, recited the
charm forthesecond time1ashetook thebirch in
both hands, with theupper end close tohismouth
andthelower (spreading) endover thebrazier, and
finally repeated thecharm forathird time, suspending,
ashedid so,thelemon over thebrazier bymeans of
thethread held inhislefthand andholding thebirch
intheright.
Everything being ready, henowbegan toput
questions tothelemon intowhich the spiritwassup-
posed tohave entered, rebuking itandthreatening it
with thebirchwhenever itfailed toanswer distinctly
and tothe point. The conversational powers of
this spirit were extremely limited, being confined
totwo signs signifying “Yes” and“No.” The
affirmative was indicated byapendulum -like
swaying ofthelemon, which rocked toand frowith
more orlessvehemence according totheemphasis
(asmyfriend informed me)withwhich thereplywas
tobedelivered. Negation, ontheother hand, was
indicated byacomplete cessation ofmotion onthe
partofthelemon.
When itisrequired todiscover, forinstance, the
name ofathief, thenames ofallthosewho areatall
likely tohave committed the theft arewritten on
scraps ofpaper andarranged inacircle round the
brazier, when thelemon will atonce swing inthe
direction ofthename oftheguilty party. Thebest
night fortheperformance ofthisceremony isaTuesday.

SirFrank Swettenham saccount ofasimilar cere-
mony ofwhich hewasaneye-witness willserve asa
good illustration ofthemethods inuseforthispur-
pose:—
“Itwasmymisfortune some years ago tobe
robbed ofsome valuable property, andseveral Malay
friends strongly advised metotake theadvice ofan
astrologer, orother learned person who (sothey said)
would beable togive thename ofthethief, andprob-
ablyrecover most ofthestolen things. Ifearthat I
hadnogreat faith inthismethod ofdetection, but I
wasanxious toseewhat could bedone, fortheEast is
acurious place, andnoonewithaninquiring mind can
have lived initlongwithout seeing phenomena that
arenotalways explained bymodern text-books on
Natural Philosophy.
“Iwas firstintroduced toanArab ofveryremark-
able appearance. Hewasabout fiftyyears old, tall,
with pleasant features and extraordinary gray-blue
eyes, clearand far-seeing, aman ofstriking andim-
pressive personality. Iwas travelling when Imet
him,and tried topersuade him toreturn withme,but
thathesaidhecould notdo,though hepromised to
followmebyanearly steamer. Hesaidhewould be
able totellme allabout therobbery, whocommitted
it,where thestolen property then was,andthat allhe
would want wasanempty house wherein hemight
fast insolitude forthree days, without which prepara-
tion,hesaid, hewould notbeable toseewhat he
sought. Hetoldmethat after his vigil, fast,and
prayer, hewould layinhishand asmall piece ofpaper
onwhich there would besome writing;into thishe
would pour alittle water, and inthatextemporised
mirror hewould seeavision ofthewhole transaction.

Hedeclared that, aftergazing intently into thisdivin-
ing-glass, theinquirer firstrecognised thefigure ofa
little oldman. That having duly saluted thisJin ,it
wasnecessary toaskhim toconjure upthescene of
therobbery, when allthedetails would bere-enacted
intheliquid glass under theeyes ofthegazer, who
would thereandthen describe allthathesaw. Ihad
heard allthis before, only ithadbeen stated tome
then thatthemedium through whose eyes thevision
could alone beseenmust beayoung child ofsuch
tender years that itcould have never told alie!
TheArab, however, professed himself notonly able to
conjure upthescene, buttoletmesee itformyself if
Iwould follow hisdirections. Unfortunately, my
gray-eyed friend failed tokeep hispromise, and I
never methimagain.
“A local Chief, however, declared hispower to
read thepastbythismethod, ifonlyhecould findthe
truthful child. Inthisheappeared tosucceed, but
when, onthefollowing day,hecame todisclose tome
theresults ofhis skill, hesaid that adifficulty had
arisen, because justwhen thechild (alittle boy)was
beginning torelate what hesawhesuddenly became
unconscious, and ittook theastrologer twohours to
restore him tohisnormal state. Allthemothers of
tender-aged andpossibly truthful children declined after
this tolend their offspring fortheordeal.

either another title ofShiva, orstands forKali, his

but itmaybedoubted whether thisdivision oftime
isnotofJavanese orMalayan origin, although the
importance ofthenumber Jive isalsorecognised bythe
Hindus .2
Thesame mystic notions ofcolour and the like
areattached tothese divisions bytheMalays as

thus Maheswara’s colour isyellow -white (fiutek

Similarly S’ri’s colour iswhite, Brahma’s isred,
Vishnu’s isgreen, andeach division has itsrespective
advantages ordisadvantages .1
Another version ofthissystem, known astheFive

itsdivisions, viz.Ahmad, Jibra’il (Gabriel), Ibrahim
(Abraham), Yusuf (Joseph), and ‘Azra’il (Azrael).

For thesecond daytheseries begins with the
Moon, andgoesonintheabove order toMercury;
and forthethird day itbegins withMars;sothat
each day oftheweek begins with itsappropriate
planet intheusual order, which isbestseen inthe
French names Mardi, Mercredi, Jeudi, Vendredi, and
theEnglish Saturday, Sunday andMonday.
Each oftheseven divisions has itslucky orunlucky
characteristics, much asinthesystems already de-
scribed.
Besides these, eachdayoftheweek has itsown
appropriate occupations, according toanother system,
attimes ascertained bymeasuring thelength ofone’s
shadow. Further, itwould appear thatsome days
areunlucky altogether :oneaccount gives seven un-
lucky days inevery month;another asserts thatThurs-
day isunlucky inthemonths Dhu-’l-hijjah, Muharram,
andSafar;Tuesday inRabi‘-al-awal, Rabi‘-al-akhir,
andJumada-’l-awal;Saturday inJumada-’l-akhir,
Rejab andSha'ban;Sunday inRamadhan, Shawal,
and Dhu-’l-ka‘idah;athird specifies twelve other
most inauspicious days inevery year, viz.the28th of
Muharram, the10thofSafar, the14thofRabi‘-al-awal,

Most ofthese systems ofdivination involve the
construction ofasortofcalendar, andrequire some
degree ofastronomical knowledge;butofastronomy
properly so-called theMalays have scarcely even a
smattering, itsplace being taken bythe, tothem,
farmore important science ofastrology. “Their
meagre ideas regarding themotions oftheheavenly
bodies are derived, through theArabs, from the
Ptolemaic system.”2
The seven Heavenly Bodies (Bintang Tujok),
mentioned above, whose motions they believe tobe
produced bytheagency ofangels,3retain theirArabic
names,4andarebelieved torulethe“seven ominous
moments ”(Katika Tujoh),which aresupposed to
depend ontheinfluences ofthese several sidereal
bodies.5
Thesigns oftheZodiac similarly bear Arabic ap-
pellations, theform ofdivination inwhich they bear
theprincipal partbeing called theTwelve Constella-
tions (Bintang Dua-b' las).6
This form ofdivination isnotquite socommon
asarethose oftheFiveOminous Times (5-square) and
theSeven Heavenly Bodies (7-square), and Ihave
notbeen able tofindoutmuch about themethods of
working it,butacopy ofoneofthediagrams used

VI BINTANG DUA-B'LAS 55i
According toone view, which isperhaps the
prevalent one,every man’s luck isdetermined byone
orother ofthezodiacal constellations, and inorder
tofindoutwhich one itis,thefollowing direction is
given:—
“Reckon thenumerical equivalent oftheperson’s
name andofthename ofhismother bythevalues of
theletters according tothesystem oftheAbjad;add
thetwonumerical equivalents together, and divide
thetotalbytwelve; iftheremainder is1,hissign is
theRam, if2,theBull,andsoon.”
Each constellation hasaseries ofcharacteristics
which aresupposed toinfluence thewhole lifeofthe
person who issubject toit.1
Besides theabove, afewoftheother constellations
areknown topossess Malay names, andwherever this
isthe case, thename given appears usually tobe
quite original, having noconnection with thenomen-
clature obtaining among nations withwhich weare
more familiar .2
Inaddition totheabove, theMalays possess a
curious system bywhich thelunarmonth isdivided
intoanumber ofparts called Rejang .According to
Newbold, “thetwenty-eight Rejangs resemble theNac-
shatras orlunar mansions oftheHindoos, rather than

;1and itisapriori veryprob-
able thattheyowe their origin tothisHindu system.
ButbytheMalays their application hasbeen generally
misunderstood, and theirnumber isusually raised to
thirty soastofitthedays ofthelunar month. Each
ofthese divisions has itssymbol, which isusually an
animal, andthe firstanimal inthe list is(inalmost all
versions) thehorse.Ahorses head isalsothefigure

tobelittle trace ofidentity intheremaining figures,

Malays have embodied thissystem inaseries of
mnemonic verses (known asSka‘ir Rejang),ofwhich
there areseveral versions, eg.theRejang of’Che
Busu, theRejang Sindiran Maiat,andothers .2
TheRejangs arealsodealt with atlength inprose

with thedays ofthelunar month, begins “on the

istomake arepresentation ofahorseandthrow it
away towards the(East?)”1Inother respects this
system ofdivination seems toagree initsmain
features with those which have already been
described.
Having mentioned thedivisions ofthecalendar
which arechiefly used indivination, itseems desirable,
forthesake ofcompleteness, toallude briefly tothose
thatremain.
“The better informed Malays acknowledge the
solar year of365 days, which they term thetoun
(tahun) shemsiah,but inobedience totheirMoham-
medan instructors, adopt thelunar year(tounkum-
riah)of354days.”2
Thisremark isstilltrue,nodoubt, oftheup-country
Malays ontheWest Coast, but inmost districts,
and toanextent commensurate with European
influence, thesolar year isnowbeing gradually intro-
duced.
Thesame remark applies tothemethod ofreckon-
ingmonths, adualsystem being now invogue in
many places where there ismost contact withEuro-
peans. Regarding thenative methods thefollowing
quotation istothepoint:—
“There arethree ways ofreckoning themonths.

month, andtwenty-nine tothesecond month, andso
onalternately totheendoftheyear.
“Second, thePersian mode, viz.thirty days toeach
month;and, thirdly, that ofRum, i.e .thirty-one days
tothemonth. The first isingeneral use.Some few,
withgreater accuracy, calculate their year at354days
eight hours, intercalating every three years twenty-four
hours, oronedaytomake upthedeficiency, andthirty-
three days forthedifference between thesolar and
lunar years.
“Butthemajority ofthelower classes estimate their
yearbythe fruit seasons andbytheir crops ofrice
only. Many, however, obstinately adhere tothelunar
months, andplant theirpaddy attheannual return of
thelunar month.”
“TheMalay months havebeen divided intoweeks
ofseven days,marked bythereturn oftheMoham-
medan Sabbath. Natives whohave hadintercourse
withEuropeans divide thedayandnight intotwenty-
four parts, butthemajority measure thedaybythe
sun’s apparent progress through theheavens, thecrow
ofthecock, etc.The religious daycommences at
sunset, likethatoftheArabs andHebrews.”
“There aretwo cycles borrowed from theArabs,
andknown only toafew, viz.one of120 years,
th.edour1besar, andtheother ofeight, dour kechil.
The latter issometimes seen indates ofletters, and
resembles themode adopted byusofdistinguishing by
letters thedifferent days oftheweek, substituting eight
years fortheseven days. Theorder oftheletters is

VI MAGIC SQUARES 555
IfindtheSiamese mode ofdesignating thedifferent
years ofthecycle bythenames ofanimals adopted.”1
Most ifnot allthese systems ofreckoning seem to
havebeen treated bytheMalays from theastrological
point ofview asforming abasis fordivination, and
these crude notions ofthelucky orunlucky nature of
certain times andseasons aretosome extent systemat-
isedbyorinsome degree mixed upwith theideaof
themystic influence ofnumbers and geometrical
figures.
Ofthemystic figures used indivination, the first in
importance is,nodoubt, what hasbeen called the
“magic square,” aterm applied to“asetofnumbers

The ordinary Malay astrologer most likely under-
stands very little ofthepeculiar properties ofamagic
square, andconsequently henotunfrequently makes
mistakes inthearrangement ofthefigures. Ibelieve,
also, that inusing thesquares forpurposes ofdivination
henowusually begins atonecorner andcounts straight
on,thebeginning place being almost always distin-

Sometimes, again, thenames ofthe fiveHindu
deities already mentioned willbefound similarly
arranged, inwhich case theyappear torefer tothe
divisions oftheday,described above under thename
ofKatika Lima. Besides thisclass ofmagic squares,
however, there areother kinds which present irregu-
larities, andarenotsoeasily explainable. Some of
these violate thefundamental rule ofthemagic
square, which insists thateach square shallhave an
equalnumber ofsmall squares running eachway,and
that thisnumber shallbeanoddone.
Others exhibit therightnumber ofsmall squares
(3x3or5x5or7x7), butinstead ofasubdivision
intosub-groups, have merely anarrangement ofalter-
native emblems, such asabudandafull-blown flower,
orthelike.
Ananalysis ofthesquares whose figures aregiven

compasses.” Ofthese thecommonest form isadraw-
ing, inwhich theplaces usually occupied bythepoints
ofthecompass areoccupied bythenames ofcertain
things (usually animals orbirds) which aresupposed
tobenaturally opposed toeach other. Thus inone
ofthese compass-like figures wefind (vide PI.25,
Fig. 2)
TheBird \sic\(N.) opposed totheFowl (S.)
TheCrocodile (N.E.) „ „„Fish (S.W.)
TheRat(E.) „ „„Cat(W.)

TheCrocodile (N.E.) „ „„Fish (S.W.)
TheRat(E.) „ „„Cat(W.)

TheCrocodile (E.),, ,, ,,Fish(W.)

whilst afourth hasalternately capeandbay.
Theway inwhich these figures were used fordivi-
nation isvery clearly shown byPL25,Fig. 1,which is
copied from afigure inoneofmy(Selangor) charm-
books, which hadthedays ofthemonth, from the 1st
tothe30th, written round itinblue ink. Starting
from thenorth aspect, youcount round totheleftuntil
(allowing oneday toeach aspect) you arrive atthe
aspect corresponding tothenumber ofthedayofthe
month upon which youwish tostart your journey.

stronger influences, andyou willbeallright. Ifthe
firstaspect-compass which youconsult isnotaccom-
modating enough foryour requirements, gooncon-
sulting others untilyoufindonewhich issatisfactory.
Other forms ofthecompass-figure areused for
divining whether ifhestarts onacertain daytheman
willgetthebetter ofhisenemy, ormeet withaperson
(eg. aslave orathief) whohasrunaway. Inthe
former case adouble circle ofhuman figures isused,
thefigures oftheinner circle representing theperson
who seeks theinformation, andthose oftheouter
circle hisenemy. Thecounting iscarried outinpre-
cisely thesame manner asbefore, andtheheadless
figure ineach case represents themanwho will lose.
Inthecaseofadrawn battle neither party, ofcourse,
loses hishead.
Inthecase ofanabsconder, asingle circle of
figures isused, thefigures pointing towards thecentre
signifying thattheabsconding party willreturn orbe
caught, andthose pointing away from thecentre signi-
fying theopposite. Inonecase (PI. 25,Fig. 2)there
arefourteen human figures arranged intwoopposing
rows ofseven, every alternate figure being headless.
Inthiscaseyou start thecounting attheright-hand
figure ofthebottom row,andcount towards the left.
Yetanother form ofdivination inwhich thehuman
figure ismade use of,isshown inPI.25,Fig. r;a

Figures ofdragons(naga)andscorpions(kala)are
sometimes used inasimilar manner;andthere isalso
anaspect-compass known asthe Rctjal-cil-ghaib or
Jinazah Sayidna ‘Ali ibnAbu Talib (thebody or
bierofOurLord ‘Ali, thesonofAbu Talib), which,
according tothis notion, “iscontinually being carried
byangels1towards the different quarters ofthe
heavens, andmust notbefaced;for ifone faces to-

The aspect tobeavoided varies from day today,
turning towards eachoftheeight points oftheordinary
Malay compass three orfourtimes inthelunar month.
Thesubject ofomens ingeneral hasbeen shortly
dealt with atthebeginning ofthis section, and also
incidentally mentioned inconnection with various
departments ofnature andhuman life. Itwould
hardly bepossible tomake acomplete orsystematic
listofthethings fromwhich omens aretaken. Apart
from those depending merely onTimes, Seasons,
Numbers, andAspect, which have been already dealt
with atquite sufficient length, itmaybenoted that
omens aredrawn from earthquakes, thunder, “house-
lizards, rats,andother four-footed things,” according
tothetimes atwhich they areobserved, from the
colour, smell, andnature ofsoil(inchoosing building-
sites), from birds, and, infact,from avery large variety
ofmatters which cannot beclassified under anygeneral
head. The lines ofthehand are,ofcourse, interpreted

evilfortune. Ithasnotbeen possible tocollect much
information onthesubject ofMalay chiromancy, but
forthebenefit ofEuropean adepts in‘‘palmistry” (as
itseems tobeusually styled nowadays) itmay be
worth while mentioning that theMalays attach im-

More important, perhaps, aretheomens believed
tobederived from dreams, ofwhich there seem to

thing beginning withTisvery lucky indeed, todream
ofathing beginning withHmeans thatavisitor from
adistance istobeexpected;Nindicates sorrow, Lis
ahint togive alms tothepoor andneedy, andso
forth. According toanother system, apurely arbitrary
meaning isputupon thesubject-matter ofthedream,

terpretation. Thus todream ofagaleofwind inthe

Asaspecimen oftheimportance traditionally
ascribed todreams, itseems worth while togive the
following popular legend, which also illustrates the
type offolk-tales inwhich hidden treasure plays a
great part:—
“Che Puteh Jambai and hiswifewere verypoor

multitude ofrival claims sobewildered theunhappy

never since been seen. Their property wasnever

andwent toseek for itinthedistant lands ofKacha-

Charms,Talismans,andWitchcraft
While bydivination andbyinferences fromomens
anddreams, Malays attempt toascertain thecourse
offate, sobycharms ofthenature ofamulets and
talismans theysometimes endeavour toinfluence its
direction ormodify itsforce. Charms ofthenature
ofinvocations have been dealt with already under
different headings inconnection with avariety of
matters, and itwillonlybenecessary torefer here toa
fewmiscellaneous ones ofalesselaborate character.
Itshould beobserved thatsome charms aredirectly
effective orprotective, likeamulets ortalismans,
while others aresupposed towork onlybyinfluen-
cing thevolition ofanother mind. Under the latter
head come thegreat mass oflove-charms, charms
forsecuring conjugal fidelity, orforcompelling the

VI TALISMANS 567
revelation byanother person ofhisorher secret
thoughts, and the like, ofwhich Malay books of
magic are full;while under theformer come sundry
recipes ofamore orlessmedicinal nature forthepur-
pose ofcuring various diseases, ofincreasing physical
power orvirility, orofprotecting theperson against
evil influences, natural orsupernatural. Inmost of
these cases themodus operandi isofthesimplest char-
acter;thecharm consists usually ofashort Arabic
prayer orafew letters and figures, sometimes quite
meaningless andconventional, sometimes making up
oneormore ofthesacred names (Allah, Muhammad,
‘Ali, etc.). These charms arewritten onpaper orcloth
andworn ontheperson;sometimes they arewritten
onthebody itself, especially onthepart tobeaffected;
occasionally they arewritten onacupwhich isthen
used fordrinking purposes. Such prescriptions are
infinite innumber, andaretobefound inMalay charm-
books, wedged inamongst matter ofamore strictly
medical kind;infact, itwould bequite correct tosay
that letter-charms [rajah, \azimat)andsacred names
have their place intheMalay Pharmacopoeia sideby
sidewith spices, herbs, roots, andthe like. Butsuch
charms arealsoused formany other purposes :“to
ward offdemons [sheitan), tomake children feed at
thebreast properly, toprevent them from crying and
fromgoing intoconvulsions, toprevent therice-crops
from being devoured bypigs, rats,andmaggots,”
areconsecutive instances ofthecharms contained in
apage ofoneofthenumerous Malay treatises on
these matters. Itwould, from thenature ofthecase,
beutterly impossible toexhaust thisendless subject,
and itisnotnecessary todwell upon itatgreater
length, asthedetails ofthecharms used (ofwhich a


568 DIVINATION ANDTHEBLACK ART CHAP.
fewarequoted intheAppendix) donotasarule offer
anyfeatures ofgeneral interest .1
Farmore interesting isthatform oftheBlack Art
which attempts to“abduct,” orinsomeway“get at”
another person’s soul,whether (asinthecase ofthe
ordinary love-charm), inorder toinfluence itinthe
operator’s favour, or,ontheother hand, with aview to
doing thevictim some harm, which maytake theform
ofmadness, disease, oreven death.
These results canbearrived atbyavariety of
methods :insome ofthem theinfluence works entirely
without contact, inothers there issome sortofcontact
between thevictim andthereceptacle intowhich his
soul istobeenticed. Afewspecimens ofthemethods
employed willconclude thispart ofthesubject;they
arenecessarily somewhat ofamiscellaneous character,
but itwillbeseen thatthey arereally only different
applications ofthesame general principle, thenature
ofwhich hasalready been indicated inthesection on
theSoul .2
The following isaninstance ofdirect contact
between thesoulreceptacle and itsowner’s body—
“Take soilfrom thecentre ofthefootprint(hati-
hati tapak) oftheperson youwish tocharm, and
‘treat itceremonially’
(di-puja)forabout three days.
“The‘ceremonial treatment’consists inwrapping
itupinpieces ofred, black, andyellow cloth3(the

Itmaybesafely estimated that the
sexual relations arehere ofthe first

indirectly.

here given areclosely akin tothose of
medicine (v.pp.452-456, supra)', buttheends aredifferent. The medical man

yellow being outside), andhanging itfrom thecentre
ofyour mosquito-curtain with parti-coloured thread
(penggantong-nya benang panchar ond). Itwillthen
become (the domicile of)your victim’s soul {jadi
semangat). Youmust, however, tocomplete thecere-
mony, switch itwith abirch ofseven leaf-ribs taken
from a ‘green’cocoa-nut(penyembat-nya lidiniyor
hijau tujoh Vet)seven times atsundown, seven times
atmidnight, andseven times atsunrise, continuing
thisforthree days, andsaying asyoudoso:—
“*Itisnotearth that Iswitch,
Buttheheart ofSo-and-so
(Bukan-nya akumenyembat tanah
,
Akumenyembat hati SiAnu).
“Then bury itinthemiddle ofapathwhere your
victim issure tostepover it(supaya buleh di-langkah-
nya), andhewillcertainly become distraught. The
onlytaboo inconnection with itisthatyoushould let
nooneshare your sleeping -mat.” The soul-recep-
tacle inthiscase isthelump ofearth taken from the
centre ofthevictim’s footprint. Itissaid toactually
“become (the victim’s) soul,” butnodoubt this is
merely figurative, though itcompletely proves the
identification ofthesoul with itsreceptacle inthe
Malay mind. The object ofthebirching isnotself-
evident, butmaybeintended todispel evilinfluences,
andsopurify itfortheincoming soul.
Another wayofobtaining therequired result isto
scrape offsome ofthewood ofthefloorfrom theplace
where your intended victim hasbeen sitting. Having
secured this, takesome of’the soilfrom hisorher
footprint andmixthem both together withwaxfrom
adeserted bees’ comb, moulding thefigure into his

orher likeness. Fumigate itwith incense, and
“beckon” tothesoulbywaving acloth (lambei
semangat) every night forthree nights successively,
reciting thischarm :—
“‘OM !’shout itagain andagain !
Stupid anddazed
Betheheart ofSomebody,
Thinking ofme.
Ifyoudonotthink ofme,
The forty-four angels shall curse you.”
Another method isasfollows:—
Take parings ofnails, hair,eyebrows, saliva, etc.of
your intended victim (sufficient torepresent every part
ofhisperson), andmake them upinto hislikeness
withwaxfrom adeserted bees’ comb. Scorch the
figure slowly byholding itover alamp every night for
seven nights, andsay:—
“Itisnotwaxthat Iamscorching,
Itisthe liver, heart, andspleen ofSo-and-so that Iscorch.”
After theseventh time burn the figure, andyour
victim will die.
The description ofthenext ceremony istaken
word forword from acharm-book which Iobtained
from aLangat Malay (named ’Che Indut), andwhich
isstill inmypossession. As itillustrates several new
points about thesewax figures, andassuchcharms are

There are,as Ihave said, several newpoints tobe
gotfrom thischarm. You mustmake theimage
resemble acorpse
;youmustmake itofthelength

nails, etc.)would have tobeworkedupwith thewax,andthatthey arenot
mentioned, because understood.

and, finally,
inorder toabsolve yourself from blood-guiltiness, you
shift theburden ofyourcrime ontotheshoulders of
theArchangel Gabriel !!!
There are,ofcourse, many slight variations ofthe
actual ceremony. Sometimes thewizard, during the
insertion ofthepins intotheimage, exclaims:—
“Itisnotwaxthat Islay2
Butthe liver, heart, andspleen ofSo-and-so.”
And then, after “waving”thefigure inthesmoke of
theincense, anddepositing itinthecentre ofasacri-
ficial tray(anchak),heinvites the spirits tobanquet
upon hisvictim’s body:—
“Idonotbanquet youupon anything else,3

When theceremony isover theimage isburied inthe
usualway infront ofthevictim’s door-step.
Another method isdescribed asfollows:—
“Make thewaxfigure intheusualwayandwith the

This isacharm forsowing dissension between
husband andwife(pembenchi):—
Make twoofthewax figures intheordinary way,
buttaking care thatoneresembles thehusband and
theother thewife. Sitdown withyour legsstretched
outbefore you,andhold thefigures face tofacewhile
yourepeat thecharm thrice, and attheendofeach
repetition breathe upon their heads. Then laythe
manupon theground onyour right sideclose toyour
thigh, butlooking away from it;andthewoman atthe
sideofthe leftthigh inasimilar position, sothatthey
both lookaway fromeach other. Then burn incense
and recite thesamecharm twenty-two times over the
manandtwenty-two times over thewoman. Now
putthem back toback, andwrap them upinseven
thicknesses oftheleaves oftnkas/and tiethem round
with thread ofseven colours wrapped seven times
round them, repeat thecharm andbury them. Dig
themupafterseven daysandsee iftheyare stillthere.
Ifyou findthem thecharm has failed, but ifnot, it
willwork, andthey willassuredly bedivorced. The
charm runs asfollows:—

Thefollowing isaclearexample ofsoulabduction
without contact:—
The simplest way, perhaps, ofabducting another
person’s soul istogoout,when thesun clears

newly-risen moon looks red,andstanding with the
bigtoeoftheright foot resting onthebigtoeof
the left, tomake atrumpet ofyour right hand and
recite theappropriate charm through thisimprovised
speaking-trumpet thrice. Attheendofeach recital
youblow through thehollowed fist. Thecharm
runs asfollows:—
“‘OM.’ Iloosemyshaft, Iloose itandthemoon clouds

Iloose it,andthesun isextinguished,
Iloose it,andthestarsburn dim.

Asecond method istobeatyourownshadow,1
ceremonially;according tothismethod youtake a
cane (ofrattan orrotan sega), inlength aslong asyour
body, fumigate itwith incense and recite acharm over
itseven times, striking yourownshadow with thecane
onceafter each recital. Repeat this atsundown, mid-
night, and early morning, andsleep under acoverlet
made offive cubits ofwhite cloth, andthesoulyou

thecharm, avery curious one:—
“Ho !Irupi, Shadowy One,

But ifshesleep,

And useyourutmost endeavours tobringthem tome.

Another method ofabducting another person’s soul
isasfollows:—
“Take alimebranch which hasseven limes on
asingle stalk, andsuspend itfrom thetopofyour

isthattheshadow issupposed insome
way toembody oratleast represent
thesoul. Thus thefemale reapers of
the firstripepadi arespecially enjoined

sothat theirshadow maynot fallupon

thespeaker’s shadow -soul isexpected
tofetch thewoman’s body-soul, andthe
beating oftheshadow-soul isperhaps
purely ceremonial, todrive away evilinfluences from it,before itstarts on
itsjourney, butthis latter suggestion is
merely conjectural. The first lineof
thecharm, however, inwhich the
speaker addresses hisshadow byname
(Irupi) ashestrikes itwith thecane,
points outmost clearly theconnection
between thebody-soul (orpuppet-soul)
andtheshadow-soul, towhich Ihave
referred. The coverlet orwhite cloth

Thefollowing ceremony isone inwhich thesoulof

follows:—

Then stand opposite thedoor, looking ifpossible

Itwillbenoticed thatageneral similarity underlies
these several methods ofsoul-abduction inspite oftheir
apparent variety, andthediversity oftheobjects in
view inthedifferent cases. Onthispoint itisimpos-
sible toenlarge here :thepurpose ofthisbook has
been primarily tocollect authentic specimens ofthe
various magic practices invogue among theMalays of
theMalay Peninsula, andtoindicate thenature ofthe
beliefs onwhich these practices arebased, leaving it
forothers todraw fromthem such inferences and to
make suchcomparisons asmaythrow further lighton
thesubject. Ithasnotbeendeemed desirable to
anticipate such inferences andcomparisons here;but,
without trespassing beyond thescope ofthepresent
work, itmaybenoticed thatthere isaspecial appro-
priateness inconcluding itwith theabove account of
thevarious methods ofsoul-abduction. From them,
taken together withwhat hasalready been saidonthe
subject,1afairly complete ideacanbegathered ofthe
Malay conception oftheSoul
;and itishardly too
much tosaythat thisconception isthecentral feature
ofthewhole system ofMalay magic and folklore,
fromwhich allthedifferent branches with their various
applications appear tospring.
The root-idea seems tobean all -pervading
Animism, involving acertain common vital principle
(semangat)inMan andNature, which, forwant ofa
more suitable word, hasbeen here called theSoul.
The application ofthisgeneral theory oftheuniverse
1Supra,pp.47-54, 76,77,452-456, andunder theheadings Birds, Beasts,
Vegetation, Minerals, etc.


580 DIVINATION ANDTHEBLACK ART CHAP. VI
totherequirements oftheindividual man constitutes
theMagic Art,which, asconceived bytheMalays,
may besaid toconsist ofthemethods bywhich
this Soul, whether ingods, men, animals, vege-
tables, minerals, orwhat not,may beinfluenced,
captured, subdued, orinsomewaymade subject tothe
willofthemagician.
Itwould, however, probably beamistake topush
thisanalysis toofar;forsidebysidewith thetheory
ofauniverse animated bysouls, which bytheuseof
theappropriate words andforms canbecajoled or
threatened, there aretheideas ofLuck and Ill-luck,
andthenotion, strong inMuhammadans allover the
world, ofapreordained course ofevents. Sometimes,
presumably inextreme cases, there isnoescape from
thisdestiny :ifaman isfated todieatacertain time,
diehemust, whatever hemay do.But toagreat
extent ill-luck canbeavoided ifoneknows how;
though wecannot stop it,weneed notexpose our-
selves toitsinfluence. Thus aparticular hourmay
beunlucky forthedoing ofacertain act;but ifwe
know that itisso,weneed notincur thedanger.
There are,therefore, foraMalay three alternatives,
itwould seem :viz.Charms, foroccasions where moral
pressure canbebrought tobear;Divination, toassist
indetecting dangers which intheordinary course
mustcome butcanbeavoided;and, Anally, Islam
(Resignation), when hehastomeet the inevitable,
whether itberegarded asthecourse ofFate orthe
eternal purpose ofGod.

Tepong tawar,9tepong jati
Menawar sakalian bisa,menolak sakalian bala.
1Gendala,elsewhere menala (v.infr.) :
(a) Ican findnothing nearer toitinthe
dictionaries than gendala (with across-
reference tokendala)inKlinkert, who ex-
plains itasmeaning anobstacle orhindrance.
Ifthis isright itmayperhaps betranslated
“Hold-fast,” asaeuphemism for“snares”;
(b)ontheother hand, if,asseems most likely,
menala isthecorrect form, itmaysimply stand
formendala (=bandala,abundle), and so
mean “enter mysack”;(c)oritmayeven
conceivably mean “entermycircle” (referring
tothecircular hut), from aSanskrit word
meaning circle ordisc(v.Kl. s.v. ).This,
however, seems far-fetched, andperhaps(b)is
themost natural explanation.
2Raja Sakti,“Magic Prince,” aeuphem-
ismforthehut(bumbun);possibly inallusion
tothewizard concealed inside it.
3Raja Gila,“Prince Distraction,” a
euphemism forthedecoy-tube(buluh dekut).
4Do'Ding isevidently aname given in
allusion tosome kind ofpigeon, buttheonly
pigeon name which comes atallnear itis
puding. Itisquite possible that thismay
beright, although oneofmyinformants told
methat itwasmeant torefer toakind ofpigeon called rangob,which isnotgiven in
Klinkert’s dictionary.
5Madukara wasexplained tomebya
Malay asreferring toakind ofpigeon gener-
ally called punei jambu. Klinkert only
gives madoe-kara asmeaning “silken stuff
inwoven with gold orembroidered with a
special pattern,” etc.
6Lapek,v.1.sumpit (aricebag).
7Menturun, theSelangor name ofthebear-
cat(Arctictis binturong).
8Dokoh isacrescent-shaped breast-orna-
ment rather than anecklace intheordinary
sense. Still itissuspended round theneckof
thewearer, andnecklace isperhaps thebest
translation. Imayremark thatsucha“neck-
lace” (dokoh) isoften wornbyMalay brides
and bridegrooms, andmay even beseen
decorating theneck ofananimal, such asthe
buffalo, when itisdressed upandsentasa
present tosome great man.
9Tawar means toneutralise (thepower or
effect of)anything. Hence itisapplied even to
theneutralising ofthepower ofdiseases andof
evil spirits, aswellasofnoxious potions and
influences.

eating human flesh.
2SiAnu:
thename ofthevictim orvictims
should bementioned here.
3Kalangan darah:
itisdifficult tosee
theexactmeaning ofthisphrase;atfirstsight
itlooks like“the curse ofthebarring ofthe
blood,” butmyMalay authority insisted that it
meant the“blood-bars,” and that itwasan
allusion tothebones, which were supposed to
“bar off”blood from blood, andthatthereal
significance ofthephrase was“choked to
death with bones.” Itlooks tome,however,
much more likeamistake for,orvariation of,
thephrase mengklan darah, ofwhich there
areplenty ofexamples;butuntilmore instancesarecollected theexplanation must becon-
sidered doubtful.
4Biak kembang, d.s.b.:
“increase and
multiply” istheonly sense given tobiak or
bijak (v.Kl.s.v.), butthephrase maypossibly
becorrupt.
5Sambu Agak, Sambu Agai:
inother
charms “Jambu Rakai” isgiven, which evi-
dently corresponds to“Sambu Agai,” and is
thename given tothehuman being who,
according towhat must undoubtedly bethe
older (pre-Muhammadan) legend, wasmeta-
morphosed into the crocodile. The story
which makes thefirstcrocodile aplaything into
which Muhammad’s daughter Fatimah gave
life,must atanyrate inthatrespect bemuch
modified byMuhammadan ideas, butthere are
indications herewhich seem topoint tothe
interweaving oftwoseparate stories(v.supra).

being ofiron,andhence emblematic ofearth,
thebowl ofwater inwhich the filewas tobe
dipped emblematic ofwater ingeneral, andthe
limes emblematic ofthevegetable creation, itwasnecessary toinvoke thethree “Prophets”
whoaresupposed tobeincharge ofthose de-

probable thatthese lineshave taken theplace
ofanolder invocation now forgotten. Their

“Sixth. Mix thesenna leaves with curds. This mixture operates asan

“Seventh.
Ifsenna betaken with goat’s milk, itwillcause anaccession of
strength, though complete weakness existed justbefore.
“Eighth. Ifsenna betaken with dates, everything offensive isremoved
from themouth, andthebody ismade healthy, andagood appetite isestablished.
“Ninth. Ifsenna betaken with pomegranates, thebodybecomes strong,
andthough thepatient maybeold,nevertheless there isanaddition ofstrength,
andtheorgans ofthechest arecleansed, andtheappetites arestimulated.
‘1Tenth. Ifsenna betaken with grapes, itgives light totheeyeswhich were
dim. This isproved byexperience.
“Eleventh. Ifsenna bedrunk with vinegar, itcures feveraccompanied by
shivering andtrembling ofthebones, andexpels allmischief from thestomach,
andcleanses theorgans ofthechest.
“Twelfth. Ifsenna leaves betaken with orange juice, allinternal heat is
removed, andamanwhowasbefore quite thin willspeedily grow fat.
“Thirteenth. Ifsenna isdrunk withdew, theeyesbecome bright and clear.
“Fourteenth. Ifsenna istaken inwater inwhich pomegranate peelhas
been boiled, itcures dysentery.
“Fifteenth. Ifsenna isboiled with cocoa-nut water andtaken internally, it
willcure diabetes and gravel, bythewillofGod ever tobepraised andMost

Thus theproperties ofthesenna ofMecca areconcluded under fifteen

third round theblade atthismark asfollows:—Seethat itsextreme endexactly
coincides with the leftside oftheblade, andstretch itacross theblade atright
angles, bending thestrip ofleafround theedge attheexact spotreached onthe
opposite edge oftheblade bymaking adent butnotsevering the leaf. Then
measure itasecond timefrom thedent thusmade, making asecond dentonthe

appeared tohim,andtoldhim tolook forak'rissapukal inthepossession ofa
manwhowasdigging upremis ortepeh (akind ofmollusc ?).TohMujud
went accordingly tolook fortheman,andonmeeting withonesooccupied at
Pulau Labuhan Bilek, nearTanjong Tuan, found thathehadaveryoldand
rusty k'ris, which hethereupon bought fromhim for25cents. Armed with this
k'risTohMujud thenfound andslew hisadversary, and theproportions ofthe
lucky weapon corresponded with themeasurement here given.
Fold thestring orstrip ofleaf,andcut itinhalf. Take oneofthehalves,
fold it,andmeasure from thepoint upwards asfarasitwill go.Mark thespot,
andmeasure offthestring inbreadths ofthe k'ris atthatspot :there mustbe
tenbreadths, and atthemeasuring ofthetenth theend ofthestring mustbein
thecentre oftheblade, ifitistobeofanyuse.
Then take theother half, fold italsointwo,andmeasure upfrom thebottom
oftheblade asfarasthefolded string willgo :theremust beseven breadths of
theblade inthelength ofthehalf string, andtheendofthestring should come
within ahair’s-breadth oftheedge oftheblade, or,astheMalays say,“leaving
space forananttopass.”
4.Another method isknown astheUkoran Genap,orUkorMandar (of
Celebes).
Fold thestring intwo,andmeasure offthehalf-length thus obtained on
theblade, commencing atthebottom. Then seehowmany times thebreadth
oftheblade iscontained inthewhole length ofthestring, which should be
fourteen.
5.Another wayofmeasuring, toseehowmany thumbs’-breadths there are
inthelength oftheblade, isasfollows. Itisnotconsidered ofmuch importance :—Laytherightthumb across thefoot oftheblade near thehilt,andthethumb
ofthe lefthand alsoontheblade immediately above theother;continue placing
thethumbs alternately oneinfront oftheother until thepoint isreached, repeat-
ing forthe firstthumb’s-breadth thewordgzmong (mountain), forthesecond
runtoh (fall), forthethirdmadu (honey), forthefourth segara (ocean), after
which recommence withgunong, and soon. Ifgunong ormadu brings the
thumb tothepoint theblade isagood one, butnot ifitisruntoh or
segara.
6.Another measurement isthus described :—Putthetipoftherightthumb
upon thespotwhere the hiltjoins theblade, with theback ofthe first joint
against theblade;next tothisputthe leftthumb horizontally across theblade,
andcontinue toalternate the first joint oftherightthumb with thebreadth of
theleft tillthepoint ofthek'ris isreached, repeating asfollows:—
Forthelength ofthe firstjoint oftherightthumb .berjong.
Forthebreadth oftheleftthumb . . .berkapal.

NOTEONTHEWORDKRAMAT
The following isanextract from aletter bytheauthor which was received too
lateforinsertion inthetextofthebook:—
“Ithink thatthebest translation forkramat,inthecaseofbeasts, etc., is
‘sacred.’ Ihavebeengoing intothekramat question, and itappears tomethat
kramat animals, trees, andother objects occupy thesame place inMalay popular
religion asisoccupied byTotems inthepopular religion ofother countries.
“Idonotwish tobeunderstood (before going more deeply still into the
matter) thatthey aretotems, butthatthey possess, generally speaking, thesame
characteristics. They arethebodily tenements orreceptacles containing the
souls ofthedeparted ancestors ofthevillage. Incense isburnt andprayers are
offered tothem {e.g. inthecaseofthesacred elephant), and themere factof
meeting themwhen one isengaged inadifficult enterprise isbelieved toinsure
success. Ontheother hand, tokillorwound them istocourt disaster.”
Totheabove Imayadd thatkramat (which isaword ofArabic derivation)
properly appears tomean “sanctity,” but isinMalay generally used adjectively,
being applied tomen, animals, plants, stones, etc.When theword stands alone
italmost invariably means aholyplace,theword tempat being presumably under-
stood. When applied toaperson itimplies special sanctity andmiraculous
power. Iremember, in1895, hearing ofalittle girl, living withherparents at
Sungei Baru intheAlorGajah district ofMalacca, whowasreputed tobekramat.
People used totravel considerable distances inorder tovisit her,andthereby gain
some benefit orother. Iwasinformed thatthemodus operandi was toswallow
asmall quantity ofhersaliva inacupofwater, but Inever verified this state-
ment. These pilgrimages were rather disapproved ofbythelocal Kathi, who
wasmyinformant.
Asregards truetotemism, Iamnotsure that itcanbetraced among the
Malays ofthePeninsula, although afewelements ofthesystem aretobefound
hereandthereamong them. Thus, forinstance, incertain districts {e.g.northern
Malacca andtheNegri Sembilan) there areclans descending inthefemale line
among whom exogamy isstilltherule, totheextent, atleast, thatintermarriage
isforbidden between thechildren ofsisters(J.R.A.S.,S.B .,No. 23,p.143);
andwealsosometimes find tutelary ortaboo animals, etc.more orlessclosely
connected with certain families;butthesetwo setsoffacts donotseem tobe
interwoven astheyappear tobeamong certain other races. Traces ofanimals,
etc.being regarded asspecially connected with particular families arenot, I
believe, verycommon :twoinstances occur intheSejarah Malay u,viz.theman
“Bat’h,” whoemerged fromfoam vomited byabull{Malay Annals,p.23),and
who isregarded astheprogenitor ofthe still existing Malay tribe (Bangsa
Muntah Lembu) ofhereditary bards, towhom beef, milk, etc.aretaboo1
;andthe
Indian prince “Mani Farendan” {ibid. p.no),whoonhisvoyage toMalacca
1J.R.A.S., S.B.,No. 14,p.313.

674 NOTE
waspreserved fromdrowning bythealu-alu fishand thegandasuli tree,andon
thataccount‘‘forbade allhisdescendants toeatofthe fishalu-alu ortowear
theflower ofthegandasulid’ Hisdescendants formed anoble family inMalacca,
theheads ofwhich usually bore the titleofS’riNaradiraja, andduring the15th
century a.d. often held thehighest offices ofstate;sothelegend may, probably
enough, preserve therecord ofanactual custom peculiar tothat family. Both
theabove cases, however, seem tobederived from aHindu origin.
The tutelary animals connected with holy(kramal) places mayperhaps some-
times beinpoint inthisconnection :forinstance, atMalacca Pindah, inMalacca
territory, Iremember seeing theprivate burial-place ofacertain family (which
lived close by),andbeing informed bythelocal village headman that,whenever
anymember ofthat family died, certain tigers were inthehabit ofwailing
(menangis)round theplace atnight.
Ithasbeen observed bytheauthor (pp. 71,153, 163) thatkramat animals
generally havesome physical peculiarity, such asashrunken footorstunted tusk;
itmaybeadded thatthey aresometimes white(i.e .albino individuals ofaspecies
which isnotusually white), and thusmarked outfrom their fellows bythe
characteristic sacred colour. Iremember reading inthelocal Straits newspaper
some years agothatawhite mouse-deer, which wascaught somewhere inthe
Negri Sembilan, wasregarded bytheMalays askraviat :verysoon after its
capture, Ibelieve onthesame evening, itescaped from itscage overnight, afact
which nodoubt further corroborated thenatives intheir belief astoitssacred
character. Ihave littledoubt that itwaspurposely released bysome super-
stitious Malay, whothought thatnogoodwould come ofkeeping asacred animal
incaptivity.
