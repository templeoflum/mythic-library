THE HEALTH SEEKER'S VADE MECUM.

(_Revised up to Date._)

_Question._ Is it good for the health to keep awake?

_Answer._ Certainly not; as sleep is most necessary to the body's
repose.

_Q._ Then should one go to sleep?

_A._ No; for it must in the end be injurious to the mind.

_Q._ Is walking a good thing?

_A._ Certainly not; as it may lead to cramp.

_Q._ Is resting to be recommended?

_A._ Oh no; for exercise is absolutely a necessity.

_Q._ Is riding permissible?

_A._ Not when the wood pavement produces the new sore throat.

_Q._ Should we eat?

_A._ No; for everything is adulterated.

_Q._ Should we drink?

_A._ No; liquor is injurious.

_Q._ Should we starve?

_A._ No; meals are really needful.

_Q._ Is it safe to stay at home?

_A._ No; because change of air is most beneficial to everyone.

_Q._ Is it advisable to go abroad?

_A._ Not at all; many epidemics are reported to be rife everywhere on
the other side of the channel.

_Q._ Is it good to live?

_A._ Scarcely; because illness is worse than death.

_Q._ Is it good to die?

_A._ Probably; everything else is a failure, so no doubt this, too, is
a grand mistake.

UNDER THE ROOSE.

RONDEL BY A RESTORED ONE.

(_Some way after a Swinburnian Model._)

  Under the ROOSE! Decay seemed slow but sure,
  The golden chord Mors, lingering, aimed to loose;
  But kindness, care, and skill work wondrous cure,
  Under the ROOSE!

  The patient probably had played the goose,
  Liverish, listless, yielding to the lure
  Of overstrain, caught in neglect's sly noose.

  But symptoms pass if patience but endure,
  And ROBSON'S regimen brooks no excuse.
  Nerves get re-strung, the brisk blood pulses pure,
  Under the ROOSE!

OLD PROVERB VERIFIED.--"Miss VERNE, whose renown as a pianist is
rapidly increasing, has hitherto been known to concert-goers as Miss
MATHILDE WURM." So at last "the WURM has turned," and become Miss
VERNE!

  ["Here comes a light to light us to bed,
  And a chopper to cut off the last--last--last Amendment's head!"

  _Old Nursery Rhyme "amended."_]

  There once was a Government good--
  (All Governments are, so they tell us!)--
  Who found themselves deep "in the wood,"
  And a little bit blown in the "bellows."
  Their foes, who were many and mean,
  Persistently hunted and harried 'em.
  Their time they to spend meant
  On bogus "Amendment;"
  They moved such by hundreds--and _all_ to befriend meant--
  Jawed round 'em, and--now and then--carried 'em!
  Singing fol-de-rol-lol-de-rol-lol!
  That Government upped and it said--
  "We seem to be getting no forrader.
  It's time to go 'full steam ahead!'
  _Bella horrida_ couldn't be horrider,
  So let's declare 'war to the knife!'
  Dr. GUILLOTIN'S knife, sharp and summary,
  We _must_ put a stopper
  On Unionist 'whopper,'
  Or else the best Government must come a cropper
  Along of their falsehood and flummery!"
  Singing fol-de-rol-lol-de-rol-lol!
  "Doctor GUILLOTIN claimed that his blade
  Was 'a punishment sure, quick, and uniform,'
  So when sham 'Amendment' has laid
  On the table its paltry and puny form,
  We'll just give it time to turn round,
  And if it's prolix or cantankerous,
  To the block be it led
  And then--off with its head!"--
  Well, for summary shrift there _is_ much to be said,
  When the criminal's rowdy and rancorous.
  Singing fol-de-rol-lol-de-rol-lol!

SUB JUDICE.

(_An entirely Imaginary Report of an utterly Impossible Case._)

THE MUSTARD MYSTERY. 120TH DAY.

To-day the prisoner in this matter was once again brought before
the magistrates on the charge already stated. The same counsel
were present for the prosecution and the defence that had put in an
appearance yesterday. The court was densely crowded.

BENJAMIN BROWN deposed that he had often slammed a door. He knew the
sound of the slamming of a door, and thought he could distinguish it
from the noise of an earthquake. On cross examination he admitted
that he had not slammed a door, and had never been present at an
earthquake. On re-examination he said that although he had not been
present at an earthquake he was conversant with its characteristics.

JOHN JONES deposed that he had once seen a man who might have been the
prisoner. It was sixteen years ago. The man to whom he referred was
talking to a female. On cross-examination he admitted that, so far
as he knew to the contrary, the man may have been addressing his
grandmother. On re-examination he did not know that the female was a
grandmother--she might have been a grand aunt.

RICHARD ROBERTSON deposed that he had seen a pair of slippers. They
might have been the slippers of the prisoner. He saw one of those
slippers thrown with considerable force at a water-butt. He
had examined the water-butt, and there was a mark on it. On
cross-examination he admitted that he did not know how the mark on
the water-butt had been made. It might have been by a boot, and not
a slipper. He did not know to whom the slippers belonged. They might
have been the property of the prisoner. He was not sure that he had
seen the slippers in the presence of the prisoner. In fact, he was not
sure he had ever seen the prisoner before. He was also doubtful about
the identity of the slippers. However, on re-examination, he was sure
he had seen some slippers, and also a water-butt.

After some further evidence, the inquiry was adjourned until
to-morrow.
