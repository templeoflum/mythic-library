THE THREE GEORGES.

The following two letters have reached _Mr. Punch_, curiously enough,
by the same post. Here they are, just as they were received:--

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--Will you allow me, through your columns, to thank the
public for the brilliant way in which they are recognising my claims
to distinction? As I walk through the streets I see evidence on all
hands that on Thursday night London will be ablaze with "G. M."!
Permit me, Sir, thus publicly to thank a discriminating public.--Yours
Egoist-ically,

  G-ORGE M-R-D-TH.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,--The Alderman in Art is beaten, and even the City is
one continuous tribute to "G. M." Critics, envious of my _Speaker_
reputation, may carp, and say the tribute's all gas--a half-truth,
concealing truth; but the public evidently know where to look for the
true critical insight. I am obliged to them, and I thank you for this
opportunity of saying so.

  Yours (naturally) as fresh as paint,
  G-ORGE M-RE.

       *       *       *       *       *

SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN BETTER LEFT UNSAID. (_By an ex-Old Bachelor,
discontented with his condition in general, and his Mother-in-law in
particular_).--"I will!"

A WEDDING FAVOUR.--A reserved first-class compartment on the London,
Chatham and Dover.

AD FRATREM.

BY A REMONSTRATIVE SISTER.

(_See "Ad Examinatorem," Punch, July 1, 1893._)

  Dear Tom, you astonished me quite
  With your vigorous verses last week,
  It will be an unceasing delight
  In future, sweet brother, to speak
  Of the family poet--yourself!
  Yet I feel I must bid you beware.
  It may not be nice, but the word of advice
  Is your favourite, "Don't lose your hair!"

  Yes, I own it was rather a blow
  When they brought out the merciless list,
  For you primed up the Pater, I know,
  With such rubbish, and just _would_ insist
  The Exam. was as hard as could be.
  Ah! you painted it all at the worst,
  It was hard lines on you, THOMAS, not to get through,
  While the "crock" of a MAUD got a first.

  Still, why did you rush into print
  With your torrent of bitter complaint?
  To do so without the least hint,
  Well, brotherly, dear, it quite _ain't_.
  'Twere wiser and better by far
  To have laid all the blame on a tooth,
  For whatever's the use of a lovely excuse
  If not in concealing the truth?

  So bottle your anger, dear boy,
  Forget how to shuffle and shirk,
  Find intelligent purpose and joy
  In a season of honest hard work.
  You'll pass when you go in again,
  And eclipse in the passing poor me;
  For a girl, though she can beat the whole tribe of Man,
  Isn't fit, TOM, to have a degree!

       *       *       *       *       *

THE SONG OF THE SESSION.

AIR--"_What shall he have that kill'd the Deer?_"

  What must he have who'd kill the Bill?
  A leathern skin, and a stubborn will.
  Brummagem's his home.
  Take then no shame to name his name!
  Bill-slaughtering is his little game.
  He'd be its death--he swore it,
  As limb from limb he tore it--
  The Bill, the Bill, the lusty Bill!
  Is it a thing Brum JOE _can_ kill?

A TESTIMONIAL MANQUE.

(A SKETCH FROM THE SUBURBS.)

THE ARGUMENT--Mr. HOTSPUR PORPENTINE, _a distinguished resident in the
rising suburb of Jerrymere, has recently been awarded fourteen
days' imprisonment, without the option of a fine, for assaulting a
ticket-collector, who had offered him the indignity of requiring him
to show his season-ticket at the barrier. The scene is a Second-Class
Compartment, in which four of_ Mr. PORPENTINE'S _neighbours are
discussing the affair during their return from the City_.

_Mr. Cockcroft (warmly)._ I say, Sir--and I'm sure all here will bear
me out--that such a sentence was a scandalous abuse of justice. As
a near neighbour, and an intimate friend of PORPENTINE'S, I don't
'esitate to assert that he has done nothing whatever to forfeit our
esteem. He's a quick-tempered man, as we're all aware, and to be asked
by some meddlesome official to show his season, after travelling
on the line constantly for years, and leaving it at home that
morning--why--I don't blame him if he _did_ use his umbrella!

_Mr. Balch. (sympathetically)._ Nor I. PORPENTINE'S a man I've always
had a very 'igh respect for ever since I came into this neighbourhood.
I've always found him a good feller, and a good neighbour.

_Mr. Filkins (deferentially)._ I can't claim to be as intimate with
him as some here; but, if it isn't putting myself too far forward to
say so, I very cordially beg to say ditto to those sentiments.

_Mr. Sibbering_ (_who has never "taken to"_ PORPENTINE). Well, he's
had a sharp lesson,--there's no denying that.

_Mr. Cocker._ Precisely, and it occurs to me that when he--ah--returns
to public life, it would be a kind thing, and a graceful thing, and
a thing he would--ah--appreciate in the spirit it was intended, if
we were to present him with some little token of our sympathy and
unabated esteem--what do you fellers think?

_Mr. Filk._ A most excellent suggestion, if my friend here will allow
me to say so. I, for one, shall be proud to contribute to so worthy an
object.

_Mr. Balch._ I don't see why we shouldn't present him with an
address--'ave it illuminated, and framed and glazed; sort of thing
he could 'ang up and 'and down to his children after him as an
_heirloom_, y' know.

_Mr. Sibb._ I don't like to throw cold water on any proposition, but
if you want _my_ opinion, I must say I see no necessity for making a
public thing of it in that way.

_Mr. Cocker._ I'm with SIBBERING there. The less fuss there is about
it, the better PORPENTINE'll be pleased. My idea is to give him
something of daily use--a _useful_ thing, y' know.

_Mr. Balch._ Useful _or_ ornamental. Why not his own portrait? There's
many an artist who would do him in oils, and guarantee a likeness,
frame included, for a five-pound note.

_Mr. Sibb._ If it's to be like PORPENTINE, it certainly won't be
_ornamental_, whatever else it is.

_Mr. Filk._ It can't be denied that he is remarkably plain in the
face. We'd better, as our friend Mr. COCKCROFT here proposes, make it
something of daily use--a good serviceable silk umberella now--that's
_always_ appropriate.

_Mr. Sibb._ To make up for the one he broke over the collector's head,
eh? that's _appropriate_ enough!

_Mr. Cocker._ No, no; you mean well, FILKINS, but you must see
yourself, on reflection, that there would be a certain want
of--ah--good taste in giving him a thing like that under the
circumstances. I should suggest something like a hatstand--a handsome
one, of course. I happen to know that he has nothing in the passage at
present but a row of pegs.

_Mr. Sibb._ I should have thought he'd been taken down enough pegs
already.
