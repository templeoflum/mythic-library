_Mr. Filk. (who resents the imputation upon his taste)._ I can't say
what the width of Mr. PORPENTINE'S passage may be, never having been
privileged with an invitation to pass the threshold, but unless it's
wider than ours is, he couldn't get a hatstand in if he tried, and
if my friend COCKCROFT will excuse the remark, I see no sense--to say
nothing of good taste, about which perhaps I mayn't be qualified to
pass an opinion--in giving him an article he's got no room for.

_Mr. Cocker. (with warmth)._ There's room enough in PORPENTINE'S
passage for a whole host of hatstands, if that's all, and I know
what I'm speaking about. I've been in and out there often enough.
I'm--ah--a regular tame cat in that house. But if you're against the
'atstand, I say no more--we'll waive it. How would it do if we gave
him a nice comfortable easy-chair--something he could sit in of an
evening, y' know?

_Mr. Sibb._ A touchy chap like PORPENTINE would be sure to fancy
we thought he wanted something soft after a hard bench and a plank
bed--you can't go and give him _furniture_!

_Mr. Cocker. (with dignity)._ There's a way of doing all things. I
wasn't proposing to go and chuck the chair _at_ him--he's a sensitive
feller in many respects, and he'd feel _that_, I grant you. He can't
object to a little present of that sort just from four friends like
ourselves.

_Mr. Balch. (with a falling countenance)._ Oh! I thought it was to be
a general affair, limited to a small sum, so that all who liked could
join in. I'd no notion you meant to keep it such a private matter as
all that.

_Mr. Filk._ Nor I. And, knowing Mr. PORPENTINE so slightly as I do, he
might consider it presumption in me, making myself so prominent in the
matter--or else I'm sure----

_Mr. Cocker._ There's no occasion for anyone to be prominent, except
myself. You leave it entirely in my 'ands. I'll have the chair taken
up some evening to PORPENTINE'S house on a 'andcart, and drop in, and
just lead up to it carelessly, if you understand me, then go out and
wheel the chair in, make him try it--and there you _are_.

_Mr. Balch._ There _you_ are, right enough; but I don't see where _we_
come in, exactly.

_Mr. Filk._ If it's to be confined to just us four, I certingly think
we ought _all_ to be present at the presentation.

_Mr. Cocker._ That would be just the very thing to put a man like
PORPENTINE out--a crowd dropping in on him like that! I know his ways,
and, seeing I'm providing the chair----

_Mr. Balch. (relieved)._ You are? That's different, of course; but I
thought you said that we four----

_Mr. Cocker._ I'm coming to that. As the prime mover, and a particular
friend of PORPENTINE'S, it's only right and fair I should bear the
chief burden. There's an easy-chair I have at home that only wants
re-covering to be as good as new, and all you fellers need do is to
pay for 'aving it nicely done up in velvet, or what not, and we'll
call it quits.

_Mr. Balch._ I daresay; but I like to know what I'm letting myself
in for; and there's upholsterers who'll charge as much for doing up a
chair as would furnish a room.

_Mr. Filk._ I--I shouldn't feel justified, with my family, and, as,
comparatively speaking, a recent resident, in going beyond a certain
limit, and unless the estimate could be kep' down to a moderate sum, I
really----

_Mr. Sibb. (unmasking)._ After all, you know, I don't see why we
should go to any expense over a stuck-up, cross-grained chap like
PORPENTINE. It's well-known he hasn't a good word to say for us
Jerrymere folks, and considers himself above the lot of us!

_Mr. Balch and Mr. Filk._ I'm bound to say there's a good deal in what
SIBBERING says. PORPENTINE'S never shown himself what _I_ should call
sociable.

_Mr. Cocker._ I've never found him anything but pleasant myself,
whatever he may be to others. I'm not denying he's an _exclusive_ man,
and a _fastidious_ man, but he's been 'arshly treated, and _I_ should
have thought this was an occasion--if ever there was one--for putting
any private feelings aside, and rallying round him to show our respect
and sympathy. But of course if you're going to let petty jealousies
of this sort get the better of you, and leave me to do the 'ole thing
myself, _I've_ no objection. I daresay he'll value it all the more
coming from me.

_Mr. Sibb._ Well, he _ought_ to, after the shameful way he's spoken of
you to a friend of mine in the City, who shall be nameless. You
mayn't know, and if not, it's only right I should mention it, that
he complained bitterly of having to change his regular train on
your account, and said (I'm only repeating his words, mind you) that
Jerrymere was entirely populated by bores, but you were the worst of
the lot, and your jabber twice a day was more than he _could_ stand.
He mayn't have _meant_ anything by it, but it was decidedly uncalled
for.

_Mr. Cockcr. (reddening)._ I 'ope I'm above being affected by
the opinion any man may express of my conversation--especially a
cantankerous feller, who can't keep his temper under decent control. A
feller who goes and breaks his umbrella over an unoffending official's
'ead like that, and gets, very properly, locked up for it! Jerrymere
society isn't good enough for him, it seems. He won't be troubled with
much of it in future--_I_ can assure him! Upon my word, now I come
to think of it, I'm not sure he shouldn't be called upon for an
explanation of how he came to be travelling without a ticket; it looks
very much to me as if he'd been systematically defrauding the Company!

_Mr. Filk._ Well, I didn't like to say so before; but that's been _my_
view all along!

_Mr. Balch._ And mine.

_Mr. Sibb._ Now perhaps you understand why we'd rather leave it to you
to give him the arm-chair.

_Mr. Cockcr._ _I_ give a man an arm-chair for bringing disgrace on the
'ole of Jerrymere! I'd sooner break it up for firewood! Whoever it was
that first started all this tomfoolery about a testimonial, I'm not
going to 'ave _my_ name associated with it, and if you'll take
_my_ advice, you'll drop it once and for all, for it's only making
yourselves ridiculous! [_His companions, observing that he is in
a somewhat excited condition, consider it advisable to change the
subject._

OPERATIC NOTES.

_Tuesday, June 27._--_Faust_, in French. JEAN DE RESZKE was to have
been _Faust_, but the "vaulting ambition" of the eminent Polish
tenor led him to attempt a high jump with another Pole--the
leaping-pole--and whether he had not his compatriot well in hand,
or whether, "with love's light wings," _Romeo_ did _not_ manage to
"o'ertop" the highest note above the line, deponent sayeth not, but
this much is known, that he fell at the high jump, and, feeling the
pain first in the under part of his foot, and then in the leg, he
exclaimed, with _Hamlet_, "O my prophetic sole, my ankle!" the result
being that he appeareth not to-night as _Faust_. If Frere JEAN DE
RESZKE is going on by "leaps and bounds" in this manner, he will
be known as "Brother JOHN the Risky." Madame NORDICA happy as
_Marguerite_--at least she looked it, for even in the most tragic
scenes there is always a sweet smile on her dimpled cheeks. Mlle.
BAUERMEISTER makes a _Marta_ of herself as the merry old dame;
Mlle. GUERCIA, as _Siebel_, is a Siebeline mystery; LASSALLE, as
_Valentine_, pleases _la salle_; but Brother EDWARD "_prends le
gateau_" as _Mephistopheles_.
