A TALE OF THE ALHAMBRA.

Mons. JACOBI is a wonderful man. The undefeated hero of a hundred
ballets--there or thereabouts--still beats time and the record with
his baton at the Alhambra; and his music, specially composed for
_Fidelia_, is to be reckoned among his ordinary triumphs. _Fidelia_ is
"a new Grand Romantic Ballet," in four tableaux, and its performance
justifies its promise. It is "new," it is decidedly "grand," it is
absorbingly "romantic," and there's no denying that it is a _Ballet
d'action_. But, as in the oft-quoted reply when little _Peterkin_
asked "what it was all about," so will the ballet-case-hardened
spectator say, "'Why that I cannot tell,' quoth he, 'But 'twas a
splendid victory!'" Somebody, possibly one _Tartini_, played by
Signorina CORMANI, is in love with _Fidelia_, Signorina POLLINI, as
naturally anyone would be; when a comic servant, Mr. GEORGE LUPINO,
is frightened by a Demon Fiddler with his fiddle (both being played by
PAGANINI REDIVIVUS) who either assists the lovers or does his best to
prevent their coming together, I am not quite clear which. Up to the
last it seemed doubtful whether the Demon Doctor was a good or bad
spirit, or a little mixed. His appearance is decidedly against him,
as he looks the very deuce. But I am inclined to think that he was
a "_bon diable_," and was doing everything, as everybody else on the
stage and in the orchestra does, for the best. After all, and before
all, the show is the thing, and this will rank, as it does now, among
the best of the greatest attractions hitherto provided by the Alhambra
Company for an appreciative public and for

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.

Madam DARMESTETER'S _Retrospect and other Poems_ is turned out by
FISHER UNWIN in that dainty dress with which he has made attractive
his Cameo Series. We used to know Madam DARMESTETER as Miss MARY F.
ROBINSON, a writer of charming verse. That in her new estate she has
not lost the old touch is witnessed by several pieces in this volume,
notably the first, which supplies the title. The penultimate verse of
this little lyric is most musical. There are several others nearly as
good. But occasionally Madam writes sad stuff. Of such is _The Death
of the Count of Armaniac_, of which this verse is a fair sample:

  "ARMANIAC, O ARMANIAC,
  Why rode ye forth at noon?
  Was there no hour at even,
  No morning cool and boon?"

My Baronite, though not yet entered for the Poet Laureateship, thinks
that kind of thing might be reeled off by the mile. Why not

  My Maniac, O my Maniac,
  Why rode ye forth at eve?
  Was there no hour at morning tide,
  No water in the sieve?

Three years ago an American firm issued a princely edition of _The
Memoir of Horace Walpole_, written by AUSTIN DOBSON. It was too
expensive for mere Britishers, and only a small number of copies found
their way to this country. But the literary work was so excellent,
that it was pronounced a pity it should be entombed in this costly
sarcophagus. Messrs. OSGOOD, MCILVAINE, & CO. have now brought out an
edition, in a single handsome volume, at a reasonable price. HORACE
WALPOLE has often been written about since he laid down the pen,
but never by a more sympathetic hand than Mr. DOBSON'S, nor by
one bringing to the task fuller knowledge of WALPOLE'S time and
contemporaries. The charm of style extends even to the notes, usually
in books of this class a tantalising adjunct. Mr. DOBSON'S are so full
of information, and so crisply told, that they might with advantage
have been incorporated in the text. The volume contains facsimiles of
HORACE WALPOLE'S handwriting, an etching of LAWRENCE'S portrait, and
a reproduction of the sketch of Strawberry Hill which illustrated the
catalogue of 1774. Altogether a delightful book that will, my Baronite
says, take its place on a favourite shelf of the library that has
grown up round the memory of one of the most interesting figures of
the Eighteenth Century.

WEAR AND TEAR IN AFRICA.

    [In the report on the proposed Mombasa Railway, it is
    suggested that the station-buildings should be enclosed with a
    strong live-thorn palisade, impenetrable to arrows.]

SCENE--_A Station on the Mombasa Railway._

_New Station-Master_ (_to_ Telegraph Clerk). Did you send my message
this morning, asking for a consignment of revolvers and arrow-proof
shields?

_Telegraph Clerk._ Yes, Sir. I can't make out why we haven't had an
answer. Something may have gone wrong with the wires. I sent one of
the porters to examine them. Ah, here he comes.

_A Porter arrives._

_Porter._ Just as I thought, Sir. Them blessed niggers have run short
of cash, and they've bin and took a mile of our best wire.

_Station-Master._ Taken a mile of wire? What the deuce do you mean?

_Porter._ Ah, Sir, you're new to this 'ere job. Fact is, they can all
buy theirselves a wife a-piece for two yards of our wire; and as there
was a raid last week, and all their wives was made off with, they've
just bin and took our telegraph wire to buy theirselves a new lot.

_Station-Master._ Dear me, how very provoking. I must make a report of
this occurrence immediately! But what does this crowd in the distance
mean?

_Porter._ Why bless my heart, it's a Wednesday, and I'd quite
forgotten all about it. They always attacks us of a Wednesday, but
they're a good half hour earlier than last week.

_Station-Master._ This is very strange, very strange indeed. I doubt
if the directors will approve of this. (_An arrow pierces him in the
calf of the leg._) Oh, I say, you know, this will never do. Close the
points--I mean shut the doors and barricade the windows. Let us at
least die as railway men should.

_Porter._ Lor' bless you, Sir, we shan't die. We've only got to pick
off two or three dozen of 'em, and the rest will skip in no time.

  [_They retire within the palisade, and during the next half hour
  fight for their lives._

_Telegraph Clerk_ (_plucking three arrows out of his left leg_).
Things are getting a bit hot. Hurrah! here's the 5.30 down express
with revolvers and ammunition. Now we shall settle 'em.

  [_Arrival of the express. Retreat of the natives._

_Station-Master._ I don't think I quite like this life. I'm going to
off it.

  [_Offs it accordingly._

AN OLD MAN'S MUSINGS.

(_After an Afternoon Pipe, at Nazareth House, Hammersmith._)

  ["Here again, clustered close round the fire
  Are a number of grizzle-lock'd men, every one is a true 'hoary
          sire.'
  Bowed, time-beaten, grey, yet alert and responsive to kindness of
          speech;
  And see how old eyes can light up if you promise a pipe-charge to
          each.
  For the comforting weed KINGSLEY eulogised is not taboo in this
          place,
  Where the whiff aromatic brings not cold reproval to Charity's
          face."
