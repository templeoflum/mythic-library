_Wednesday._--_Tristan und Isolde_, which may be rendered _Triste
'un und I solde-not-so-many-tickets-as-usual_, or _Triste 'un und I'm
Sold_. "The fourth of the WAGNER Cycle." If there are eight of them
then this is the Bi-Cycle, but there's more woe than weal in it, and
though extracts may be relished by the learned amateur, yet, as a
whole, WAGNER'S _Tristan_ does not attract our opera-going public.

TO THE FRENCH OARSMEN.

(_From Mr. Punch, at Henley._)

  Here's a hand, my fine fellows; in friendship you come,
  And _Punch_, who likes courage, would scorn to be dumb.
  He greets you with cheers; may your shades ne'er diminish,
  Though you row forty-four from the start to the finish.
  You will bear yourselves bravely, and merit your fame,
  For brave man and Frenchman mean mostly the same.
  We shall do what we can--it's our duty--to beat you,
  But we know it will take a tough crew to defeat you.
  And whatever the upshot, howe'er the race ends,
  You and we, having struggled, shall always be friends.
  So accept, while we cheer you again and again,
  This welcome from Thames to his sister, the Seine.

SKINNERS AND SKINNED.--One portion of the ancient award of Sir ROBERT
BILLESDON, Lord Mayor of London, in settling a dispute between the
Skinners and Merchant Taylors, was, that these two Companies should
dine together once a year. Mr. Justice BRUCE, alluding to this at
the banquet on Skinners Day, when, as was natural, many lawyers were
present, suggested that it would be a good thing if power were given
to judges to "condemn litigants to dine together, and to order that
the costs of the dinner should come out of the Consolidated Fund"--a
very good notion. The idea might be extended to entertaining Wards in
Chancery, of whom two unhappy infants the other day were had up at the
Police Court for picking and stealing, in order to feed themselves and
keep themselves alive until they should reach the age when they would
come into their Chancery-bound property of something like L20,000. The
magistrate ordered an inquiry, but of "subsequent proceedings" we have
not as yet seen any record.

"HYMEN HYMENAEE!!!"

JULY 6, 1893.

    ["Bid her awake; for Hymen is awake!"

    _Spenser's Epithalamion._

    "A contract of true love to celebrate; And some donation
    freely to estate On the bless'd lovers."--_The Tempest._]

  Hymen, the rose-crowned, is in sooth awake,
  And all the world with him!
  Shall drowsy opiate dim
  The eyes of Love to-day? No, let all slake
  A loyal thirst in bumpers, for Love's sake,
  Full beaded to the brim!

  Like the Venusian's "mountain stream that roars
  From bank to bank along,
  When autumn rains are strong,"[A]
  A deep-mouthed People lifts its voice, and pours
  Its welcome forth, that like a Paean soars
  In strains more sweet than song.

  More sweet than song, in that it straightway comes,
  Unfeigned, from frank hearts;
  From loyal lips it starts,
  Unprompted, undragooned. The highway hums
  With the full sound of it. Fifes, trumpets, drums
  Bravely may play their parts.

  In the Imperial pageant, but the swell
  Of the free English shout
  Strikes sweeter--who dares doubt?--
  On Royal ears. Music of marriage bell
  Clang on, and let the gold-mouth'd organ tell
  Of love and praise devout!

  But the crowd's vigorous clamour has a voice
  Finer and fuller still;
  A passion of goodwill
  Rings, to our ears, through all the exuberant noise,
  Which the recipient's heart should more rejoice
  Than all Cecilia's skill.

  So rivals for Apollo's laurel wreath
  May loudly strike the lyre,
  "To love, and young desire;"[B]
  But "bold and lawless numbers grow beneath"[B]
  The people's praise, and give the crowd's free breath
  A "mastering touch of fire."[B]

  "Hymen, O Hymen!" beauteous ladies cry,
  "Hymen, O Hymen!" loud
  Shout forth the echoing crowd
  The city through; patricians perched on high,
  And the plebeian patient plodding by,
  Raise incense like a cloud.

  And Hymen's here, kind eye on all to keep,
  Hymen, with roses crowned,
  Leads on the Lion, bound
  In floral bonds and blossom-bridled, deep
  In scattered flowers. Your lyres ye laureates sweep,
  And marriage measures sound!

  Not Una's guardian more gladly bare
  Burden more pleasant--pure!
  With footing gently sure
  Leo on-paces. Hymen's torch in air
  Flames fragrantly. Was ever Happy Pair
  So served, or so secure?

  Take the rose-reins, young bridegroom; bridled so
  Leo's not hard to ride.
  Sweet MAY, the new-made bride,
  Will find her lion palfrey-paced. And lo!
  The genial god's unfailing torch aglow
  Burns bravely at her side!

  Epithalamia seem out of date;
  Hymen cares not to-day
  To trill a fulsome lay,
  Or hymn High Bridals with Spenserian state.
  Goodwill to goodness simply dedicate,--
  Such homage _Punch_ would pay.

  "Hymen, O Hymen!" Like this torch's flame,
  Bright be your wedded days!
  May a proud people's praise,
  Well earned, be your award of honest fame;
  And on each gracious head,
  Light may it lie, the crown you yet may claim,
  As rest these roses red!
