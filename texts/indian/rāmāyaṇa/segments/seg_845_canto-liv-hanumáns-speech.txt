Canto LIV. Hanumán’s Speech.


But Hanumán, while Tára, best
Of splendid chiefs his thought expressed,
Perceived that Báli’s princely son
A kingdom for himself had won.(757)
His keen eye marked in him combined
The warrior’s arm, the ruler’s mind,
And every noble gift should grace
The happy sovereign of his race:
Marked how he grew with ripening age
More glorious and bold and sage,—
Like the young moon that night by night
Shines on with ever waxing light,—
Brave as his royal father, wise
As he who counsels in the skies:(758)
Marked how, forwearied with the quest,
He heeded not his liege’s hest,
But Tára’s every word obeyed
Like Indra still by Śukra(759) swayed.
Then with his prudent speech he tried
To better thoughts the prince to guide,
And by division’s skilful art
The Vánars and the youth to part:
“Illustrious Angad, thou in fight
Hast far surpassed thy father’s might,
Most worthy, like thy sire of old,
The empire of our race to hold.
The Vánars’ fickle people range
From wish to wish and welcome change.
Their wives and babes they will not leave
And to their new-made sovereign cleave.
No art, no gifts will draw away
The Vánars from Sugríva’s sway,
Through hope of wealth, through fear of pain
Still faithful will they all remain.
Thou fondly hopest in this cave
The vengeance of the foe to brave.
But Lakshmaṇ’s arm a shower will send
Of deadly shafts those walls to rend.
Like Indra’s bolts his shafts have power
To cleave the mountain like a flower.
O Angad, mark my counsel well:
If in this cave thou choose to dwell,
These Vánar hosts with one accord
Will quit thee for their lawful lord,
And turn again with thirsty eyes
To wife and babe and all they prize.
Thou in the lonely cavern left
Of followers and friends bereft,
Wilt be in all thy woe, alas,
Weak as a blade of trembling grass:
And Lakshmaṇ’s arrows, keen and fierce
From his strong bow, thy heart will pierce.
But if in lowly reverence meek
Sugríva’s court with us thou seek,
He, as thy birth demands, will share
The kingdom with the royal heir.
Thy loving kinsman, true and wise,
Looks on thee still with favouring eyes.
Firm in his promise, pure is he,
And ne’er will vex or injure thee.
He loves thy mother, lives for her
A faithful friend and worshipper.
That mother’s love thou mayst not spurn:
Her only child, return, return.”
