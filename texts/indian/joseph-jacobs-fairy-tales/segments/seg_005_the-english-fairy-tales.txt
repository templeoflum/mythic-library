MUST NOT READ ANY FURTHER


NOTES AND REFERENCES

In the following notes I give first the _source_ whence I obtained the
various tales. Then come _parallels_ in some fulness for the United
Kingdom, but only a single example for foreign countries, with a
bibliographical reference where further variants can be found. Finally,
a few _remarks_ are sometimes added where the tale seems to need it. In
two cases (Nos. xvi. and xxi.) I have been more full.


I. TOM TIT TOT.

_Source_.--Unearthed by Mr. E. Clodd from the “Suffolk Notes and
Queries” of the _Ipswich Journal_, and reprinted by him in a paper on
“The Philosophy of Rumpelstiltskin” in _Folk-Lore Journal_, vii. 138-43.
I have reduced the Suffolk dialect.

_Parallels_.--In Yorkshire this occurs as “Habetrot and Scantlie Mab,”
 in Henderson's _Folk-Lore of Northern Counties_, 221-6; in Devonshire
as “Duffy and the Devil” in Hunt's _Romances and Drolls of the West
of England_, 239-47; in Scotland two variants are given by Chambers,
_Popular Rhymes of Scotland_, under the title “Whuppity Stourie.” The
“name-guessing wager” is also found in “Peerifool”, printed by Mr.
Andrew Lang in _Longman's Magazine_, July 1889, also _Folk-Lore_,
September, 1890. It is clearly the same as Grimm's “Rumpelstiltskin”
 (No. 14); for other Continental parallels see Mr. Clodd's article, and
Cosquin, _Contes pop. de Lorraine_, i. 269 _seq_.

_Remarks_.--One of the best folk-tales that have ever been collected,
far superior to any of the continental variants of this tale with which
I am acquainted. Mr. Clodd sees in the class of name-guessing stories, a
“survival” of the superstition that to know a man's name gives you power
over him, for which reason savages object to tell their names. It may be
necessary, I find, to explain to the little ones that Tom Tit can only
be referred to as “that,” because his name is not known till the end.


II. THE THREE SILLIES.

_Source_.--From _Folk-Lore Journal_, ii. 40-3; to which it was
communicated by Miss C. Burne.

_Parallels_.--Prof. Stephens gave a variant from his own memory in
_Folk-Lore Record_, iii. 155, as told in Essex at the beginning of the
century. Mr. Toulmin Smith gave another version in _The Constitutional_,
July 1, 1853, which was translated by his daughter, and contributed
to _Mélusine_, t. ii. An Oxfordshire version was given in _Notes and
Queries_, April 17, 1852. It occurs also in Ireland, Kennedy, _Fireside
Stories_, p. 9. It is Grimm's _Kluge Else_, No. 34, and is spread
through the world. Mr. Clouston devotes the seventh chapter of his _Book
of Noodles_ to the Quest of the Three Noodles.


III. THE ROSE TREE.

_Source_.--From the first edition of Henderson's _Folk-Lore of
Northern Counties_, p. 314, to which it was communicated by the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould.

_Parallels_.--This is better known under the title, “Orange and Lemon,”
 and with the refrain:

  “My mother killed me,
  My father picked my bones,
  My little sister buried me,
  Under the marble stones.”

I heard this in Australia. Mr. Jones Gives part of it in _Folk Tales
of the Magyars_, 418-20, and another version occurs in 4 _Notes and
Queries_, vi. 496. Mr. I. Gollancz informs me he remembers a version
entitled “Pepper, Salt, and Mustard,” with the refrain just given.
Abroad it is Grimm's “Juniper Tree” (No. 47), where see further
parallels. The German rhyme is sung by Margaret in the mad scene of
Goethe's “Faust.”


IV. OLD WOMAN AND PIG.

_Source_.--Halliwell's _Nursery Rhymes and Tales_, 114.

_Parallels_.--_Cf._ Miss Burne, _Shropshire Folk-Lore_, 529; also No.
xxxiv. _infra_ (“Cat and Mouse”). It occurs also in Scotch, with the
title “The Wife and her Bush of Berries,” Chambers's _Pop. Rhymes_, p.
57. Newell, _Games and Songs of American Children_, gives a game named
“Club-fist” (No. 75), founded on this, and in his notes refers to
German, Danish, and Spanish variants. (_Cf._ Cosquin, ii. 36 _seq._)

_Remarks_.--One of the class of Accumulative stories, which are well
represented in England. (_Cf. infra_, Nos. xvi., xx., xxxiv.)


V. HOW JACK SOUGHT HIS FORTUNE.

_Source_.--_American Folk-Lore Journal_ I, 227-8. I have eliminated a
malodorous and un-English skunk.

_Parallels_.--Two other versions are given in the _Journal l.c._ One
of these, however, was probably derived from Grimm's “Town Musicians of
Bremen” (No. 27). That the others came from across the Atlantic is shown
by the fact that it occurs in Ireland (Kennedy, _Fictions_, pp. 5-10)
and Scotland (Campbell, No. 11). For other variants, see R. Köhler in
Gonzenbach, _Sicil. Märchen_, ii. 245.


VI. MR. VINEGAR.

_Source_.--Halliwell, p. 149.

_Parallels_.--This is the _Hans im Glück_ of Grimm (No. 83). _Cf._ too,
“Lazy Jack,” _infra_, No. xxvii. Other variants are given by M. Cosquin,
_Contes pop. de Lorraine_, i. 241. On surprising robbers, see preceding
tale.

_Remarks_.--In some of the variants the door is carried, because Mr.
Vinegar, or his equivalent, has been told to “mind the door,” or he acts
on the principle “he that is master of the door is master of the
house.” In other stories he makes the foolish exchanges to the entire
satisfaction of his wife. (_Cf._ Cosquin, i. 156-7.)


VII. NIX NOUGHT NOTHING.

_Source_.--From a Scotch tale, “Nicht Nought Nothing,” collected by Mr.
Andrew Lang in Morayshire, published by him first in _Revue Celtique_,
t. iii; then in his _Custom and Myth_, p. 89; and again in _Folk-Lore_,
Sept. 1890. I have changed the name so as to retain the _équivoque_ of
the giant's reply to the King. I have also inserted the incidents of
the flight, the usual ones in tales of this type, and expanded the
conclusion, which is very curtailed and confused in the original. The
usual ending of tales of this class contains the “sale of bed” incident,
for which see Child, i. 391.

_Parallels_.--Mr. Lang, in the essay “A Far-travelled Tale” in which
he gives the story, mentions several variants of it, including the
classical myth of Jason and Medea. A fuller study in Cosquin, _l.c._,
ii. 12-28. For the finger ladder, see Köhler, in _Orient and Occident_,
ii. III.


VIII. JACK HANNAFORD.

_Source_.--Henderson's _Folk-Lore of Northern Counties_ (first edition),
p. 319. Communicated by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.

_Parallels_.--“Pilgrims from Paradise” are enumerated in Clouston's
_Book of Noodles_, pp. 205, 214-8. See also Cosquin, _l.c._, i. 239.


IX. BINNORIE.

_Source_.--From the ballad of the “Twa Sisters o' Binnorie.” I have used
the longer version in Roberts's _Legendary Ballads_, with one or two
touches from Mr. Allingham's shorter and more powerful variant in
_The Ballad Book_. A tale is the better for length, a ballad for its
curtness.

_Parallels_.--The story is clearly that of Grimm's “Singing Bone” (No.
28), where one brother slays the other and buries him under a bush.
Years after a shepherd passing by finds a bone under the bush, and,
blowing through this, hears the bone denounce the murderer. For numerous
variants in Ballads and Folk Tales, see Prof. Child's _English and
Scotch Ballads_ (ed. 1886), i. 125, 493; iii. 499.


X. MOUSE AND MOUSER.

_Source_.--From memory by Mrs. E. Burne-Jones.

_Parallels_.--A fragment is given in Halliwell, 43; Chambers's _Popular
Rhymes_ has a Scotch version, “The Cattie sits in the Kilnring spinning”
 (p. 53). The surprise at the end, similar to that in Perrault's “Red
Riding Hood,” is a frequent device in English folk tales. (_Cf. infra_,
Nos. xii., xxiv., xxix., xxxiii., xli.)


XI. CAP O' RUSHES.

_Source_.--Discovered by Mr. E. Clodd, in “Suffolk Notes and Queries” of
the _Ipswich Journal_, published by Mr. Lang in _Longinan's Magazine_,
vol. xiii, also in _Folk-Lore_, Sept. 1890.

_Parallels_.--The beginning recalls “King Lear.” For “loving like salt,”
 see the parallels collected by Cosquin, i. 288. The whole story is a
version of the numerous class of Cinderella stories, the particular
variety being the Catskin sub-species analogous to Perrault's _Peau
d'Ane_. “Catskin” was told by Mr. Burchell to the young Primroses in
“The Vicar of Wakefield,'” and has been elaborately studied by the late
H. C. Coote, in _Folk-Lore Record_, iii. 1-25. It is only now extant
in ballad form, of which “Cap o' Rushes” may be regarded as a prose
version.


XII. TEENY-TINY.

_Source_.--Halliwell, 148.


XIII. JACK AND THE BEANSTALK.

_Source_.--I tell this as it was told me in Australia, somewhere about
the year 1860.

_Parallels_.--There is a chap-book version which is very poor; it is
given by Mr. E. S. Hartland, _English Folk and Fairy Tales_ (Camelot
Series), p. 35, _seq._ In this, when Jack arrives at the top of the
Beanstalk, he is met by a fairy, who gravely informs him that the ogre
had stolen all his possessions from Jack's father. The object of this
was to prevent the tale becoming an encouragement to theft! I have had
greater confidence in my young friends, and have deleted the fairy who
did not exist in the tale as told to me. For the Beanstalk elsewhere,
see Ralston, _Russian Folk Tales_, 293-8. Cosquin has some remarks on
magical ascents (i. 14).


XIV. THREE LITTLE PIGS.

_Source_.--Halliwell, p. 16.

_Parallels_.--The only known parallels are one from Venice, Bernoni,
_Trad. Pop._, punt. iii. p. 65, given in Crane, _Italian Popular
Tales_, p. 267, “The Three Goslings;” and a negro tale in _Lippincott's
Magazine_, December, 1877, p. 753 (“Tiny Pig”).

_Remarks_.--As little pigs do not have hair on their chinny chin-chins,
I suspect that they were originally kids, who have. This would bring
the tale close to the Grimms' “Wolf and Seven Little Kids,” (No. 5).
In Steel and Temple's “Lambikin” (_Wide-awake Stories_, p. 71), the
Lambikin gets inside a Drumikin, and so nearly escapes the jackal.


XV. MASTER AND PUPIL

_Source_.--Henderson, _Folk-Lore of Northern Counties_, first edition,
p. 343, communicated by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould. The rhymes on the open
book have been supplied by Mr. Batten, in whose family, if I understand
him rightly, they have been long used for raising the----; something
similar occurs in Halliwell, p. 243, as a riddle rhyme. The mystic signs
in Greek are a familiar “counting-out rhyme”: these have been studied
in a monograph by Mr. H. C. Bolton; he thinks they are “survivals” of
incantations. Under the circumstances, it would be perhaps as well if
the reader did not read the lines out when alone. One never knows what
may happen.

_Parallels_.--Sorcerers' pupils seem to be generally selected for their
stupidity--in folk-tales. Friar Bacon was defrauded of his labour in
producing the Brazen Head in a similar way. In one of the legends about
Virgil he summoned a number of demons, who would have torn him to
pieces if he had not set them at work (J. S. Tunison, _Master Virgil_,
Cincinnati, 1888, p. 30).


XVI. TATTY MOUSE AND TATTY MOUSE.

_Source_.--Halliwell, p. 115.

_Parallels_.--This curious droll is extremely widespread; references
are given in Cosquin, i. 204 _seq._, and Crane, _Italian Popular Tales_,
375-6. As a specimen I may indicate what is implied throughout these
notes by such bibliographical references by drawing up a list of the
variants of this tale noticed by these two authorities, adding one or
two lately printed. Various versions have been discovered in:

ENGLAND: Halliwell, _Nursery Rhymes_, p. 115.

Shetlands).

FRANCE: _Mélusine_, 1877, col. 424; Sebillot, _Contes pop. de la Haute
Bretagne_, No. 55, _Litterature orale_, p. 232; _Magasin picturesque_,
1869, p. 82; Cosquin, _Contes pop. de Lorraine_, Nos. 18 and 74.

ITALY: Pitrè, _Novelline popolari siciliane_, No. 134 (translated in
Crane, _Ital. Pop. Tales_, p. 257); Imbriani, _La novellaja Fiorentina_,
p. 244; Bernoni, _Tradizione popolari veneziane_, punt. iii. p. 81;

the Field_, p. 30, “Death of Chanticleer”).

SPAIN: Maspons, _Cuentos populars catalans_, p. 12; Fernan Caballero,

ROUMANIA: Kremnitz, _Rumänische Mährchen_, No. 15.

ASIA MINOR: Von Hahn, _Griechische und Albanesische Märchen_, No. 56.

INDIA: Steel and Temple, _Wide-awake Stories_, p. 157 (“The Death and
Burial of Poor Hen-Sparrow”).

_Remarks_.--These 25 variants of the same jingle scattered over the
world from India to Spain, present the problem of the diffusion of
folk-tales in its simplest form. No one is likely to contend with Prof.
Müller and Sir George Cox, that we have here the detritus of archaic
Aryan mythology, a parody of a sun-myth. There is little that is savage
and archaic to attract the school of Dr. Tylor, beyond the speaking
powers of animals and inanimates. Yet even Mr. Lang is not likely to
hold that these variants arose by coincidence and independently in the
various parts of the world where they have been found. The only solution
is that the curious succession of incidents was invented once for all at
some definite place and time by some definite entertainer for children,
and spread thence through all the Old World. In a few instances we can
actually trace the passage-_e.g._, the Shetland version was certainly
brought over from Hamburg. Whether the centre of dispersion was India or
not, it is impossible to say, as it might have spread east from Smyrna
(Hahn, No. 56). Benfey (_Einleitung zu Pantschatantra_, i. 190-91)
suggests that this class of accumulative story may be a sort of parody
on the Indian stories, illustrating the moral, “what great events from
small occasions rise.” Thus, a drop of honey falls on the ground; a fly
goes after it, a bird snaps at the fly, a dog goes for the bird, another
dog goes for the first, the masters of the two dogs--who happen to be
kings--quarrel and go to war, whole provinces are devastated, and
all for a drop of honey! “Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse” also ends in
a universal calamity which seems to arise from a cause of no great
importance. Benfey's suggestion is certainly ingenious, but perhaps too
ingenious to be true.


XVII. JACK AND HIS SNUFF-BOX.

_Source_.-Mr. F. Hindes Groome, _In Gipsy Tents_, p. 201 _seq._ I have
eliminated a superfluous Gipsy who makes her appearance towards the
end of the tale _à propos des boltes_, but otherwise have left the tale
unaltered as one of the few English folk-tales that have been taken down
from the mouths of the peasantry: this applies also to i., ii., xi.

_Parallels_.-There is a magic snuff-box with a friendly power in it in
Kennedy's _Fictions of the Irish Celts_, p. 49. The choice between a
small cake with a blessing, &c., is frequent (_cf._ No. xxiii.), but the
closest parallel to the whole story, including the mice, is afforded
by a tale in Carnoy and Nicolaides' _Traditions populaires de l'Asie
Mineure_, which is translated as the first tale in Mr. Lang's _Blue
Fairy Book_. There is much in both that is similar to Aladdin, I beg his
pardon, Allah-ed-din.


XVIII. THE THREE BEARS.

_Source_.--_Verbatim et literatim_ from Southey, _The Doctor, &c._,
quarto edition, p. 327.

_Parallels_.--None, as the story was invented by Southey. There is an
Italian translation, _I tre Orsi_, Turin, 1868, and it would be curious
to see if the tale ever acclimatises itself in Italy.

_Remarks_.--“The Three Bears” is the only example I know of where a
tale that can be definitely traced to a specific author has become a
folk-tale. Not alone is this so, but the folk has developed the tale in
a curious and instructive way, by substituting a pretty little girl with
golden locks for the naughty old woman. In Southey's version there is
nothing of Little Silverhair as the heroine: she seems to have been
introduced in a metrical version by G. N., much be-praised by Southey.
Silverhair seems to have become a favourite, and in Mrs. Valentine's
version of “The Three Bears,” in “The Old, Old Fairy Tales,” the visit
to the bear-house is only the preliminary to a long succession of
adventures of the pretty little girl, of which there is no trace in the
original (and this in “The Old, Old Fairy Tales.” Oh! Mrs. Valentine!).
I have, though somewhat reluctantly, cast back to the original form.
After all, as Prof. Dowden remarks, Southey's memory is kept alive more
by “The Three Bears” than anything else, and the text of such a nursery
classic should be retained in all its purity.


XIX. JACK THE GIANT-KILLER.

_Source_.--From two chap-books at the British Museum (London, 1805,
Paisley, 1814). I have taken some hints from “Felix Summerly's” (Sir
Henry Cole's) version, 1845. From the latter part, I have removed the
incident of the Giant dragging the lady along by her hair.

_Parallels_.--The chap-book of “Jack the Giant-Killer” is a curious
jumble. The second part, as in most chap-books, is a weak and late
invention of the enemy, and is not _volkstümlich_ at all. The first part
is compounded of a comic and a serious theme. The first is that of the
Valiant Tailor (Grimm, No. 20); to this belong the incidents of the
fleabite blows (for variants of which see Köhler in _Jahrb. rom. eng.
Phil._, viii. 252), and that of the slit paunch (_cf._ Cosquin, _l.c._,
ii. 51). The Thankful Dead episode, where the hero is assisted by the
soul of a person whom he has caused to be buried, is found as early
as the _Cento novelle antiche_ and Straparola, xi. 2. It has been best
studied by Köhler in _Germania_, iii. 199-209 (_cf._ Cosquin, i. 214-5;
ii. 14 and note; and Crane, _Ital. Pop. Tales_, 350, note 12). It occurs
also in the curious play of Peele's _The Old Wives' Tale_, in which one
of the characters is the Ghost of Jack. Practically the same story as
this part of Jack the Giant-Killer occurs in Kennedy, _Fictions of the
Irish Celts_, p. 32, “Jack the Master and Jack the Servant;” and Kennedy
adds (p. 38), “In some versions Jack the Servant is the spirit of the
buried man.”

The “Fee-fi-fo-fum” formula is common to all English stories of giants
and ogres; it also occurs in Peele's play and in _King Lear_ (see note
on “Childe Rowland”). Messrs. Jones and Kropf have some remarks on it in
their “Magyar Tales,” pp. 340-1; so has Mr. Lang in his “Perrault,” p.
lxiii., where he traces it to the Furies in Aeschylus' _Eumenides_.


XX. HENNY-PENNY.

_Source_.--I give this as it was told me in Australia in 1860. The fun
consists in the avoidance of all pronouns, which results in jaw-breaking
sentences almost equal to the celebrated “She stood at the door of the
fish-sauce shop, welcoming him in.”

_Parallels_.--Halliwell, p. 151, has the same with the title
“Chicken-Licken.” It occurs also in Chambers's _Popular Rhymes_, p.
59, with the same names of the _dramatis personae_, as my version. For
European parallels, see Crane, _Ital. Pop. Tales_, 377, and authorities
there quoted.


XXI. CHILDE ROWLAND.

_Source_.--Jamieson's _Illustrations of Northern Antiquities_, 1814, p.
397 _seq._, who gives it as told by a tailor in his youth, _c._ 1770. I
have Anglicised the Scotticisms, eliminated an unnecessary ox-herd and
swine-herd, who lose their heads for directing the Childe, and I have
called the Erlkönig's lair the Dark Tower on the strength of the
description and of Shakespeare's reference. I have likewise suggested a
reason why Burd Ellen fell into his power, chiefly in order to introduce
a definition of “widershins.” “All the rest is the original horse,” even
including the erroneous description of the youngest son as the Childe or
heir (_cf._ “Childe Harold” and Childe Wynd, _infra_, No. xxxiii.),
unless this is some “survival” of Junior Right or “Borough English,” the
archaic custom of letting the heirship pass to the youngest son. I
should add that, on the strength of the reference to Merlin, Jamieson
calls Childe Rowland's mother, Queen Guinevere, and introduces
references to King Arthur and his Court. But as he confesses that these
are his own improvements on the tailor's narrative I have eliminated
them.

_Parallels_.--The search for the Dark Tower is similar to that of the
Red Ettin, (_cf_. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 222). The formula “youngest
best,” in which the youngest of three brothers succeeds after the
others have failed, is one of the most familiar in folk-tales amusingly
parodied by Mr. Lang in his _Prince Prigio_. The taboo against taking
food in the underworld occurs in the myth of Proserpine, and is also
frequent in folk-tales (Child, i. 322). But the folk-tale parallels
to our tale fade into insignificance before its brilliant literary
relationships. There can be little doubt that Edgar, in his mad scene in
_King Lear_, is alluding to our tale when he breaks into the lines:

“Childe Rowland to the Dark Tower came....” His word was still: “Fie,
foh and fum, I smell the blood of a British man.” _King Lear_, act iii.
sc. 4, _ad fin_.

[Footnote: “British” for “English.” This is one of the points that
settles the date of the play; James I. was declared King of Great
_Britain_, October 1604. I may add that Motherwell in his _Minstrelsy_,
p. xiv. note, testifies that the story was still extant in the nursery
at the time he wrote (1828).]

The latter reference is to the cry of the King of Elfland. That some
such story was current in England in Shakespeare's time, is proved by
that curious _mélange_ of nursery tales, Peele's _The Old Wives' Tale_.
The main plot of this is the search of two brothers, Calypha and
Thelea, for a lost sister, Delia, who has been bespelled by a sorcerer,
Sacrapant (the names are taken from the “Orlando Furioso”). They are
instructed by an old man (like Merlin in “Childe Rowland”) how to rescue
their sister, and ultimately succeed. The play has besides this the
themes of the Thankful Dead, the Three Heads of the Well (which see),
the Life Index, and a transformation, so that it is not to be wondered
at if some of the traits of “Childe Rowland” are observed in it.

But a still closer parallel is afforded by Milton's _Comus_. Here again
we have two brothers in search of a sister, who has got into the power
of an enchanter. But besides this, there is the refusal of the heroine
to touch the enchanted food, just as Childe Rowland finally refuses.
And ultimately the bespelled heroine is liberated by a liquid, which is
applied to her _lips and finger-tips_, just as Childe Rowland's brothers
are unspelled. Such a minute resemblance as this cannot be accidental,
and it is therefore probable that Milton used the original form of
“Childe Rowland,” or some variant of it, as heard in his youth, and
adapted it to the purposes of the masque at Ludlow Castle, and of
his allegory. Certainly no other folk-tale in the world can claim so
distinguished an offspring.

_Remarks_.--Distinguished as “Childe Rowland” will be henceforth as
the origin of _Comus_, if my affiliation be accepted, it has even
more remarkable points of interest, both in form and matter, for the
folklorist, unless I am much mistaken. I will therefore touch upon these
points, reserving a more detailed examination for another occasion.

First, as to the form of the narrative. This begins with verse, then
turns to prose, and throughout drops again at intervals into poetry in a
friendly way like Mr. Wegg. Now this is a form of writing not unknown in
other branches of literature, the _cante-fable_, of which “Aucassin et
Nicolette” is the most distinguished example. Nor is the _cante-fable_
confined to France. Many of the heroic verses of the Arabs contained
in the _Hamâsa_ would be unintelligible without accompanying narrative,
which is nowadays preserved in the commentary. The verses imbedded
in the _Arabian Nights_ give them something of the character of a
_cante-fable_, and the same may be said of the Indian and Persian
story-books, though the verse is usually of a sententious and moral
kind, as in the _gâthas_ of the Buddhist Jatakas. Even as remote as
Zanzibar, Mr. Lang notes, the folk-tales are told as _cante-fables_.
There are even traces in the Old Testament of such screeds of verse amid
the prose narrative, as in the story of Lamech or that of Balaam. All
this suggests that this is a very early and common form of narrative.

Among folk-tales there are still many traces of the _cante-fable_. Thus,
in Grimm's collection, verses occur in Nos. 1, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19,
21, 24, 28, 30, 36, 38_a_, _b_, 39_a_, 40, 45, 46, 47, out of the first
fifty tales, 36 per cent. Of Chambers' twenty-one folk-tales, in the
_Popular Rhymes of Scotland_ only five are without interspersed verses.
Of the forty-three tales contained in this volume, three (ix., xxix.,
xxxiii.) are derived from ballads and do not therefore count in the
present connection. Of the remaining forty, i., iii., vii., xvi., xix.,
xxi., xxiii., xxv., xxxi., xxxv., xxxviii., xli. (made up from verses),
xliii., contain rhymed lines, while xiv., xxii., xxvi., and xxxvii.,
contain “survivals” of rhymes (“let me come in--chinny chin-chin”; “once
again ... come to Spain;” “it is not so--should be so”; “and his lady,
him behind”); and x. and xxxii. are rhythmical if not rhyming. As most
of the remainder are drolls, which have probably a different origin,
there seems to be great probability that originally all folk-tales of a
serious character were interspersed with rhyme, and took therefore the
form of the _cante-fable_. It is indeed unlikely that the ballad
itself began as continuous verse, and the _cante-fable_ is probably
the protoplasm out of which both ballad and folk-tale have been
differentiated, the ballad by omitting the narrative prose, the
folk-tale by expanding it. In “Childe Rowland” we have the nearest
example to such protoplasm, and it is not difficult to see how it could
have been shortened into a ballad or reduced to a prose folk-tale pure
and simple.

The subject-matter of “Childe Rowland” has also claims on our attention
especially with regard to recent views on the true nature and origin of
elves, trolls, and fairies. I refer to the recently published work of
Mr. D. MacRitchie, “The Testimony of Tradition” (Kegan Paul, Trench,
Trübner & Co.)--_i.e._, of tradition about the fairies and the rest.
Briefly put, Mr. MacRitchie's view is that the elves, trolls, and
fairies represented in popular tradition are really the mound-dwellers,
whose remains have been discovered in some abundance in the form of
green hillocks, which have been artificially raised over a long and low
passage leading to a central chamber open to the sky. Mr. MacRitchie
shows that in several instances traditions about trolls or “good
people” have attached themselves to mounds, which have afterwards on
investigation turned out to be evidently the former residence of men of
smaller build than the mortals of to-day. He goes on further to identify
these with the Picts--fairies are called “Pechs” in Scotland--and other
early races, but with these ethnological equations we need not much
concern ourselves. It is otherwise with the mound-traditions and their
relation, if not to fairy tales in general, to tales _about_ fairies,
trolls, elves, etc. These are very few in number, and generally bear the
character of anecdotes. The fairies, etc., steal a child, they help
a wanderer to a drink and then disappear into a green hill, they help
cottagers with their work at night but disappear if their presence is
noticed; human midwives are asked to help fairy mothers, fairy maidens
marry ordinary men or girls marry and live with fairy husbands. All
such things may have happened and bear no such _à priori_ marks of
impossibility as speaking animals, flying through the air, and similar
incidents of the folk-tale pure and simple. If, as archaeologists tell
us, there was once a race of men in Northern Europe, very short and
hairy, that dwelt in underground chambers artificially concealed by
green hillocks, it does not seem unlikely that odd survivors of the
race should have lived on after they had been conquered and nearly
exterminated by Aryan invaders and should occasionally have performed
something like the pranks told of fairies and trolls.

Certainly the description of the Dark Tower of the King of Elfland in
“Childe Rowland,” has a remarkable resemblance to the dwellings of the
“good folk,” which recent excavations have revealed. By the kindness of
Mr. MacRitchie, I am enabled to give the reader illustrations of one of
the most interesting of these, the Maes-How of Orkney. This is a green
mound some 100 feet in length and 35 in breadth at its broadest part.
Tradition had long located a goblin in its centre, but it was not till
1861 that it was discovered to be pierced by a long passage 53 feet in
length, and only two feet four inches high, for half of its length. This
led into a central chamber 15 feet square and open to the sky.

Now it is remarkable how accurately all this corresponds to the Dark
Tower of “Childe Rowland,” allowing for a little idealisation on the
part of the narrator. We have the long dark passage leading into the
well-lit central chamber, and all enclosed in a green hill or mound.
It is of course curious to contrast Mr. Batten's frontispiece with the
central chamber of the How, but the essential features are the same.
Even such a minute touch as the terraces on the hill have their bearing,
I believe, on Mr. MacRitchie's “realistic” views of Faerie. For in quite
another connection Mr. G. L. Gomme, in his recent “Village Community”
 (W. Scott), pp. 75-98, has given reasons and examples for believing
that terrace cultivation along the sides of hills was a practice of the
non-Aryan and pre-Aryan inhabitants of these isles. [Footnote: To these
may be added Iona (_cf._ Duke of Argyll, _Iona_, p. 109).] Here then
from a quarter quite unexpected by Mr. MacRitchie, we have evidence
of the association of the King of Elfland with a non-Aryan mode of
cultivation of the soil. By Mr. Gomme's kindness I am enabled to give an
illustration of this.

Altogether it seems not improbable that in such a tale as “Childe
Rowland” we have an idealised picture of a “marriage by capture” of one
of the diminutive non-Aryan dwellers of the green hills with an Aryan
maiden, and her re-capture by her brothers. It is otherwise difficult to
account for such a circumstantial description of the interior of these
mounds, and especially of such a detail as the terrace cultivation on
them. At the same time it must not be thought that Mr. MacRitchie's
views explain all fairy tales, or that his identifications of Finns
= Fenians = Fairies = Sidhe = “Pechs” = Picts, will necessarily be
accepted. His interesting book, so far as it goes, seems to throw light
on tales about mermaids (Finnish women in their “kayaks,”) and trolls,
but not necessarily, on fairy tales in general. Thus, in the present
volume, besides “Childe Rowland,” there is only “Tom Tit Tot” in his
hollow, the green hill in “Kate Crackernuts,” the “Cauld Lad of Hilton,”
 and perhaps the “Fairy Ointment,” that are affected by his views.

Finally, there are a couple of words in the narrative that deserve a
couple of words of explanation: “Widershins” is probably, as Mr. Batten
suggests, analogous to the German “wider Schein,” against the appearance
of the sun, “counter-clockwise” as the mathematicians say--_i.e._, W.,
S., E., N., instead of with the sun and the hands of a clock; why
it should have an unspelling influence is hard to say. “Bogle” is a
provincial word for “spectre,” and is analogous to the Welsh _bwg_,
“goblin,” and to the English insect of similar name, and still more
curiously to the Russian “Bog,” God, after which so many Russian rivers
are named. I may add that “Burd” is etymologically the same as “bride”
 and is frequently used in the early romances for “Lady.”


XXII. MOLLY WHUPPIE.

_Source_.--_Folk-Lore Journal_, ii. p. 68, forwarded by Rev. Walter
Gregor. I have modified the dialect and changed “Mally” into “Molly.”

_Parallels_.--The first part is clearly the theme of “Hop o' my Thumb,”
 which Mr. Lang has studied in his “Perrault,” pp. civ.-cxi. (_cf._
Köhler, _Occident_, ii. 301.) The change of night-dresses occurs in
Greek myths. The latter part wanders off into “rob giant of three
things,” a familiar incident in folk-tales (Cosquin, i. 46-7), and
finally winds up with the “out of sack” trick, for which see Cosquin,
i. 113; ii. 209; and Köhler on Campbell, in _Occident and Orient_, ii.
489-506.


XXIII. RED ETTIN.

_Source_.--“The Red Etin” in Chambers's _Pop. Rhymes of Scotland_, p.
89. I have reduced the adventurers from three to two, and cut down
the herds and their answers. I have substituted riddles from the first
English collection of riddles, _The Demandes Joyous_ of Wynkyn de Worde,
for the poor ones of the original, which are besides not solved. “Ettin”
 is the English spelling of the word, as it is thus spelt in a passage
of Beaumont and Fletcher (_Knight of Burning Pestle_, i. 1), which may
refer to this very story, which, as we shall see, is quite as old as
their time.

_Parallels_.--“The Red Etin” is referred to in _The Complaynt of
Scotland_, about 1548. It has some resemblance to “Childe Rowland,”
 which see. The “death index,” as we may call tokens that tell the state
of health of a parted partner, is a usual incident in the theme of the
Two Brothers, and has been studied by the Grimms, i. 421, 453; ii. 403;
by Köhler on Campbell, _Occ. u. Or._, ii. 119-20; on Gonzenbach, ii.
230; on Bladé, 248; by Cosquin, _l.c._, i. 70-2, 193; by Crane, _Ital.
Pop. Tales_, 326; and by Jones and Kropf, _Magyar Tales_, 329. Riddles
generally come in the form of the “riddle-bride-wager” (_cf._ Child,
_Ballads_, i. 415-9; ii. 519), when the hero or heroine wins a spouse by
guessing a riddle or riddles. Here it is the simpler Sphinx form of the
“riddle task,” on which see Köhler in _Jahrb. rom. Phil._, vii. 273, and
on Gonzenbach, 215.


XXIV. GOLDEN ARM.

_Source_.--Henderson, _l.c._, p. 338, collected by the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould, in Devonshire. Mr. Burne-Jones remembers hearing it in his
youth in Warwickshire.

_Parallels_.--The first fragment at the end of Grimm (ii. 467, of Mrs.
Hunt's translation), tells of an innkeeper's wife who had used the liver
of a man hanging on the gallows, whose ghost comes to her and tells her
what has become of his hair, and his eyes, and the dialogue concludes

  “SHE: Where is thy liver?
  IT: Thou hast devoured it!”

For similar “surprise packets” see Cosquin, ii. 77.

_Remarks_.--It is doubtful how far such gruesome topics should be
introduced into a book for children, but as a matter of fact the
_katharsis_ of pity and terror among the little ones is as effective as
among the spectators of a drama, and they take the same kind of pleasant
thrill from such stories. They know it is all make-believe just as much
as the spectators of a tragedy. Every one who has enjoyed the blessing
of a romantic imagination has been trained up on such tales of wonder.


XXV. TOM THUMB.

_Source_.--From the chap-book contained in Halliwell, p. 199, and Mr.
Hartland's _English Folk and Fairy Tales_. I have omitted much of the
second part.

_Parallels_.--Halliwell has also a version entirely in verse. “Tom
Thumb” is “Le petit Poucet” of the French, “Daumling” of the Germans,
and similar diminutive heroes elsewhere (_cf._ Deulin, _Contes de ma
Mère l'Oye_, 326), but of his adventures only that in the cow's stomach
(_cf._ Cosquin, ii. 190) is common with his French and German cousins.
M. Gaston Paris has a monograph on “Tom Thumb.”


XXVI. MR. FOX.

_Source_.--Contributed by Blakeway to Malone's Variorum Shakespeare, to
illustrate Benedick's remark in _Much Ado about Nothing_ (I. i. 146):
“Like the old tale, my Lord, 'It is not so, nor 'twas not so, but,
indeed, God forbid it should be so;'” which clearly refers to the tale
of Mr. Fox. “The Forbidden Chamber” has been studied by Mr. Hartland,
_Folk-Lore Journal_, iii. 193, _seq._

_Parallels_.--Halliwell, p. 166, gives a similar tale of “An Oxford
Student,” whose sweetheart saw him digging her grave. “Mr. Fox” is
clearly a variant of the theme of “The Robber Bridegroom” (Grimm, No.
40, Mrs. Hunt's translation, i. 389, 395; and Cosquin, i. 180-1).


XXVII. LAZY JACK.

_Source_.--Halliwell, 157.

_Parallels_.--The same story occurs in Lowland Scotch as “Jock and
his Mother,” Chambers, _l.c._, 101; in Ireland, as “I'll be wiser next
time,” Kennedy, _l.c._, 39-42. Abroad it is Grimm's _Hans im Glück_
(No. 83). The “cure by laughing” incident is “common form” in folk-tales
(_cf._ Köhler on Gonzenbach, _Sizil. Märchen_, ii. 210, 224; Jones and
Kropf, _Magyar Tales_, 312).


XXVIII. JOHNNY-CAKE.

_Source_.--_American Journal of Folk-Lore_, ii. 60.

_Parallels_.--Another variant is given in the same _Journal_, p. 277,
where reference is also made to a version “The Gingerbread Boy,” in
_St. Nicholas_, May 1875. Chambers gives two versions of the same story,
under the title “The Wee Bunnock,” the first of which is one of the most
dramatic and humorous of folk-tales. Unfortunately, the Scotticisms are
so frequent as to render the droll practically untranslatable. “The Fate
of Mr. Jack Sparrow” in _Uncle Remus_ is similar to that of Johnny-Cake.


XXIX. EARL MAR'S DAUGHTER.

_Source_.--From the ballad of the same name as given in Mr. Allingham's
_Ballad Book_: it is clearly a fairy tale and not a ballad proper.

_Parallels_.--The lover visiting his spouse in guise of a bird, is a
frequent _motif_ in folk-tales.


XXX. MR. MIACCA.

_Source_.--From memory of Mrs. B. Abrahams, who heard it from her mother
some _x_ years ago (more than 40). I have transposed the two incidents,
as in her version Tommy Grimes was a clever carver and carried about
with him a carven leg. This seemed to me to exceed the limits of
_vraisemblance_ even for a folk-tale.

_Parallels_.--Getting out of an ogre's clutches by playing on the
simplicity of his wife, occurs in “Molly Whuppie” (No. xxii.), and its
similars. In the Grimms' “Hansel and Grethel,” Hansel pokes out a stick
instead of his finger that the witch may not think him fat enough for
the table.

_Remarks_.--Mr. Miacca seems to have played the double _rôle_ of a
domestic Providence. He not alone punished bad boys, as here, but also
rewarded the good, by leaving them gifts on appropriate occasions like
Santa Claus or Father Christmas, who, as is well known, only leave
things for good children. Mrs. Abrahams remembers one occasion well
when she nearly caught sight of Mr. Miacca, just after he had left her a
gift; she saw his shadow in the shape of a bright light passing down the
garden.


XXXI. DICK WHITTINGTON.

_Source_.--I have cobbled this up out of three chap-book versions; (1)
that contained in Mr. Hartland's _English Folk-tales_; (2) that edited
by Mr. H. B. Wheatley for the Villon Society; (3) that appended to
Messrs. Besant and Rice's monograph.

_Parallels_.--Whittington's cat has made the fortune of his master in
all parts of the Old World, as Mr. W. A. Clouston, among others,
has shown, _Popular Tales and Fictions_, ii. 65-78 (_cf._ Köhler on
Gonzenbach, ii. 251).

_Remarks_.--If Bow Bells had pealed in the exact and accurate nineteenth
century, they doubtless would have chimed

  Turn again, Whittington,
  Thrice and a half Lord Mayor of London.

For besides his three mayoralties of 1397, 1406, and 1419, he served as
Lord Mayor in place of Adam Bamme, deceased, in the latter half of
the mayoralty of 1396. It will be noticed that the chap-book puts the
introduction of potatoes rather far back.


XXXII. THE STRANGE VISITOR

_Source_.--From Chambers, _l.c._, 64, much Anglicised. I have retained
“Aih-late-wee-moul,” though I candidly confess I have not the slightest
idea what it means; judging other children by myself, I do not
think that makes the response less effective. The prosaic-minded may
substitute “Up-late-and-little-food.”

_Parallels_.--The man made by instalments, occurs in the Grimms' No. 4,
and something like it in an English folk-tale, _The Golden Ball_, _ap._
Henderson, _l.c._, p. 333.


XXXIII. THE LAIDLY WORM.

_Source_.--From an eighteenth-century ballad of the Rev. Mr. Lamb of
Norham, as given in Prof. Child's _Ballads_; with a few touches and
verses from the more ancient version “Kempion.” A florid prose version
appeared in _Monthly Chronicle of North Country Lore_ for May 1890. I
have made the obvious emendation of

O quit your sword, unbend your bow

for

O quit your sword, and bend your bow.

_Parallels_.--The ballad of “Kempe Owein” is a more general version
which “The Laidly Worm” has localised near Bamborough. We learn from
this that the original hero was Kempe or Champion Owain, the Welsh hero
who flourished in the ninth century. Childe Wynd therefore = Childe
Owein. The “Deliverance Kiss” has been studied by Prof. Child, _l.c._,
i. 207. A noteworthy example occurs in Boiardo's _Orlando Inamorato_,
cc. xxv., xxvi.

_Remarks_.--It is perhaps unnecessary to give the equations “Laidly Worm
= Loathly Worm = Loathsome Dragon,” and “borrowed = changed.”


XXXIV. CAT AND MOUSE.

_Source_.--Halliwell, p. 154.

_Parallels_.--Scarcely more than a variant of the “Old Woman and her
Pig” (No. iv.), which see. It is curious that a very similar “run” is
added by Bengali women at the end of every folk-tale they tell (Lal
Behari Day, _Folk Tales of Bengal_, Pref. _ad fin._)


XXXV. THE FISH AND THE RING.

_Source_.--Henderson, _l.c._, p. 326, from a communication by the Rev.
S. Baring-Gould.

_Parallels_.--“Jonah rings” have been put together by Mr. Clouston
in his _Popular Tales_, i. 398, &c.: the most famous are those of
Polycrates, of Solomon, and the Sanskrit drama of “Sakuntala,” the plot
of which turns upon such a ring. “Letters to kill bearer” have been
traced from Homer downwards by Prof. Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 220, and
“the substituted letter” by the same authority in _Occ. u. Or._, ii.
289. Mr. Baring-Gould, who was one of the pioneers of the study of
folk-tales in this country, has given a large number of instances of
“the pre-ordained marriage” in folk-tales in Henderson, _l.c._


XXXVI. THE MAGPIE'S NEST.

_Source_.--I have built up the “Magpie's Nest” from two nidification
myths, as a German professor would call them, in the Rev. Mr.
Swainson's _Folk-Lore of British Birds_, pp. 80 and 166. I have received
instruction about the relative values of nests from a little friend of
mine named Katie, who knows all about it. If there is any mistake in
the order of neatness in the various birds' nests, I must have learnt my
lesson badly.

_Remarks_.--English popular tradition is curiously at variance about the
magpie's nidificatory powers, for another legend given by Mr. Swainson
represents her as refusing to be instructed by the birds and that is why
she does _not_ make a good nest.


XXXVII. KATE CRACKERNUTS.

_Source_.--Given by Mr. Lang in _Longman's Magazine_, vol. xiv. and
reprinted in _Folk-Lore_, Sept. 1890. It is very corrupt, both girls
being called Kate, and I have had largely to rewrite.

_Parallels_.--There is a tale which is clearly a cousin if not a parent
of this in _Kennedy's Fictions_, 54 _seq._, containing the visit to the
green hill (for which see “Childe Rowland”), a reference to nuts,
and even the sesame rhyme. The prince is here a corpse who becomes
revivified; the same story is in Campbell No. 13. The jealous stepmother
is “universally human.” (_Cf._ Köhler on Gonzenbach, ii. 206.)


XXXVIII. THE CAULD LAD OF HILTON.

_Source_.--Henderson's _Folk-Lore of Northern Counties_, 2nd edition,
published by the Folk-Lore Society, pp. 266-7. I have written the
introductory paragraph so as to convey some information about Brownies,
Bogles, and Redcaps, for which Henderson, _l.c._, 246-53, is my
authority. Mr. Batten's portrait renders this somewhat superfluous.

_Parallels_.--The Grimms' “Elves” (No. 39) behave in like manner
on being rewarded for their services. Milton's “lubbar-fiend” in
_L'Allegro_ has all the characteristics of a Brownie.


XXXIX. ASS, TABLE AND STICK.

_Source_.--Henderson, _l.c._, first edition, pp. 327-9, by the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould.

_Parallels_.--Mr. Baring-Gould gives another version from the East
Riding, _l.c._, 329, in which there are three brothers who go through
the adventures. He also refers to European Variants, p. 311, which could
now be largely supplemented from Cosquin, i. 53-4, ii. 66, 171.

_Remarks_.--As an example of the sun-myth explanation of folk-tales I
will quote the same authority (p. 314): “The Master, who gives the three
precious gifts, is the All Father, the Supreme Spirit. The gold and
jewel-dropping ass, is the spring cloud, hanging in the sky and shedding
the bright productive vernal showers. The table which covers itself is
the earth becoming covered with flowers and fruit at the bidding of
the New Year. But there is a check; rain is withheld, the process
of vegetation is stayed by some evil influence. Then comes the
thunder-cloud, out of which leaps the bolt; the rains pour down, the
earth receives them, and is covered with abundance--all that was lost is
recovered.”

Mr. Baring-Gould, it is well-known, has since become a distinguished
writer of fiction.


XL. FAIRY OINTMENT.

_Source_.--Mrs. Bray, _The Tamar and the Tavy_, i. 174 (letters to
Southey), as quoted by Mr. Hartland in _Folk-Lore_, i. 207-8. I have
christened the anonymous midwife and euphemised her profession.

_Parallels_.--Mr. Hartland has studied Human Midwives in the _Archaeol.
Review_, iv., and parallels to our story in _Folk-Lore_, i. 209, _seq._;
the most interesting of these is from Gervase of Tilbury (xiii. cent.),
_Otia Imper._, iii. 85, and three Breton tales given by M. Sebillot
(_Contes_, ii. 42; _Litt. orale_, 23; _Trad. et Superst._, i. 109).
_Cf._ Prof. Child, i. 339; ii. 505.


XLI. THE WELL OF THE WORLD'S END.

_Source_.--Leyden's edition of _The Complaynt of Scotland_, p. 234
_seq._, with additional touches from Halliwell, 162-3, who makes up a
slightly different version from the rhymes. The opening formula I have
taken from Mayhew, _London Labour_, iii. 390, who gives it as the usual
one when tramps tell folk-tales. I also added it to No. xvii.

_Parallels_.--Sir W. Scott remembered a similar story; see Taylor's
_Gammer Grethel, ad fin_. In Scotland it is Chambers's tale of _The
Paddo_, p. 87; Leyden supposes it is referred to in the _Complaynt_, (c.
1548), as “The Wolf of the Warldis End.” The well of this name occurs
also in the Scotch version of the “Three Heads of the Well,” (No.
xliii.). Abroad it is the Grimms' first tale, while frogs who would
a-wooing go are discussed by Prof. Köhler, _Occ. u. Orient_ ii. 330; by
Prof. Child, i. 298; and by Messrs. Jones and Kropf, _l.c._, p. 404. The
sieve-bucket task is widespread from the Danaids of the Greeks to the
leverets of _Uncle Remus_, who, curiously enough, use the same rhyme:
“Fill it wid moss en dob it wid clay.” _Cf._, too, No. xxiii.


XLII. MASTER OF ALL MASTERS.

_Source_.--I have taken what suited me from a number of sources, which
shows how wide-spread this quaint droll is in England: (i) In Mayhew,
_London Poor_, iii. 391, told by a lad in a workhouse; (ii) several
versions in 7 _Notes and Queries_, iii. 35, 87, 159, 398.

_Parallels_.--Rev. W. Gregor gives a Scotch version under the title “The
Clever Apprentice,” in _Folk-Lore Journal_, vii. 166. Mr. Hartland, in
_Notes and Queries_, _l.c._, 87, refers to Pitré's _Fiabi sicil._, iii.
120, for a variant.

_Remarks_.--According to Mr. Hartland, the story is designed as a satire
on pedantry, and is as old in Italy as Straparola (sixteenth century).
In passionate Sicily a wife disgusted with her husband's pedantry
sets the house on fire, and informs her husband of the fact in this
unintelligible gibberish; he, not understanding his own lingo, falls
a victim to the flames, and she marries the servant who had taken the
message.


XLIII. THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL.

_Source_.--Halliwell, p. 158. The second wish has been somewhat
euphemised.

_Parallels_.--The story forms part of Peele's _Old Wives' Tale_, where
the rhyme was

  _A Head rises in the well_,
  Fair maiden, white and red,
  Stroke me smooth and comb my head,
  And thou shalt have some cockell-bread.

It is also in Chambers, _l.c._, 105, where the well is at the World's
End (_cf._ No. xli.). The contrasted fates of two step-sisters, is the
Frau Holle (Grimm, No. 24) type of Folk-tale studied by Cosquin, i. 250,
_seq._ “Kate Crackernuts” (No. xxxvii.) is a pleasant contrast to this.
