story ofthereception theyhadhad.
Now itchanced [378] that thisborder merchant despatched another caravan
oflivehundred carts toSavatthi ;and hispeople came with apresent intheir
hands towaitupon Anatha-pindika. But, assoon asAnatha-pindika's people
caught sight ofthem, they said,"Oh, we'll see, sir,thatthey arepropeiiy lodged,
fed,andsupplied withmoney foi-their needs." Andthey took thestrangers
outside thecityandbadethem imyoke their carts atasuitable spot, adding
that riceandadouceur would come from Anatha-pindika's house. About the
middle watch ofthenight, having collected aband ofserving-men and slaves,
they looted thewhole caravan, carried offevery garment themenhad got,
drove away their oxen, andtook thewheels offthe carts, leaving thelatter
butremoving thewheels. Without somuch asashirtamong thelotofthem,
the terrified stivmgers s})edaway andmanaged toreach theirhome onthe
border. Then Anatha-pindika's jjeople toldhimthewhole story. "This capital
story," said he,"shall bemygifttotheMaster to-day;" andaway hewentand
told ittotheMastei*.
"This isnotthe first time, sir,"saidtheMaster, "that thisborder merchant
hasshewn thisdisposition; hewasjustthesame indaysgone by." Then, at
Anatha-pindika's request, hetoldthefollowing story ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahniadatta wasreigning inBenai"es, the
Bodhisatta wasaverywealthy merchant inthat city.Andhetoohadas

Being toldbyhispeople what theyhaddone, hesaid, "This trouble
istheresult oftheir ingratitude forkindness shewn them." Andhewent
ontoinstruct theassembled crowd inthisstanza:—
Theman ungrateful forakindly deed,
Thenceforth shall findnohelper inhisneed.
After thiswise didtheBodhisatta teach thetruth inthis stanza. After
alifespent incharity andother good works, hepassed away tofare

"He bolts thedie."—This story was toldbythe IVIaster while atJetavana,
about using things thoughtlessly.
Tradition says thatmost oftheBrethren ofthatdaywere inthehabit of
using robesandsoforth, which were given them, inathoughtless manner. And
their thoughtless useoftheFour Requisites asarulebarred their escape from
thedoom ofre-birth inhellandtheanimal world. Knowing this,theMaster set
forth thelessons ofvirtue andsliewed thedanger ofsuch thoughtless useof
things, exhorting them tobecareful intheuseoftheFour Requisites, and
laying down this rule,"The thoughtful Brother hasadefinite object inview
when hewears arobe, namely,, tokeep offthecold." After laying down similar
rules fortheother Requisites, heconcluded bysaying, "Such isthethoughtful
usewhich should Ijemade oftheFour Requisites. Thoughtlessly tousethem
isliketaking deadly poison ;andthere were those inbygone dayswhothrough
their thoughtlessness didinadvertently "take poison, totheir exceeding hurt in
dueseason." Sosaying hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into awell-to-do family, andwhen hegrew up,he
became adice-player. With himused toplay asharper, whokept on
playing while hewaswinning, but,when luck turned, broke upthegame
byputting oneofthedice inhismouth andpretending itwas lost,—after
which hewould takehimself off. ['^'"^O]"Very good," saidtheBodhisatta

when herealised what wasbeing done; "we'll look into this." Sohe
tooksome dice, anointed them athome with poison, dried them carefully,
andthen carried them withhim tothesharper, whom hechallenged toa
game. The other was willing, thedice-board wasgotready, andplay
began. Nosooner didthesharper begin tolosethan hepopped oneof
thedice into hismouth. Observing him inthe act,theBodhisatta
remai'ked, "Swallow away; you willnot failtofindoutwhat itreally is
inalittle time." Andheuttered thisstanza ofrebuke :
Hebolts thediequite boldly,—knowing not
What bm'uing poison thereon lurks unseen.—Aye, bolt it,sharper! Soon you'll burn within.
Butwhile theBodhisatta wastalking away, thejjoison began towork on
thesharper ;hegrew faint, rolled hiseyes,andbending double with pain
felltotheground. "Now," saidtheBodhisatta, "Imust savetherascal's
life." Sohemixed some simples andadministered anemetic until
vomiting ensued. Then headministered adiaught ofghee withhoney
andsugar andother ingredients, andbythismeans made thefellow all
right again. Then heexhorted himnottodosuch athing again. After
alifespent incharity andother good woi'ks, theBodhisatta passed away
tofarethereafter according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "Brethren, thethoughtless useofthings
islikethethoughtless taking ofdeadly poison." Sosaying, heidentified the
Birth inthese words, "Iwasmyself thewiseandgoodgambler ofthose days."

"Forwarmen crave."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about thevenerable Ananda.
Once thewives oftheKing ofKosala thought among themselves, asfollows,
"Very rare isthecoming ofaBuddha ;andveryrare isbirth inahuman formwith
allone's faculties inperfection. Yet,though wehavehappened onahuman
form inaPaiddha's lifetime, wecannot goatwilltotheMonastery tohear the

live hei'e asinabox. lietusasktheKing tosend forafitting Brother to
come hereandteach usthetruth. Letuslearn whatwecanfrom him,and
becharitable anddogood works, totheendthatwemay profit byourhaving
beenborn atthishai)py juncture." Sothey allwent inabody totheKing, and
toldhimwhatwasintheirminds ;andtheKing gave hisconsent.
Now itfelloutonadaythat theKing wasminded totake hispleasure in
theroyal pleasaunce, andgave orders that thegrounds should bemade ready
forhiscoming. Asthegardener wasworking away, heespied theIMaster seated
atthefoot ofatree. Sohewent totheKing and said,"The pleasaunce is
made ready, sire ;buttheBlessed One issitting there atthefoot ofatree."
"Very good," saidtheKing,"we willgoandhear theMaster." Mounting his
chariot ofstate, hewent totheMaster inthepleasaunce.
Now there wasthen .seated attheMaster's feet, listening tohisteaching,
alay-brother named Chattapani, whohad entered theThird Path. On
cjitching sight ofthis lay-brother, theKing hesitated ;but,onreflection that
thismust beavirtuous man, orhewould notbesitting bytheMaster for
instruction, heapproached andwith abow seated himself ononeside ofthe
Master. OutofI'everence forthesupreme Buddha, thelay-brother neither rose
intheKing's honour norsaluted hismajesty; and thismade theKing very
angry. Noticing theKing's displeasure, theMaster proceeded toextol the
merits ofthat lay-brother, saying, "Sire, this lay-brother ismaster ofall
tradition;heknows byheart thescriptures thathave beenhanded down ;and
hehassethimself freefrom tliebondage ofpassion." "Surely," thought the
King, "liewhose praises theMaster istelling canbenoordinary person."
Andhesaid tohim,"Letmeknow, lay-brother, ifyouareinneed ofanything."
"Thank you," saidtheman. Then theKing listened totheMaster's teaching,
andatitsclose roseupandceremoniously withdrew.
Another day,meeting thatsame lay-brother going after breakfast umbrella
inhand toJetavana, theKing hadhimsummoned tohispresence and said,
"Ihear, lay-brother, thatyouareaman ofgreat learning. Nowmywives are
veryanxious tohearandlearn thetruth ;Ishould beglad ifyouwould teach
them." "It isnotmeet, sire,that alayman [382] should expound orteach the
truth intheKing's harem;that istheprerogative oftheBrethren."
Recognising theforce ofthisremark, theKing, after dismissing thelayman,
called hiswives together andannounced tothem hisintention ofsending tothe
Master foroneoftheBrethren tocome astheir instructor inthedoctrine. Which
oftheeighty chief disciples would theyhave ?After talking itover together,
theladies with oneaccord chose Ananda^ theElder, surnamed theTreasurer of
theFaith. SotheKing went totheMaster andwithacourteous greeting sat
down byhisside, afterwhich heproceeded tostate hiswives' wish, andhisown
hope, thatAnanda might betheir teacher. TheMaster, having consented to
sendAnanda, theKing's wives nowbegan toberegularly taught bytheElder
andtolearn from him.
Onedaythejewel outoftheKing's turban wasmissing. When theKing
heard ofthelosshesent forhisministers andbadethem seize everyone who
had access totheprecincts and findthejewel. SotheMinisters searched
everybody, women and all,forthemissing jewel, tilltheyhadworried everybody
almost outoftheir lives;butnotrace ofitcould they find. ThatdayAnanda
came tothe palace, only tofind theKing's wives asdejected astheyhad
hitherto been delighted when hetaught them. "What hasmade you likethis
to-day]" asked theElder. "Oh, sir," said they, "theKing has lostthejewel
outofhisturban; andbyhisorders theministers areworrying everybody,
women and all,outoftheir lives, inorder tofind it.Wecan't saywhatmay

anymore about it,"said theElder cheerily, ashewent tofindtheKing.
Taking theseat setforhim, theElder asked whether itwastrue that his
majesty had losthisjewel, "(^uite true, sir,"saidtheKing. "And can itnot
befound?" "Ihavehad alltheinmates ofthepalaces worried outoftheir
lives, andyet Ican't find it.""There isoneway, sire, tofind it,without
worrying people outoftheir lives." "What way isthat, sir?" "By wisp-giving,
sire." "Wisp-giving? Whatmay tliat be,pray?" "Call together, sire, allthe
pei'sons you suspect, and privately giveeach oneofthem separately awisp
ofstraw, oralump ofclay willdo,saying, 'Take thisandput itinsuchand
such aplace to-morrow atdaybreak.' Theman thattook thejewel willput it
inthestraw orclay,andsobring itback. Ifitbebrought l)ack thevery first
day, wellandgood. Ifnot,thesame thing must bedone onthesecond and
third "days. Inthisway, alarge numbei' of])ersons willescape worry, andyou
willgetyovirjewel back." With these words theElder departed.
Following theabove counsel, theKing caused thestraw andclaytobedealt
outforthree successive days; butyetthejewel wasnotrecovered. [383]On
thethird daytheElder came again, andasked whether thejewel hadbeen
brought back. "No, sir," saidtheKing. "Then, sire,youmust have alarge
water-pot setinaretired corner ofyour courtyard, andyoumust have thepot
filled with water andascreen putupbefore it.Then give orders that all
whofrequent theprecincts, menandwomen alike, aretoput oft'their outer-
garments, andonebyonewash their hands behind thescreen andthencome
back." With thisadvice theElder departed. AndtheKing didashebade.
Thought the thief,"Ananda hasseriously taken thematter inhand; and, if
hedoes notfindthejewel, he'llnot letthings rest here. Thetime hasreally
come togivethejewel upwithout more ado." Sohesecreted thejewel about
hisperson, andgoing behind thescreen, dropped itinthewater before hewent
away. When everyone hadgone, thepotwas em]>tied, andthejewel found.
"It's allowing totheElder," exclaimed theKing inhisjoy,"that Ihave gotmy
jewel back,andthatwithout worrying ahost ofpeople outoftheir lives." And
allthepersons about theprecincts were equally grateful toAnanda forthe
trouble hehadsaved them from. The storyhowAnanda's marvellous powers
hadfound thejewel, spread through allthecity, till itreached theBrotherhood.
Said theBrethren, "The great knowledge, learning, andcleverness oftheElder
Ananda havebeen themeans atonce ofrecovering thelostjewel andofsaving
many jiersons from being worried outoftheir lives." And asthey satetogether
intheHall ofTruth, singing thepraises ofAnanda, theMaster entered and
asked thesidjject oftheir conversation. Being told,hesaid, "Brethren, this is
notthe firsttime thatwhat hadbeen stolen hasbeen found, nor isAnanda the
onlyonewhohasbrought about such adiscovery. Inbygone days toothewise
andgood discovered whathadbeen stolen away, andalsosaved ahost ofpeople
from troulile, shewing that the lost proi)erty had fallen into thehands of
animals." Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta, having perfected hiseducation, became one oftheKing's
ministers. OnedaytheKing with alarge following went into his
]jleasaunce, and, after walking about thewoods, feltadesire todisport
himself inthewater. Sohewentdown into theroyal tank and sent
forhisharem. Thewomen ofthehai'em, removing thejewels from their
heads andnecks andsoforth, laidthem aside with their upper gai*ments
inboxes under thecharge offemale slaves, andthenwentdown into

thewater. 'Now, asthequeen wastaking offherjewels andornaments,
andlaying them with herupper I'obeonabox, shewaswatched bya
female monkey, whicli washidden inthebranches ofatreehard by.
Conceiving alonging towear thequeen's pearl necklace, thismonkey

jewels gone,sawnothing else todobut toscream out,"Amanhasrun

andhearing thisstory told ittotheKing. "Catch thethief," said his
majesty;andaway went theguards searching highandlowforthethief
inthepleasaunce. Hearing thedin,apoor superstitious rustic' took to
hisheels inalarm. "There hegoes," cried theguards, catching sight of
therunaway; andthey followed himuptillthey caught him,andwith
blows demanded what hemeant bystealing such precious jewels.
Thouglit he,"IfIdeny thecharge, Ishall diewith thebeating I
shall getfrom these ruflSans. I'dbetter sayItook it."Soheconfessed
tothetheftandwashauled offaprisoner totheKing. "Did youtake
those precious jewels?" asked theKing. "Yes, your majesty." "Where
aretheynow?" "Please your majesty, I'mapoorman; I'venever in
my lifeowned anything, even abedorachair, ofanyvalue,—much less
ajewel. ItwastheTreasurer whomademetake thatvaluable necklace;
andItook itandgave ittohim.Heknows allabout it."
Then theKing sent fortheTreasurer, andasked whether therustic
hadpassed thenecklace ontohim. "Yes, sire,"wastheanswer. "Where
isitthen?" "Igave ittoyour majesty's Chaplain." Then theChaplain
wassent for,and interrogated inthesame way.And hesaidhehad
given ittotheChief Musician, who inhisturn saidhehadgiven ittoa
courtesan [385] asapresent. But she,being brought before theKing,
utterly denied everhaving received it.
Whilst the fivewere thus being questioned, thesun set. "It's too
latenow," saidtheKing; "we willlook into thisto-morrow." Sohe
handed thefiveover tohisministers andwent back intothe city. Here-
upon theBodhisatta fella-thinking. "These jewels," thought he,"were
lostinside thegrounds, wliilst therustic wasoutside. There wasastrong
guard atthegates, and itwasimpossible foranyone inside togetaway
1Orperhaps "ataxpaying ryot."

with thenecklace. Idonotseehowanyone, whether inside orout,conld
havemanaged tosecure it.Thetruth isthispoorwretched fellow must
have saidhegave ittotheTreasurer merely inorder tosave hisown
skin ;andtheTreasurer must have saidhegave ittotheChaplain, in
thehope thathewould get oflf ifhecould mix theChaplain upinthe
matter. Further, theChaplain must have saidhegave ittotheChief
Musician, because hethought thelatter would make thetime passmerrily
inpi'ison;whilst theChief Musician's object inimplicating thecourtesan,
wassimply tosolace himself with hercompany during imprisonment.
Notoneofthewhole fivehasanything todowith the theft. Onthe
other hand, thegrounds swarm withmonkeys, andthenecklace musthave
gotintothehands ofoneofthefemale monkeys."
When hehadarrived atthis conclusion, theBodhisatta went tothe
King with therequest that thesuspects might behanded over tohim
andthathemight beallowed toexamine personally into thematter.
"By allmeans, mywise friend," saidtheKing;"examine into it."
Then theBodhisatta sent forhisservants and toldthem where to
lodge thefive prisoners, saying, "Keep strict watch overthem ;listen to
everything they say,andreport italltome"And hisservants didashe
badethem. Astheprisoners sattogether, theTreasurer saidtotherustic,
"Tell me,youwretch, where youand Ievermetbefore thisday ;tellme
when yougavemethat necklace." "Worshipful sir," saidtheother, "it
hasnever beenmine toownaught sovaluable even asastool orbedstead
that wasn't rickety. Ithought that with your help Ishould getout
ofthis trouble, and that'swhy Isaidwhat Idid.Benotangry with
me,mylord." Said theChaplain [386] inhisturn totheTi-easurer, "How
thencameyoutopassontomewhat thisfellow hadnever given toyou?"
"Ionly saidsobecause Ithought that ifyou aiid I,bothhigh officers of
state, stand together, wecansoon putthematter right." "Brahmin,"
now saidtheChief Musician totheChaplain, "when, pray, didyougive
thejewel tome?" "Ionly said Idid,"answered theChaplain, "because
Ithought youwould help tomake thetime passmore agreeably." Lastly
thecourtesan said,"Oh, youwretch ofamusician, youknow younever
visited me,norIyou. Sowhen could youhave givenmethenecklace, as
yousay?" "Why beangry,mydear?" saidtheMusician, "we fivehave
gottokeephouse together forabit; soletusputacheerful faceonitand
behappy together."
This conversation being reported totheBodhisatta byhisagents, hefelt
convinced the fivewere allinnocent oftherobbery, andthat afemale
monkey hadtaken thenecklace. "And Imust findameans tomake her
drop it,"saidhetohimself. Sohehadanumber ofbead necklaces made.
Next hehadanumber ofmonkeys caught andturned loose again, with
strings ofbeads ontheir necks, wrists and ancles. Meantime, theguilty

monkey kept sitting inthe ti"ees watching hertreasure. Then theBodhi-
satta ordered anumber ofmen tocarefully observe everymonkey inthe
grounds, tilltheysawonewearing themissing pearl necklace, andthen
frighten herintodropping it.
Tricked outintheirnew splendour, theothermonkeys strutted about
tilltheycame tothereal thief, before whom they flaunted their tinery.
Jealousy overcoming herprudence, sheexclaimed, "They're onlybeads!"
andputonherown necklace ofreal pearls. Thiswas atonce seenby
thewatchers, whopromptly made herdrop thenecklace, which they
picked upandbrought totheBodhisatta. Hetook ittotheKing, saying,
"Here, sire, istlienecklace. The fiveprisoners areinnocent; itwasa
female monkey inthepleasaunce tliattook it.""How cameyou tofind
thatoutl" asked theKing; "andhow didyoumanage togetpossession
ofitagain 1"Then theBodhisatta toldthewhole story, andtheKing
thanked [387] theBodhisatta, saying, "You aretherightman intheright
place." Andheuttered thisstanza inpraise oftheBodhisatta:—
Forwarmen crave thehero's might.
Forcounsel sage sobriety.
Boon comrades fortheir jollity,
Butjudgment when inparlous plight.
Over andabove these words ofpraise andgratitude, theKiiag showered
treasures upon theBodhisatta likeastorm-cloud pouring rainfrom the
heavens. After following theBodhisatta's counsels through along life
S[)ent incharity andgood works, theKing passed away tofarethereafter

likewise shewed nocircumspection orcaution before iising food, clothing andother
requisites which their relations gavethem. Observing thistheMaster feltthathe
must readtheBrethren alesson. Sohecalled them together, andsaid,"Brethren,
nomatter whether [388] thegiver bearelation ornot, letcircumspection accom-
pany use.TheBrother whowithout circumspection usestheI'equisites which are

thosewho inbygone days actually didtakepoison because itwasoffered bythose

following story ofthepast.
Once upon atimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasaverywealthy merchant. Hehadaherdsman who,when
thecornwasgrowing thick, drove hiscows totheforest andkeptthem
there atashieling, bringing theproduce fi'om time totime tothemerchant.

poison totheherdsman andsenthim off".With theaidofanetwhich he
made, theherdsman caught thedoeandcarried outtheBodhisatta's orders.
Assoon ashesawthedoeagain, the lion, inhisgreat love forher,
licked herwith histongue sothathedied. And theherdsman took the
lion's hideandthe rest,andbrought them totheBodhisatta, who said,
"Affection forothers should beeschewed. Mai-k how, forallhisstrength,
theking ofbeasts, thelion,was ledbyhissinful love foradoetopoison
himself bylicking herandsotodie." Sosaying, heuttered thisstanza for
theinstruction ofthose gathered around:—
[389] Trust notthetrusted, nor th'untrusted trust;
Trust kills; through trust thelion bitthedust.
Suchwasthelesson which theBodhisatta taught tothose around him.
After alifespent incharity andother good works, hepassed away to

Foratthattime Sunakkliatta, having become anadherent oftheMaster,
wastravelling about thecountry asaBrother withbowlandrobes, when hewas

Buddha hisbowlandrobes and revei'ted toalay lifebyreason ofKora the
Kshatriya, about thetimewhen this latter hadbeen re-born astheoffspring
oftheKiilakaajaka Asura. And hewent jibout within thethree walls of
Vesali defoming theMaster byattirming that there wasnothing superhuman
about thesageGotama, whowasnotdistinguished from othermenbypreaching
asaving faith ;that thesageGotama haeisimply worked outasystem which
wastheoutcome ofhisownindividual thought andstudy ;andthattheideal for
theattainment ofwhich hisdoctrine waspreached, didnotlead tothedestruc-
tionofsorrow inthosewhofollowed it'-^.
Now thereverend Sariputta wasonhisround foralmswhen heheard
Sunakkhatta's blasphemies ;andonhisreturn from hisround hereported this
totheBlessed One. Said theMaster, "Sunakkhatta isahot-headed person,
Sariputta, andspeaks idlewords. Hishot-headeduess hasledhim totalk like
thisandtodeny thesaving grace ofmydoctrine. Unwittingly, thisfoolish person
isextolling me; Isayunwittingly, forhehasnoknowledge [390] ofmyefficacy.
Inme,Sariputta, dwell theSixKnowledges, andhereinam1more thanhuman;
theTenPowers arewithin me,andtheFourGrounds ofConfidence. 1know
thelimits ofthefourtypes ofearthly existence andthe fivestates ofpossible
re-birth after earthly death. This too isasuperhuman quality inme;and
whoso denies itmust retract hiswords, change his belief, andrenounce his
heresy, orhewillwithout adobecast into hell." Having thus magnified the
sui)ei-human nature and])ower which existed within him, theMaster wentonto
say,"Sunakkhatta, 1hear, Sariputta, to(jk delight inthemisguided self-mortifi-
cations oftheasceticism ofKora theKshatriya ;andtherefore itwasthathe
could takenopleasure inme. Ninety-one ;eons ago Ilived thehigher lifeinall

emaciated was I,beyond allothers ;loathing ofcomfort had I,aloathing
surpassing that ofallothers ;Idwelt apart, andunapproachable wasmypassion
forsolitude." Then, attheElder's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime, ninety-one jbous ago, theBodhisatta sethimself to

bythedrizzle from thebranches ofthethicket. Thus dayandnight
alike heendured theextremity ofcold. Insummer, heabode bydayinthe

coming inhisalms-pilgrimage toKusinara, there upon theNorthward bench

Elder Ananda, "OBlessed One, suffer notyourendtobeinthissorry little
town, this I'ough littletown inthejungle, this littlesuburban town. Shall not
Rajagaha orsome other large citybethedeath-place oftheBuddha?"
"Nay, Ananda," saidtheMaster; "call notthisasorry little town, alittle
town inthejungle, alittle suburban town. Inbygone days, inthedays of
Sudassana's universal monarchy, itwas inthistown that Ihadmydwelling. It
wasthen amighty cityencompassed byjewelled walls [392] twelve leagues
round." Therewithal, attheElder's request, hetold thisstory ofthepastand

Then itwas that Sudassana's queen Subhadda marked how, after
coming down from thePalace ofTruth, herlordwaslying hardbyon
hisright sideonthecouch prepared forhim inthePalm-grove^ which
was allofgoldandjewels,—thatcouch fromwhich hewasnot torise
again. And she said, "Eighty-four thousand cities, chief ofwhich is
theroyal-city ofKusavati, own youi- sovereignty, sire. Setyour heart
onthem."
"Say not so,myqueen," saidSudassana ;"rather exhort me,saying,
'Keep your heart setonthistown, andyearn notafter those others'."
"Why so,mylord?"
"Because Ishall dieto-day," answered theking.
Intears, wiping herstreavning eyes, thequeen managed tosol)out
thewords thekingbade hersay. Then shebroke intoweeping and
lamentation; andtheotherwomen oftheharem, tothenumber ofeighty-
four thousand, alsowept andwailed ;norcould any ofthecourtiers
forbear, but allalike joined inoneuniversal lament.
"Peace!" saidtheBodhisatta ;andathisword their lamentation was
stilled. Then, turning tothequeen, hesaid,—"Weep not,myqueen, nor
wail. For,evendown toatiny seed ofsesamum, there isnosuch thing
asacompound thing which is,permanent ;allaretransient, allmust
break up." Then, forthequeen's behoof, heuttered thisstanza:—
How transient are allcomponent things!

They areproduced, they aredissolved again:
Andthen isbest,—when theyhavesunk torest^.

typifies acollected state ofmind asregards things concerning thebody, andthe
lesson tobelearnt isthatsuch mindfulness should bej^i'actised andperfected.

cerning theBelle oftheLand, with both textandinterpretation. [.39.5] Then,

ofpractising right mindfulness concerning thebody, should beascareful notto

When theyhadheard theSutta and itsmeaning, theBrethren said:—"It
wasahard task, sir,fortheman topass l)ywith thepotofoilwithout gazing on
thecharms oftheBelle oftheLand." "Not hard atall,Brethren; itwasquite

thepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta w^astheyoungest oftheKing's hundred sons,andgrewuptomanhood.
Now inthose days there werePacceka Buddhas wlioused tocome totake
their meals atthepalace, andtheBodhisatta ministered tothem.
Thinking oneday ofthegreat number ofbrothers hehad, the
Bodhisatta asked himself whether there wasanylikelihood ofhiscoming
tothethrone ofhisfathers inthat city,anddetermined toaskthe
Pacceka Buddhas totellhimwhat should come topass. Next daythe
Buddhas came, took thewater-pot thatwasconsecrated toholy uses,
filtered thewater, washed anddried their feet,and satedown totheir
meal. And asthey sat, tlieBodhisatta cameandseating himself bythem
with acourteous salutation, put hisquestion. And theyanswered and
said, "Prince, you willnever come tobeking inthis city. But in
Gandhara, twothousand leagues away, there stands thecityofTakkasila.
Ifyoucanreach that city, inseven daysyou willbecome king there.
Butthere isperilontheroad thither, injourneying through agreat forest.
Itisdouble thedistance round the foi'est that itistopassthrough it.
Ogres have their dwelling therein, and ogresses make villages andhouses
arisebythewayside. Beneath agoodly canopy embroidered with stars
ovei'head, their magic sets acostly couch shut inl)yfaircurtains of
wondrous dye. Arranged incelestial splendoui* theogresses sitwithin
their abodes, seducing wayfarers [396] with honied words.'Weary you
seem,' they say ;'come hither, and eatanddrink before youjourney
further onyour way.' Those thatcome attheir bidding aregiven seats
and fired tolustbythecharm oftheir wanton beauty. But scarce have
they sinned, before theogresses slaythem andeatthem while thewarm

blood isstill flowing. And they ensnare men's senses,—captivating the
sense ofbeauty with utter loveliness, theearwith sweet minstrelsy, the
nostrils withheavenly odours, thetaste withheavenly dainties ofexquisite
savour, andthetouch with red-cushioned couches divinely soft. But if
youcansubdue your senses, andbestrong inyour resolve nottolook
upon them, thenontheseventh dayyou willbecome king ofthecityof
Takkasila."
"Oh, sirs ;how could Ilookupon theogresses after your advice to
me?" Sosaying, theBodhisatta besought thePacceka Buddhas togivehim
something tokeep him safeonhisjourney. Receiving from thtnn a
charmed thread andsome charmed sand, hefirst bade farewell tothe
Pacceka Buddhas and tohisfather andmother ;andthen, going tohis
own abode, headdressed hishousehold asfollows:—"Iamgoing to
Takkasila tomake myself king there. You willstopbehind here." But
fiveofthem answered, "Letusgotoo."
"You may notcome with me,"answered theBodhisatta; "for Iam
toldthat theway isbeset byogresses who captivate men's senses, and
destroy thosewhosuccumb totheir charms. Great isthedanger, butI
willrelyonmyself andgo."
"Ifwegowith you, prince, weshould notgazeupon their baleful
charms. WetoowillgotoTakkasila." "Then shew yourselves steadfast,"
saidtheBodhisatta, andtook those fivewithhimonhisjourney.
Theogresses satwaiting bytheway intheir villages. Andoneofthe
five,thelover ofbeauty, looked upon theogresses, andbeing ensnared by
their beauty, lagged behind therest. "Why areyoudropping behind ]"
asked theBodhisatta. "Myfeethurtme,prince. I'lljust sitdown fora
bitinoneofthese pavilions, andthen catch youup." "Mygoodman,
these areogresses ;don'thanker after them." "Bethat asitmay, prince,
Ican't goany further." "Well, you willsoon beshewn inyour real
colours," saidtheBodhisatta, ashewent onwith theother four.
Yielding tohissenses, thelover ofbeauty drew near totheogresses,
who[397] tempted himtosin,and killed himthenand there. Thereon
they departed, and fui-ther along theroad raised bymagic artsanew
pavilion, inwhich they satsinging tothemusic ofdivers instruments.
Andnow thelover ofmusic dropped behind andwaseaten. Then the
ogresses wentonfurther andsatwaiting inabazaar stocked with allsweet
scents andperfumes. And here thelover ofsweet-smelling things fell
behind. Andwhen theyhadeaten him, theywent onfurther andsatin

Only theBodhisatta was leftnow.And oneoftheogresses followed
him,promising herself that forallhisstern resolution shewould succeed in
devouring him eresheturned back. Further onintheforest, woodmen
andothers, seeing theogress, asked herwhothemanwas thatwalked on
ahead.
"He ismyhusband, good gentlemen."
"Hi, there !"saidthey totheBodhisatta; "when you liave gotasweet
young wife, fairastheflowers, toleave herhome andputhertrust inyou,
why don'tyouwalk with herinstead ofletting hertrudge wearily behind
you1""She isnowife ofmine, butanogress. Shehaseatenmyfive
companions." "Alas! good gentlemen," said she,"anger willdrivemen
tosaytheir verywives areogresses andghouls."
Next, shesimulated pregnancy andthen thelook ofawoman whohas
borne onechild; and child on hi[), shefollowed after theBodhisatta.
Everyone theymetasked justthesame questions about thepair,andthe
Bodhisatta gave just tliesameanswer ashejourneyed on.
Atlasthecame toTakkasila, where theogress made thechild dis-
appear, andfollowed alone. Atthegates ofthe city tlieBodhisatta
entered aRest-house and satdown. Because oftheBodhisatta's efficacy
andpower, shecould notenter too; soshearrayed liei-self indivine beauty
andstood onthethreshold.
TheKing ofTakkasila was atthatmoment passing byonhisway to
hispleasaunce, andwassnared byherloveliness. "Go, findout," saidhe
toanattendant, "whether shehasahusband [.398] with herornot."And
when themessenger cameandasked whether shehadahusband with her,
shesaid, "Yes, sir ;myhusband issitting witliin inthechamber."
"She isnowife ofmine," saidtheBodhisatta. "She isanogress and
haseatenmyfivecompanions."
And, asbefore, shesaid,"Alas !good gentlemen, anger willdrivemen
tosayanything thatcomes into their heads."
Then themanwentback totheKing andtoldhimwhat eachhadsaid.
"Treasure-trove isaroyal perquisite," saidtheKing. Andhesent forthe
ogress andhadherseated ontheback ofhiselephant. After asolemn
procession round the city, theKing came back tohispalace andhadthe
ogress lodged intheapartments reserved foraqueen-consort. After
bathing andperfuming himself, theKing atehisevening mealandthen
laydown onhisroyal bed. The ogress toojn-epai'ed herself ameal, and
donned allhersplendour. And asshelaybytheside ofthedelighted
King, sheturned ontohersideandburst into tears. Being askedwhy
shewept, she said, "Sire, youfound niebythewayside, andthewomen
oftheharem aremany. Dwelling hereamong enemies Ishall feelcrushed
when they say'Whoknows whoyour father andmother are,oranything
about your family? Youwere picked upbythewayside.' But ifyour

majesty would givemepower andauthority over thewhole kingdom,
nobody would dare toannoymewithsuch taunts."
"Sweetheart, Ihavenopower over those that dwell throughout my
kingdom ;Iamnottheir lordandmaster. Ihave only jurisdiction over
those who revolt ordoiniquity'. SoIcannot giveyoupower and
authority overthewhole kingdom."
"Then, sire, ifyoucannot givemeauthority over thekingdom orover
thecity, atleast givemeauthority within thepalace, that Imayhave rule
hereover those thatdwell inthepalace."
Toodeeply smitten withhercharms torefuse, theKing gaveherauthority
over allwithin thepalace andbade herhave ruleoverthem [399]. Con-
tented, shewaited tilltheKing was asleep, andthenmaking herway to
thecityofthe ogi-es returned with thewhole crew ofogres tothe[)alace.
Andsheherself slew theKing anddevoured him, skin, tendons andHesh,
leaving only thebare bones. And therestoftheogres entering thegate
devoured everything asitcame intheir way, notleaving even afowl ora
dog alive. Next daywhen peo[)le came andfound thegate shut, tliey
beatonitwithimpatient cries, andeffected anentrance,—only tofindthe
whole palace strewn with bones. And they exclaimed, "Sothemanwas
right insaying shewasnothiswifebutanogress. Inhisunwisdom the
King brought herhome tobehiswife,anddoubtless shehasassembled the
other ogres, devoured everybody, andthenmade off."
Now onthatdaytheBodhisatta, with thecharmed sandonhishead
andthecharmed thread twisted round hisbrow, wasstanding intheRest-
house, sword inhand, waiting forthedawn. Those others, meantime,
cleansed thepalace, garnished the floors afresh, sprinkled perfumes on
them, scattered flowers, hanging nosegays from theroofandfestooning the
walls with garlands, andburning incense intheplace. Then they took
counsel together, asfollows:—
"Theman thatcould somaster hissenses asnotsomuch astolook at
theogress asshefollowed him inherdivine beauty, isanoble andstead-
fastman, filled with wii^dom. With suchanoneasking, itAvould bewell
with thewhole kingdom. Letusmake himourking."
And allthecourtiers and allthecitizens ofthekingdom were one-
minded inthematter. SotheBodhisatta, being chosen king,wasescorted
intothecapital andthere decked injewels andanointed king ofTakkasila.
Shunning thefour evilpaths, andfollowing thetenpaths ofkingly duty,
heruled hiskingdom inrighteousness, andafter alifespent incharity and
other goodworks jjassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

NAMASIDDHI-JATAKA,
'•Seeing Quick c?ea(i."— This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aBrother whothought luckwent bynames. Forwehear tliatayoung
man ofgood family, named 'Base,' hadgiven hisheart totheFaith, andjoined
theBrotherhood. [402]And theBrethren used tocalltohim,"Here, Brother
Base!"and"Stay, Brother Base," tillheresolved that, as'Base' gave theideaof
incarnate wickedness and ill-luck, hewould change hisname tooneofbetter
omen. Accordingly heasked histeachers and pi-eceptors togivehim anew
name. Butthey saidthat aname only served todenote, anddidnotimpute
qualities ;andtheybadehim restcontent with thename hebad. Time after
time herenewed hisrequest, tillthewhole Brotherhood knew what importance
heattached toamerename. And asthey satdiscussing thematter intheHall
ofTruth, theMaster entered andasked what itwastheywerespeaking about.
Being told, hesaid"This isnotthe firsttime thisBrother hasbelieved luck
wentbynames ;hewasequally dissatisfied with thename hebore inaformer
age." Sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime theBodhisatta wasateacher ofworld-wide fame at
Takkasila, and fivehundred young brahmins learnt theVedas from his
lips. One oftliese young menwasnamed Base. Andfrom continually
hearing hisfellows say,"Go,Base"and"Come, Base," helonged togetrid
ofhisname and totakeonethathadalessill-omened ringabout it.So
hewent tohismaster andasked thatanewname ofarespectable charac-
termight begiven him. Said hismaster, "Go,myson,and travel
through theland tillyouhavefound anameyoufancy. Tlien come back
and Iwillchange yourname foryou."
Theyoung man didasliewasbidden, andtaking provisions forthe


238 TheJataka. Booh I.
journey wandered from village tovillage tillhecanie toacertain town.
Here amannamed Quick had died, andtheyoung brahmin seeing him
borne tothecemetery asked what hisname was.
"Quick," wasthereply. "What, canQuick Ijedead?" "Yes, Quick
isdead; bothQuick andDead diejustthesame.Aname only .serves to
mark who's who. Youseem afool."
Hearing thishewentonintothecity, feeling neither satisfied nordis-
satisfied with hisownname.
Now a.slave-girl hadbeen thi'own down atthedoor ofahouse, while
hermaster and mistress beat herwith rope-ends because shehadnot
brought home herwages. And thegirl'sname wasRich. [403] Seeing
thegirlbeing beaten, ashewalked along thestreet, heasked thereason,
andwastold inreply that itwasbecause shehadnowages toshew.
"Andwhat isthegirl'sname ?"
"Rich," said they. "And cannot Richmake good apaltry day's
pay?""Beshecalled Rich orPoor, themoney's notforthcoming any
themore.Aname only serv^es tomark who's who. Y^ouseem afool."
More reconciled tohisownname, theyoung brahmin leftthecityand
ontheroadfound anu^nwhohad lost hisway. Having learnt thathe
had losthisway, theyoung manasked what hisname was. "Guide,"
wasthereply. "And hasGuide lost hisway*?" "Guide orMisguide,
youcanloseyourway justthesame.Aname only serves tomark who's
who. Youseem afool."
Quite reconciled now tohisname, theyoung brahmin came back tohis
master.
"Well, whatname haveyouchosen'?" asked theBodhisatta. "Mastei-,"
said he,"Ifindthatdeath comes to'Quick' and'Dead' alike, that'Rich'
and'Poor 'maybepoor together, andthat'Guide'and'Misguide'alike
miss their way. Iknownowthataname serves only totellwho iswho,
anddoesnotgovern itsowner's destiny. SoIamsatisfied withmyown
name, anddonotwant tochange itforanyother."
Then theBodhisatta uttered this stanza, combining what theyoung
brahmin haddone witli thesights hehadseen:—
Seeing Quick dead, Guide lost.Rich poor.
Base learned content nortravelled more.
Hisstory told, theMaster said "Soyou see,Brethren, that informer days as
now thisBrother imagined there wasagreat deal inaname." Andheidentified
theBirth bysaying, "This Brother who isdiscontented with hisname wasthe
discontented young brahmin ofthose days; theBuddha's disciples were the
pupils; and Imyself their master.'

KUTAVANIJA-JATAKA.
[404]"Wise righth/, Wisest wronglyP—This story was toldbythe ]\Iaster
wliile atJetavana, a1)out acheating merchant. There weretwomerchants in
partnership atSfivatthi, wearetold,who travelled with their merchandise and
came backwith tlieproceeds. Andthecheating merchant thought tohimself,
"My 2^artner hasbeen badlj' fedandbadly lodged forsomany daj's pastthathe
willdieofindigestion nowhehasgothome again andcanfeast tohisheart's
content ondainties manifold. Myplan istodivide whatwohavemade into
three portions, giving onetohisorphans andkeeping two formyself." And
with this object hemadesome excuse daybydayforputting oft"thedivision of
theprofits.
Finding thAt itwasinvain topress foradivision, thehonest partner went to
theMaster atthemonastery, made hissalutation, andwasreceived kindly. "It
isaverylong time," saidtheBuddha, "since youcame lasttoseeme."And
hereupon themerchant toldtheMaster whathadbefallen him.
"This isnotthe first time, lay-follower," saidtheMaster, "that thisman
hasbeen acheating merchant; hewasnolessacheat intimes past. Ashe
tries todefraud younow, sodidhetrytodefraud thewiseandgood ofother
days." Sosaying, atthemerchant's request, theMaster told thisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn into amerchant'.s family andonname-day wasnamed
'Wise.' When hegrew upheentered into partnership with another
merchant named 'Wisest,' andtraded with him.And these twotook five
hundred waggons ofmerchandise from Benares tothecountry-districts,
where they dispo.sed oftheir wares, returning afterwards with theproceeds
tothecity.When thetime fordividing came, Wisest said,"Imusthave
adouble share." "Why so?"asked Wise. "Because while youareonly
Wise, IamWisest. AndWise ought tohave onlyoneshare toWisest's
two." "Butwebothhadanequal interest inthestock-in-trade and in
theoxenandwaggons. Why should youhavetwoshares'?" "Because I
amWisest." And sothey talked away tillthey felltoquarrelling.
"Ah!" thought Wisest, "Ihave aplan." Andhemade hisfather hide
in[405] ahollo.w tree, enjoining theoldman tosay,when thetwocame,
"Wisest should have adouble portion." This arranged, hewent tothe
Bodhisatta andproposed tohim torefer theclaim foradouble shai-e to
thecompetent decision oftheTree-Sprite. Then hemade hisappeal in
these words: "Lord Tree-Sprite, decide ourcause!" Hex'eupon thefather,
whowashidden inthetree, inachanged voice asked them tostate the

case. Thecheat addressed thetree asfollows: "Lord, here stands Wise,
andherestand IWisest. Wehavebeen partners intrade. Declare what
share eachshould receive."
"Wise should receive oneshare, andWisest two," wastheresponse.
Hearing this decision, theBodhisatta resolved tofindoutwhether it
wasindeed aTree-Sprite ornot. Sohefilled thehollow trunk withstraw
and set itonfire.And Wisest's father was half roasted bytherising
flames andclambered upbyclutching hold ofabough. Falling tothe
ground, heuttered thisstanza:—
Wise rightly, Wisest wrongly gothisname;
Through Wisest, I'mnigh roasted intheflame.
Then thetwomerchants made anequal division andeachtook half,
andattheir deaths passed away tofareaccording totheir deserts.
"Thus you see," saidtheMaster, "that your partner wasasgreat acheat in
pasttimes asnow." Having ended hisstory, heidentified theBirtli bysaying,
"The cheating merchant ofto-day wasthecheating merchant inthestory, and
Ithehonest merchant named Wise."
