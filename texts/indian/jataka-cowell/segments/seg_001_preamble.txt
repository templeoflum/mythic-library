PREFACE.
Itwasanalmost isolated incident inGreek literary history\
when Pythagoras claimed toremember hisprevious lives. Heracleides
Ponticus relates thatheprofessed tohavebeen onceborn as^tha-
lides, thesonofHermes, and tohave then obtained asaboon from
hisfather ^covra koIreXevrcopTa /u,v7]fir]v e^€Lv twvav/^^aivovrcov^.
Consequently heremembered theTrojan war,where, asEuphorbus,
hewaswounded byMenelaus, and, asPythagoras, hecould still
recognise theshield which Menelaus hadhungupinthetemple of
Apollo atBranchidse ;andsimilarly heremembered hissubsequent
birth asHermotimus, andthen asPyrrhus, afisherman ofDelos.
But inIndia this recollection ofprevious lives isacommon feature
inthehistories ofthesaints andheroes ofsacred tradition ;and itis
especially mentioned byManu^ asthe effect ofaself-denying and
pious life.The doctrine ofMetempsychosis, since thelater Vedic
period, hasplayed such animportant part inthehistory ofthe
national character andreligious ideas thatweneed notbesurprised
tofindthatBuddhist literature from the earliest times (although
giving atheory ofitsown toexplain thetransmigration) hasalways
included theages ofthepast asanauthentic background tothe
founder's historical lifeasGautama. Jataka legends occur even in
theCanonical Pitakas; thus theSukha-vihari Jataka and the
Tittira Jataka, which arerespectively the10thandthe37th inthis
volume, arefound intheCuUa Vagga, vii.1and vi.6,andsimilarly
theKhandhavatta Jataka, which willbegiven inthenextvolume, is
found intheCuUaVagga v.6;andthere areseveral other examples.
Sotoooneoftheminor books oftheSutta Pitaka (theCariya
Pitaka) consists of35Jatakas told inverse; and ten atleast

vi Preface.
ofthese canbeidentified inthevolumes ofourpresent collection
already published;andprobably several oftheothers willbetraced
when itisallprinted. TheSutta andVinaya Pitakas aregenerally
accepted asatleast older than theCouncil ofVesali (380 B.C. ?);
andthus Jataka legends must have been always recognised in
Buddhist literature.
This conclusion isconfirmed bythefactthatJataka scenes are
found sculptured inthecarvings onthe railings round the relic
shrines ofSanchi andAmaravati andespecially those ofBharhut^
where the titles ofseveral Jatakas are clearly inscribed over
some ofthe carvings. These bas-reliefs prove that the birth-
legends were widely known inthethird century B.C.andwere then
cousidered aspart ofthesacred history ofthe religion. Fah-hian,
when hevisited Ceylon, (400 A.D.), sawatAbhayagiri "representa-
tions ofthe500bodily forms which theBodhisatta assumed during
hissuccessive births'V' andheparticularly mentions hisbirths as
Sou-ta-nou, abright flash oflight, theking oftheelephants, andan
antelope*. These legends were alsocontinually introduced intothe
religious discourses* which were delivered bythevarious teachers in
thecourse oftheir wanderings, whether tomagnify theglory ofthe
Buddha ortoillustrate Buddhist doctrines andprecepts byappropriate
examples, somewhat inthesame way asmediaeval preachers in
Europe used toenliven their sermons byintroducing fables and
popular tales torouse theflagging attention oftheir hearers^
Itisquite uncertain when these various birth-stories were put
together inasystematic form such aswefind inourpresent Jataka
collection. At firstthey were probably handed down orally, but
theirgrowing popularity would ensure that their kernel, atany rate,
would erelong becommitted tosome more permanent form. In
factthere isasingular parallel tothis inthe'Gesta Romanorum',
which wascompiled byanuncertain author inthe14th century and
contains nearly 200 fables and stories told toillustrate various
virtues and vices, many ofthem winding upwith areligious
application.

Preface. vii
Some ofthebirth-stories areevidently Buddhistic andentirely
depend fortheir point onsomecustom oridea peculiar toBuddhism
;
butmany arepieces offolk-lore which have floated about theworld
forages asthestray waifs ofliterature andareliable everywhere to
beappropriated byanycasual claimant. Thesame stories may thus,
inthecourse oftheir longwanderings, come toberecognised under
widely different aspects, aswhen they areusedbyBoccaccio orPoggio
merely asmerry tales, orbysome Welsh bard toembellish king
Arthur's legendary glories, orbysome Buddhist samana ormediaeval
friar toaddpoint tohisdiscourse. Chaucer unwittingly puts a
Jataka story intothemouth ofhisPardonere when hetells histale
of'theryotoures three
';andanother appears inHerodotus asthe
popular explanation ofthesudden riseoftheAlcmajonidge through
Megacles' marriage with Cleisthenes' daughter andtherejection of
hisrival Hippocleides.
The Paliwork, entitled'theJataka ',the firstvolume ofwhich
isnowpresented tothereader inanEnglish form, contains 550
.fatakas orBirth-stories, which arearranged in22nipatas orbooks.
This division isroughly founded onthenumber ofverses (gathas)
which arequoted ineach story ;thus the firstbook contains
150 stories, each ofwhich onlyquotes oneverse, thesecond 100,each
ofwhich quotes two,thethirdandfourth 50each,which respectively
quote 3and 4,and soontothetwenty-first with 5stories, each of
which quotes 80verses, andthetwenty-second with10stories, each
quoting astill larger number. Each story opens with apreface
called thepacciippannavatthu or'story ofthepresent', which relates
theparticular circumstances intheBuddha's lifewhich ledhim to
tellthebirth-story andthus reveal some event inthelong series
ofhisprevious existences asabodhisatta orabeing destined toattain
Buddha-ship. Attheendthere isalways given ashort summary,
where theBuddha identifies thedifferent actors inthestory intheir
present births atthetime ofhisdiscourse,—itbeing anessential
condition ofthebook thattheBuddha possesses thesame power as
thatwhich Pythagoras claimed butwith afarmore extensive range,
since hecouldremember allthepastevents inevery being's previous
existences aswell asinhisown. Every story isalso illustrated by
oneormore gathas which areuttered bytheBuddha while stilla
Bodhisatta and soplaying hispart inthenarrative ;butsometimes
theverses areputinto hismouth astheBuddha, when they are
called abhisamhuddha-gatha.


viii Preface.
Some ofthese stanzas arefound inthecanonical book called the
Dhammapada ;andmany oftheJataka stories aregiven intheold
Commentary onthatbook butwith varying details, andsometimes
associated with verses which arenotgiven inourpresent Jataka
text. Tliismight seem toimply that there isnotnecessarily astrict
connexion between anyparticular story andtheverses which may
bequoted asitsmoral ;butinmost cases anapposite stanza would
ofcourse soon assert aprescriptive right toanynarrative which
itseemed specially toillustrate. Thelanguage ofthegathas is
much more archaic than that ofthestories ;and itcertainly seems
more probable tosuppose thatthey aretheolder kernel ofthework,
andthatthus initsoriginal form theJataka, liketheCariya-pitaka,
consisted only ofthese verses. Itisquite true that they are
generally unintelligible without thestory, butsuch iscontinually the
case with proverbial sayings ;thetraditional commentary passes by
word ofmouth inavarying form along with theadage, asinthe
well-known ov(ppovrU 'WTroKXeiSj} orourown'Hobson's choice',
untilsome author writes itdown inacrystallised form\ Occasionally
thesame birth-story isrepeated elsewhere inasomewhat varied
formandwith different verses attached toit ;andwesometimes find
thephrase itivitthdretabbam^, which seems toimply thatthenarrator
istoamplify thedetails athisdiscretion.
Thenative tradition inCeylon isthat theoriginal Jataka Book
consisted ofthegdthds alone, and that acommentary onthese,
containing the stories which they were intended toillustrate, was
written invery early times inSinghalese. This was translated
into Paliabout 430 A.u.byBuddhaghosa, who translated somany
oftheearly Singhalese commentaries into Pali; and after thisthe
Singhalese original was lost. The accuracy ofthis tradition has
been discussed byProfessor Rhys Davids intheIntroduction to
the firstvolume ofhis'Buddhist Birth Stories '';andwemay
safely adopt hisconclusion, that iftheprose commentary was
notcomposed byBuddhaghosa, itwascomposed notlong after-
wards;and asinanycase itwasmerely aredaction ofmaterials
1Wehaveaninteresting illustration oftheproverbial character ofsome ofthe
Jataka stories intheSaiikhya Aphorisms, iv.11,"hewho iswithout hoiie ishappy
likePingala," which finds itsexplanation inJat.330. Itisalso referred tointhe

handed down from very early times intheBuddhist community, itis
notaquestion ofmuch importance except forPali literary history.
Thegathas areundoubtedly old,andthey necessarily imply the
previous existence ofthe stories, though notperhaps intheexact
words inwhich wenowpossess them.
TheJatakas arepreceded inthePalitextbyalong Introduction,
theNidana-katha, which gives theBuddha's previous history both
before his last birth, and alsoduring hislast existence until he
attained thestate ofaBuddha\ Thishasbeen translated byProfessor
Rhys Davids, butasithasnodirect connexion with therest ofthe
work,wehave omitted itinourtranslation, which commences with
the first Birth-story.
Wehave translated the quasi-historical introductions which
always precede thedifferent birth-stories, asthey areanessential
partoftheplan oftheoriginal woik,—since they linkeach talewith
some special incident intheBuddha's life,which tradition venerates
astheoccasion when heissupposed tohave recalled theforgotten
scene ofalong past existence tohiscontemporaries. But itisan
interesting question forfuture investigation how farthey contain any
historical data. They appear atfirst sight toharmonise with the
framework ofthePitakas;butIconfess that Ihavenoconfidence in
their historical credibility,—theyseem tomerather thelaboured
invention ofalater age, likethelegendary history oftheearly
centuries ofancient Rome. But thisquestion willbemore easily
settled, whenwehavemade further progress inthetranslation.
TheJatakas themselves areofcourse interesting asspecimens
ofBuddhist literature ;buttheir foremost interest tousconsists in
their relation tofolk-lore andthelight which they often throw on
those popular stories which illustrate sovividly the ideas and
superstitions oftheearly times ofcivilisation. Inthisrespect they
possess aspecial value, as,although much oftheir matter ispeculiar
toBuddhism, they contain embedded with itanunrivalled collection
ofFolk-lore. They arealso fullofinterest asgiving avivid picture
ofthe social lifeandcustoms ofancient India. Such books as
Lieutenant-Colonel Sleeman's 'Rambles' orMrGrierson's 'Bihar
Peasant Life' illustrate them atevery turn. They form infactan
ever-shifting panorama ofthe village lifesuch asFah-hian and
Hiouen-thsang saw itinthe olddays before theMuhammadan

conquest, whenHindu institutions andnative ruleprevailed inevery
province throughout theland. Like allcollections ofearly popular
tales they are fullofviolence and craft, andbetray alowopinion of
woman;butoutbursts ofnobler feeling arenotwanting, torelieve
thedarker colours.
Professor Rhys Davids firstcommenced atranslation ofthe
Jataka in1880, butother engagements obliged him todiscontinue it
after onevolume hadappeared, containing theNidanakatha and
40stories. Thepresent translation hasbeen undertaken byaband
offriends whohope,byeachbeing responsible foradefinite portion,
tocomplete thewhole within areasonable time.Weareinfact

although wehave adopted somecommon principles oftranslation

intransliteration, wehave agreed toleave each individual translator,
within certain limits, afreehand inhisownwork. TheEditor only
