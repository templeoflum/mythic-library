didnotbelieve him. Then backcame theBodhisatta andfrom mid-air
recited thisstanza :—
Who sagely meditates onsunandmoon.

Gives place) hisafter-lot inRadiant Realmsi.
SuchwastheBodhisatta's teaching, and, first praising hisdisciple, he

tohishouse orfield fortheir garlic. Nowoneholiday thesupply ofgarlic inthe
house ranout,andtheSister FatNanda, coming with others tothehouse, was
told,when shesaidshewanted some garlic, thattherewasnone leftinthehouse,
ithad allbeen usedupoutofhand, andthat shemust gotothe field for it.
Soaway tothefieldshewentandcarried off"anexcessive amount ofgarlic. The
bailiff' grew angry andremarked what agreedy lotthese Sisters were !This
piqued themore moderate Sisters ;andtheBrethren toowere piqued atthe
taunt when theSisters repeated ittothem, andthey toldtheBlessed One.
Kebuking tliegreed ofFatNanda, theMaster said, "Brethren, agreedy person
isharsh andunkind even tothemother whoborehim ;agreedy person cannot
convert theunconverted, ormake theconverted grow ingrace, orcause alms to
come in,orsavethemwhencome in;whereas themoderate person candoall
these things." Insuch wisedidtheMaster point themoral, ending bysaying,
"Brethren, asFatNanda isgreedy now, soshewasgreedy intimes gone by."
Andthereupon hetoldthefollowing story ofthepast.
Once upon atimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin, andgrowing upwasmarried toabride
ofhisownrank,whoborehimthree daughters named Nanda, Nanda-vatI
and Sundari-nauda. The Bodhisatta dying, they were taken inby
neighbours and friends, whilst hewasborn again into theworld asa
golden mallard endowed with consciousness ofitsformer existences.
Growing up,thebirdviewed itsownmagnificent sizeandgolden plumage,
andremembered that previously ithadbeen ahuman being. Discovering
that hiswifeanddaughters were living onthecharity ofothers, the
mallard bethought himofhisplumage likehammered andbeaten goldand
howbygiving them agolden feather atatimehecould enable hiswife
anddaughters toliveincomfort. Soaway heflew towhere theydwelt
andalighted onthe tO})oftliecentral beam ofthe roof. Seeing the
Bodhisatta, [476] thewifeand girlsasked where hehadcome from; and
hetoldthem that hewas their father whohad diedandbeen born
agolden mallard, andthathehadcome tovisitthem andputanend
totheir miserable necessity ofworking forhire. "You shall havemy
feathers," said he,"onebyone,andthey will sellforenough tokeepyou
allineaseandcomfort." Sosaying, hegavethem oneofhisfeathers and
departed. And from time totime hereturned togivethem another
feather, andwith theproceeds oftheir sale these brahmin-women grew
prosperous andquite well-to-do. Butonedaythemother said toher
daughters, "There's notrusting animals, mychildren. Who's tosayyour
father might notgoaway oneofthese daysandnever come back again?
Letususeourtimeandpluck himclean nexttime hecomes, soasto
make sure ofallhisfeathers." Thinking thiswould pain him, the
daughters refused. Themother inhergreed called thegolden mallard to
heronedaywhen hecame, andthen tookhimwith both hands and
plucked him.Now theBodhisatta's feathers had thisproperty that if

theywere plucked outagainst hiswish, they ceased tobegolden and
became like acrane's feathers. Andnow thepoor l)ii'd, though he
stretched hiswings, could not fly,andthewoman flunghimintoabarrel
andgave him food there. Astimewent onhisfeathers grew again
(though theywere plain white onesnow), andheflewaway tohisown
abode andnever came back again.
Attheclose ofthisstory theMaster said,"Thus you see.Brethren, howFat
Nanda wasasgreedy intimes past asshe isnow.Andhergreed then losther
thegold inthesamewayashergreednow will loseherthe garlic. Observe,
moreover, howhergreed hasdeprived thewhole Sistei-hood oftheir supply of
garlic, andlearn therefrom tobemoderate inyour desires andtobecontent with
what isgiven you,however small thatmay be." Sosaying, heuttered this
stanza:—
Contented be,noritch forfui'ther store.
They seized theswan—buthad itsgoldnomore.
Sosaying, theMaster soundly rebuked theerring Sister and laiddown the
precept thatanySister whoshould eatgarlic would have todopenance. Then,
[477]making theconnexion, hesaid,"Fat Nandil wasthebrahmin's wife ofthe
story, herthree sisters were thebrahmin's three daughters, and Imyself the
golden mallard."

about theprecept respecting Kaiia's mother. Shewasalay-sister atSavatthi
known only asKana's mother, whohadentered thePaths ofSalvation andwas
oftheElect. Herdaughter Kana^wasmarried toahusband oftliesame caste
inanother village, andsome errand orothermade hergotoseehermother. A
fewdayswent by,andherhusband sent amessenger tosayhewished herto

said shecould notgobackempty-handed after solonganabsence, and set
about making acake. Justthenupcame aBrother going hisround foralms,

and toldanother Brother, whocame upjust intime togetthesecond cake
thatwasbaked forthedaughter totakehome with her.Hetoldatliird, and
the tliird toldafourth, and soeach fresh cakewastaken byafresh comer.
The result ofthiswasthat thedaughter didnotstart onherwayhome, and
thehusband sentasecond andathird messenger after her.Andthemessage he
sentbythethird wasthat ifhiswifedidnotcome back, heshould getanother
wife. And each message hadexactly thesame result. 80thehusband took
another wife,andatthenews hisfoi-mcr wife fella-weeping. Knowing allthis,
theMaster putonhisrobes early inthemorning andwent with hisalms-bowl to
thehouse ofKana's motlier andsatdown ontheseat setforhim.Then heasked
whythedaughter wascrying, and,being told,spoke words ofconsolation tothe
mother, andaroseandwentback totheMonastery.
Now theBi'ethren came toknowhowKana hadbeen stopped three times
from going back toherhusband owing totheaction ofthefourBrothers ;and
onedaytheymetintheHall ofTruth andbegan totalkabout tliematter. The
Miister came intotheHall [478]andasked what theywere discussing, andthey
told him. "Brethren," said he,"think not this isthe firsttime those four
Brothers havebrought sorrow onKana's mother byeating ofherstore ;they did
thelike indaysgonebytoo." Sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn astone-cutter, andgrowing upbecame expert in
working stones. Now intheKasi country there dwelt avery richmer-
chantwhohadamassed forty crores ingold. Andwhen hiswife died, so
strong washerlove ofmoney that shewas re-born amouse anddwelt
over thetreasure. And onebyonethewhole family died, including the
mei'chant himself. Likewise thevillage became deserted andforlorn. At
thetime ofourstory theBodhisatta wasquarrying andshaping stones
onthesiteofthisdeserted village; andthemouse used often toseehimas
sheranabout tofind food. Atlast she fellinlove with him; and,
bethinking herhowthesecret ofallhervastwealth would diewith her,she
conceived theidea ofenjoying itwith him. Soonedayshecame tothe
Bodhisatta with acoin inhermouth. Seeing this, hespoke toher
kindly, and said, "Mother, what hasbrought youherewith thiscoinT'
"It isforyou tolayoutforyoui-self, and tobuymeat with formeas
well,mysou." Nowise loth,hetook themoney andspent ahalfpenny of
itonmeat which hebrought tothemouse, whodeparted andatetoher
heart's content. And thiswent on,themouse giving theBodhisatta a
coinevery day,andheinreturn su})plying herwith meat. But itfell
outonedaythatthemouse wascaught byacat.
"Don't killme," saidthemouse.
"Why not 1"saidthecat. "I'mashungry ascanbe,andreally must
killyoutoallay thepangs."
"First, tellmewliether you're always hungry, oronlyhungry today."
"Oh,every dayfindsmehungry again."
"Well then, ifthisbeso,Iwill findyoualways inmeat; [479] only
letmesro,"


296 TheJataka. Book I.
"Mind youdothen," saidthecat,and letthemouse go.
Asaconsequence ofthisthemouse hadtodivide thesupplies ofmeat
shegotfi'om theBodhisatta intotwoportions andgaveonehalf tothecat,
keeping theother forherself.
Now, asluckwould have it,thesamemouse wascaught another day
byasecond catandhadtopurchase herrelease onthesame terms. So
now thedaily foodwasdivided into three portions. Andwhen athird
catcaught themouse andalikearrangement hadtobemade, thesupply
wasdivided intofour portions. And later afourth catcaught her,andthe
foodhad tobedivided among five, sothat themouse, reduced tosuch
short coinmons, grew sothin astobenothing butskinand bone.
Remarking howemaciated hisfriend wasgetting, theBodhisatta asked the
reason. Then themouse toldhim allthathadbefallen her.
"Why didn't you tellmeallthisbefore?" saidtheBodhisatta. "Cheer
lip, I'llhelpyououtofyour troubles." Sohetook ablock ofthepurest
crystal andscooped outacavity initandmade themouse getinside.
"Now stop there," said he,"and don't failtofiercely threaten and revile
allwhocome near."
Sothemouse crept intothecrystal cellandwaited. Upcame oneof
thecatsanddemanded hismeat. "Away, vilegrimalkin," saidthemouse;
"why should Isupply you? gohome and eatyour kittens!" Infuriated
atthese words, andnever suspecting themouse tobeinside thecrystal,
thecatsprang atthemouse toeatherup ;and sofurious was itsspring
that itbroke thewalls ofitschest and itseyes started from itshead.
Sothat catdiedand itscarcase tumbled down outofsight. And the
like fateinturn befell allfour cats.And ever after thegrateful mouse
brought theBodhisatta twoorthree coins instead ofoneasbefore, andby
degrees shethusgavehimthewhole ofthehoard. Inunbroken friend-
ship thetwo lived together, tilltheir lives ended andthey passed away
tofareaccording totheir deserts.
Thestory told, theMaster, asBuddha, uttered thisstanza:—[480]
Give food toone cat,Number Two appears:
Athird andfourth succeed iufruitful line;—Witness thefour thatbythecrystal died.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "These four
Brethren were thefour cats ofthose days, Kaiia's mother wasthemouse, and I
thestone-cutter."

"With matted hair."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about ahypocrite. Theincidents were likethose above related^
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn alizard; and inahutbardbyavillage ontheborders
there lived arigid ascetic whohadattained theFiveKnowledges, andwas
treated withgreat respect bythevillagers. Inanant-hill attheendofthe
walk whei-e therecluse paced upanddown, dwelt theBodhisatta, and
twice orthrice eachdayhewould gototherecluse andhearwords of
edification and holiness. Then withdueobeisance tothegoodman, the
Bodhisatta would depart tohisown abode. After acertain time the
ascetic bade farewell tothevillagers andwent away. Inhisstead there
came another ascetic, arascally fellow, todwell inthehermitage. Assum-
ingtheholiness ofthenew-comer, theBodhisatta acted towards himasto
the first ascetic. Onedayanunexpected storm inthedryseason brought
outtheantsontheir hills", andthelizards, coming abroad toeatthem, were
caught ingreatnumbers [481] bythevillage folk; andsomewere served up
with vinegar andsugar fortheascetic toeat. Pleased with sosavoury a
dish, heasked what itwas,andlearned that itwasadish oflizards.
Hereon hereflected thathehadaremarkably finelizard ashisneighbour,
and resolved todine offhim. Accordingly hemade ready thepotfor
cooking andsauce toserve thelizard in,and satatthedoor ofhishut
with amallet hidden under hisyellow robe, awaiting theBodhisatta's
coming, with astudied airofperfect peace. Atevening theBodhisatta
came, andashedrew near,marked thatthehermit didnotseem quite the
same, buthadalook about him that Ijoded nogood. Snuffing upthe
windwhich wasblowing towards himfrom thehermit's cell,theBodhisatta
smelt thesmell oflizard's flesh, and atonce realised how thetaste of
lizard hadmade theascetic want tokillhimwith amallet and eathim
up.Soheretired homeward without calling ontheascetic. Seeing that
theBodliisatta didnotcome, theascetic judged thatthelizard must have
divined hisplot, butmarvelled howhecould have discovered it.Deter-
mined that thelizard should notescape, hedrew outthemallet andthrew

ic,justhitting thetipofthelizard's tail. Quick asthought theBodhisatta
dashed into hisfastness, andputting hishead outbyadifferent hole to
thatbywhich hehadgone in,cried, "Rascally hypocrite, your garb of
piety ledmetotrust you,butnowIknow your villainous nature. What
hasathief likeyoutodowith hermit's clothing?"Thus upbraiding the
false ascetic, theBodhisatta lecited thisstanza:—
With matted hairandgarb ofskin
Why ape tli'ascetic's piety?
Asaint without, thyheart within
Ischoked with foulimpurityi.
[482] Inthiswise didtheBodhisatta expose thewicked ascetic, after
which heretired into hisant-hill. And thewicked ascetic departed from
that place.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "The hypocrite
wasthewicked ascetic ofthose days, Sfiriputta thegood ascetic who lived inthe
hermitage before him,and Imyself thelizard."
