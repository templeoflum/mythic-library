histackle went offwith liis little boy,and cast hishook into themost
likely waters known tohisfellow-fishermen. Now [483] asnagcaught

"In ceaseless dread."—This storywas t(jldbytheMaster while atJetavaua,
about asagacious counsellor. Theincidents willberelated inthetwelfth book
inconnection with theBhaddasala-jatakai.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta wasborn acrow. OnedaytheKing's chaplain went out
from the city tothe river, bathed there, andhaving perfumed and
garlanded himself, donned hisbravest array andcame back tothecity.On
thearchway ofthecitygatethere sattwocrows ;andoneofthem said to
hismate, "Imean tofoul thisbrahmin's head." "Oh, don't doanysuch
thing," saidtheother; "for thisbrahmin isagreat man,and itisanevil
thing toincur thehatred ofthegreat. Ifyouanger him,hemaydestroy
thewhole ofourkind." "Ireally must," saidthe first. "Very well,
you're sure tobefound out," saidtheother, andflewquickly away. Just
when thebrahmin wasunder thebattlements, down dropped the filth
uponhim asifthecrow were dropping afestoon. Theenraged brahmin
forthwith conceived hatred against allcrows.
Now atthistime itchanced thatafemale slave incharge ofagranary
spread thericeoutinthesunatthegranary doorandwassitting there to
watch it,when she fellasleep. Justthenupcame ashaggy goatand fell
toeating therice tillthegirlwoke upanddrove itaway. Twice orthree
times thegoatcame back, assoon asshe fellasleep, and atethe rice.
[485] Sowhen shehaddriven thecreature away forthethird time she
bethought herthatcontinued visits ofthegoatwould consume halfherstore
ofriceandthat stepsmust betaken toscare theanimal away forgood
andsosave herfrom sogreat aloss. Soshetook alighted torch, and,
sitting down, pretended tofallasleep asusual. Andwhen thegoatwas
eating, shesuddenly sprang upandhit itsshaggy back with hertorch.
Atonce thegoat's shaggy hide w^as allablaze, and toease itspain, it
dashed intoahay-shed near theelephant's stable and rolled inthehay.
Sotheshed caught fireandtheflames spread tothe stables. Asthese
stables caught fire,theelephants began tosufier, andmany ofthem were
badly burnt beyond theskill oftheelephant-doctors tocure.When this

wasreported totheKing, heasked hischaplain whether heknew what
would cure theelephants. "Certainly Ido,sire," said thechaplain, and
being pressed toexplain, saidhisnostrum wascrows' fat.Then theKing
ordered crows tobekilled andtheir fattaken. Andforthwith therewas
agreat slaughter ofcrows, butnever wasany fatfound onthem, andso
they Avent onkilling tilldead crows layinheaps everywhere. And a
great fearwasupon allcrows.
Now inthose days theBodhisatta hadhisdwelling inagreat cemetery,
atthehead ofeighty thousand crows. One ofthese brought tidings to
him ofthefear thatwasupon thecrows. And theBodhisatta, feeling
that there wasnone buthimwho could essay thetask, resolved tofree
hiskinsfolk from their great dread. Reviewing theTen Perfections,
and selecting therefrom Kindness ashisguide, heflewwithout stopping
right u})totheKing's palace, and entering inattheopenwindow
alighted underneath theKing's throne. Straightway aservant tried to
catch thebird,buttheKing entering thechamber forbade him.
Recovering himself inamoment, theGreat Being, remembering
Kindness, came forth frombeneath theKing's throne andspoke thus to
theKing;— "Sire, aking should remember themaxim thatkings should
notwalk according tolustandother evilpassions inruling theirkingdoms.
Before taking action, itismeet first toexamine andknow thewhole
matter, andthenonly todothatwhich being done issalutary. Ifkings
dothatwhich being done isnot salutary, tliey filltliousands with a
great fear, even thefear ofdeath. [486] And inprescribing crows'
fat,your cha})lain wasprompted byrevenge tolie; forcrows have
nofat."
Bythese words theKing's heart waswon,andhebade theBodhisatta
besetonathrone ofgoldandthere anointed beneath thewings with the
choicest oilsandserved invessels ofgoldwith theKing's ownmeats and
drink. Thenwhen theGreat Being was filledandatease, theKing said,
"Sage, yousaythatcrows have nofat.How comes itthat theyhave
nonel"
"Inthiswise," answered theBodhisatta with avoice that filled the
whole palace, andheproclaimed theTruth inthisstanza:—
Inceaseless dread, with allmankind forfoes,
Their life ispassed; andhence nofathave crows.
This explanation given, tlieGreat Being taught theKing, saying,
"Sire, kings should never actwithout examining andknowing thewhole
matter." Well pleased, theKing laidhiskingdom attheBodhisatta's feet,
buttheBodhisatta restored ittotheKing,whom heestablished inthe
Five Precepts, beseeching him toshield allliving creatures from harm.
And theKing wasmoved bythese words togrant immunity toallliving

clayhehad sixbushels ofricecooked forthem and delicately flavoured,
and thiswasgiven tothecrows. But totheGreat Being there was
given foodsuch astheKing alone ate.

[487] ''Bad company."—This stoi-y was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about atraitorous Brother. The introductory incident isthe
same asthat toldintheMahila-mukha-jataka^.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasbornaniguana. When hegrewuphedwelt inabigburrow
intheriver bank with afollowing ofmany hundreds ofother iguanas.
Now theBodhisatta hadason,ayoung iguana, who Avasgreat friends
with achameleon, whom heiised toclipandembrace. Thisintimacy being
reported totheiguana king, hesent forhisyoung sonandsaidthatsuch
friendship wasmisplaced, forchameleons werelowcreatures, andthat ifthe
intimacy waspersisted in,calamity would befall thewhole ofthetribe of
iguanas. And heenjoined hissontohave nomore todowith the
chameleon. But thesoncontinued inhisintimacy. Again andagain
didtheBodhisatta speak with hisson,butfinding hiswords ofnoavail,
andforeseeing danger totheiguanas from thechameleon, hehadanoutlet
cutononeside oftheir burrow, sothatthere might beameans ofescape
intime ofneed.
Now astimewent on,theyoung iguana gi'ew toagreat size, whilst
thechameleon never grew any bigger. And asthese mountainous em-
braces oftheyoung giant grew painful indeed, thechameleon foresaw

thattheywould bethedeath ofhim iftheywent onafewdays longer,
andheresolved tocombine with ahunter todestroy thewhole tribe of
iguanas.
Onedayinthesummer theantscame outafter athunder-storm", and
[488] theiguanas darted hither andthither catching them and eating
them. Now there came intotheforest aniguana trapper withspade and
dogs todigoutiguanas ;and thechameleon thought what ahaulhe
would put inthetrappei''s way. Sohewent uptotheman, and, lying
down before him, asked why hewasabout inthe forest. "To catch
iguanas," was the reply, "Well, Iknow where there's aburrow of
hundreds ofthem," said thechameleon; "bring fireandbrushwood and
follow me."And hebrought thetrapper towhere theiguanas dwelt.
"Now," said thechameleon, "put your fuel inthere andsmoke the
iguanas out. Meantime letyour dogsbeallround andtakeabigstick in
your hand. Then astheiguanas dash out, strike themdown andmake a
pileoftheslain." Sosaying, thetreacherous chameleon withdrew toa
spothard by,where helaydown, with hishead up,saying tohimself,—
"ThisdayIshall seetheroutofmyenemy."
Thetrapper settowork tosmoke theiguanas out;andfear fortheir
lives drove them helter-skelter from their burrow. Astheycame out,the
trapper knocked them onthehead, and ifhemissed them, they fell
aprey tohisdogs. And sotherewasgreat slaughter among theiguanas.
Realising that thiswasthechameleon's doing, theBodhisatta cried, "One
should never make friends ofthewicked, forsuch bring sorrow intheir
train.Asingle wicked chameleon hasproved thebane ofallthese
iguanas." Sosaying, heescaped bytheoutlet hehadprovided, uttering
thisstanza:—
Badcompany cannever end ingood.
Through friendship withone solechameleon
The ti'ibe ofiaruanas met their end.
[489] Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Devadatta
wasthechameleon ofthose days; this traitorous Brother wasthedisobedient
young iguana, thesonoftheBodhisatta; and Imyself theking oftheiguanas."

''•Thy tightening grip."—This stoiy was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-gi'ove, about Devadatta's going about tokillhim. For, hearing the
Brethren talking together astothis intheHall ofTruth, theMaster said that,
asDevadatta acted now, soheacted intimes gone by,yetfailed—tohisown
grievous hurt—ofhiswicked purpose. And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn ajackal, anddwelt inacharnel-grove witli agreat
following ofjackals ofwhom hewasking. And atthattime tliere was

Bodhisatta came upandmarked thepretended corpse. Suspecting the
fraud, hedetermined tosiftthematter. Sohewent round totheleeside
andknew bythescent thatthemanwasnotreally dead. Resolving to
make theman look foolish before leaving him, theBodhisatta stole near
andtook hold oftheclubwith histeeth andtugged atit.The rascal
didnotleave go :notperceiving theBodhisatta's approach, he[490]
took atighter grip. Hereon theBodhisatta step2)ed back apace ortwo

"Voiirmangled corpseP—This story was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta's efforts topose asaBuddha atGayaslsa^.
Forwhen hisspiritual Insight lefthimandhelostthehonour andprofit which
oncewere his,heinhisperplexity asked theMaster toconcede theFive Points.
This being refused, hemade aschism intheBrotherhood anddeparted to
Gayaslsa with fivehundred young Brethren, pupils oftheBuddha's twochief
disciples, butasyetunversed intheLawandtheRule. With thisfollowing he
performed theactsofaseparate Brotherhood gathered together within thesame
precincts. Knowing wellthetimewhen theknowledge ofthese young Brethren
should ripen, theMaster sent thetwoElders tothem. Seeing these, [491]
Devadatta joyfully settowork expounding farinto thenight with (ashe
flattered himself) themasterly power ofaBuddha. Then posing asaBuddha
hesaid,"The assembly, reverend Sariputta, isstill alertand sleepless. Willyou

Said theMaster toSariputta, "What wasDevadatta doing when yougot
there1"And Sariputta answered that, though posing asaBuddha, evilhad
befallen him. SaidtheMaster, "Even asnow, Sariputta, soinformer times too
hasDevadatta imitated metohisown hurt." Then, attheElder's request, he
told thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasamaned lionanddwelt atGoldDen intheHimalayas.
Bounding forth onedayfrom his lair,helooked North andWest, South
andEast, androared aloud ashewent inquest ofprey. Slaying alarge
buffalo, hedevoured theprime ofthecarcass, afterwhich hewentdown to
apool, andhaving drunk his fillofcrystal water turned togotowards
hisden.Now ahungry jackal, suddenly meeting the lion,andbeing
unable tomake hisescape, threw himself atthelion's feet. Being asked
what hewanted, thejackal replied, "Lord, letmebethy servant."
"Very well," saidthelion; "serve meandyoushall feedonprime meat."
Sosaying, hewent with thejackal following toGold Den. Thenceforth
the lion's leavings felltothejackal, andhegrew fat.
Lying onedayinhisden,thelion toldthejackal toscan thevalleys
from themountain top, toseewhether there wereanyelephants orhorses
orbuffalos about, oranyother animals [492] ofwhich he,thejackal, was
fond. Ifanysuchwere insight, thejackal wastoreport andsaywithdue
obeisance, "Shine forth inthymight, Lord." Then thelionpromised to
killand eat,giving apart tothejackal. Sothejackal used toclimb the
heights, andwhenever heespied below beasts tohistaste, hewould report
ittothelion,andfalling athisfeet, say,"Shine forth inthymight, Lord."
Hereon thelionwould nimbly bound forth and slaythebeast, even ifit
were arutting elephant, andshare theprime ofthe cai'cass with the
jackal. Glutted with hismeal, thejackal would then retire tohisdenand
sleep.
Now astimewent on,thejackal grew bigger andbigger tillhegi-ew
haughty. "Have notItoofour legs'?" heasked himself. "Why amIa
pensioner daybydayonothers' bounty? Henceforth /will killelephants
andother beasts, formyown eating. The lion,king ofbeasts, only kills
them because oftheformula, 'Shine forth inthymight, Lord.' I'llmake
thelion callouttome,'Shine forth inthymight, jackal,' andthen I'llkill
anelephant formyself." Accordingly hewent tothe lion,andpointing
outthathehadlong lived onwhat thelionhad killed, told hisdesire to
eatanelephant ofhisown killing, ending with arequest tothelion tolet
him, thejackal, couch inthelion's corner inGoldDenwhilst thelionwas
toclimb themountain tolookoutforanelephant. Thequarry found, he
asked thatthelionshould come tohim inthedenand say,'Shine forth in

thymight, jackal.' Hebegged thelionnottogrudge him thismuch.
Said the lion, "Jackal, only lions can killelephants, norhastheworld
ever seen ajackal able tocopewiththem. Giveupthisfancy, andcon-
tinue tofeedonwhat Ikill." Butsaywhat thelion could, thejackal
would notgiveway,and still pressed hisrequest. Soatlastthelion
gave way,andbidding thejackal couch intheden,climbed thepeakand
thence espied anelephant inrut. Eeturning tothemouth ofthecave,
hesaid, "Shine forth inthymight, jackal." Then fromGoldDen the
jackal [493] nimbly bounded forth, looked around himonallfour sides,
and, thrice raising itshowl, sprang attheelephant, meaning tofasten on
itshead. Butmissing hisaim,healighted attheelephant's feet. The
infuriated brute raised itsright footandcrushed the jackal's head,
trampling thebones intopowder. Then pounding thecarcass intoamass,
anddunging upon it,theelephant dashed trumpeting into the forest.
Seeing allthis, theBodhisatta observed, "Now shine forth inthymight,
jackal," anduttered thisstanza:—
Your mangled corpse, your brains mashed into clay,
Prove howyou've shone forth inyoiu*might to-day.
Thus spake theBodhisatta, and living toagood oldagehepassed
away inthefulness oftime tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

theagedmen toldhow their kind benefactress was dead, andthattheywept
because theyhad lostherandshould never seeherlikeagain. Shocked atsuch
impropriety, theBrethren talked together intheHall ofTruth about thecause
oftheoldmen's sorrow, andthey toldtheMaster too,onhisentering theHall
andasking what theywere discussing. "Ah, Brethren," said he,"intimes past,
also, thissame woman's death made them goabout weeping andwailing; in
those days shewasacrowandwasdrowned inthesea,andthese were toiling
hard toempty allthewater outoftheseainorder togetherout,when the

And sosaying hetoldthisstoiy ofthepast.

Suddenly thethought struck them that they were stronger than the

saidhiswife. "Getsome otherwoman togotothefestival with you."
"Now whytorment melike this"?How arewetogetsafflowers]"
"Where there's awill, there's away," retorted thewoman. "Are

"Wife," said he,"the king's conservatories arelikeapoolhaunted
byanogre. There's nogetting inthere, withsuch astrong guard onthe

"Butwhen it'snight-time anddark," said she, "what's tostopaman's

Asshepersisted inherentreaties, hislove forheratlastmade him

''Once bitten, tioice shy."—This storywastoldbytheMaster when atJetavana,
about subduing desires.
Wearetoldthatsome fivehundred rich friends, sons ofmerchants ofSavatthi,
wei-e ledbylistening totheMaster's teachings togive their hearts totheTruth,
andthatjoining theBrotherhood they lived inJetavana inthepartthatAnatha-
piiidika paved with gold pieces laidsidebyside^
Now inthemiddle ofacertain night thoughts oflusttookhold ofthem, and,
intheir distress, they setthemselves tolayholdonceagain oftheluststheyhad
renounced. Inthathour theMaster raised aloft thelamp ofhisomniscience to
discover whatmanner ofpassion hadhold oftheBrethren inJetavana, and,
reading their hearts, perceived that lustanddesire hadsprung upwithin them.
Like asamother watches overheronly child, orasaone-eyed man iscareful of
theoneeyelefthim,even sowatchful istheMaster over hisdisciples;—atmorn
oreven, atwhatsoever hour their passions waragainst them, hewillnot lethis
faithful beoverpowered butinthatself-same hoursubdues theraging lusts that
beset them. Wherefore thethought came tohim, "This islikeaswhen thieves
break intothecityofanemperor ;Iwillunfold theTruth straightway tothese
Brethren, totheendthat,subduing their lusts, Imay raisethem toArahatship."
Sohecame forth from hisperfumed chamber, andinsweet tones called by
name forthevenerable Elder, Ananda, Treasiu-er oftheFaith. And theElder
cameandwithdueobeisance stood before theMaster toknow hispleasure. Then
theMaster badehimassemble together inhisperfumed chamber alltheBrethren
whodwelt inthatquarter ofJetavana. Tradition saysthattheMaster's thought
wasthat ifhesummoned onlythose fivehundred Brethren, theywould conclude
thathewasaware oftheir lustful mood, andwould bedebarred bytheir agitation
from receiving theTruth ;accordingly hesummoned alltheBrethren whodwelt
there. And theElder took akeyandwent from celltocellsummoning the
Brethren tillallwereassembled intheperfumed chamber. Then hemade ready
theBuddha-seat. Instately dignity likeMount Sineru resting onthesolid earth,
theMaster seated himself ontheBuddha-seat, making aglory shine round himof
paired garlands upon garlands ofsix-coloured light, which divided anddivided
intomasses ofthesizeofaplatter, ofthesizeofacanopy, andofthesizeofa
tower, until, likeshafts oflightning, theraysreached totheheavens above. It
waseven aswhen thesun rises, stirring theocean tothedepths.
With reverent obeisance andreverent hearts, theBrethren entered andtook
their seats around him,encompassing himasitwere within anorange curtain.
Then intones asofMaha-Brahma theMaster [502] said, "Brethren, aBrother

itbeimagined thatwicked desires areatrivial matter. Forsuch desires are

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasre-born into lifeasajackal anddwelt intheforest bythe
river-side. Nowanoldelephant diedbythebanks oftheGanges, andthe
jackal, finding thecarcass, congratulated himself onlighting upon such a
store ofmeat. Firsthebitthetrunk, butthatwas likebiting aplough-
handle. "There's noeating here," saidthejackal andtook abite ata
tusk. Butthatwaslikebiting bones. Then hetriedanear,butthatwas
likechewing therimofawinnowing-basket. Sohefelltoonthestomach,
butfound itastough asagrain-basket. Thefeetwerenobetter, forthey
were likeamortar. Next hetried the tail,butthatwaslikethepestle.
"That won't doeither," said thejackal; andhaving failed elsewhere to
findatoothsome part,hetried therearandfound that likeeating asoft
cake. "At last," said he,"I've found theright place," andatehisway
right intothebelly, where hemade aplenteous meal offthekidneys, heart
andtherest,quenching histhirst with theblood. Andwhen night came
on,helaydown inside. Ashelaythere, thethought came into the
jackal's mind, "This carcass isbothmeat andhouse tome,andwherefore
should Ileave itl" Sothere hestopped, anddwelt intheelephant's
inwards, eating away. Time wore on tillthesummer sunand the
summer winds dried andshrank theelephant's hide, [503] until the
entrance bywhich thejackal hadgotinwasclosed andtheinterior wasin
utter darkness. Thus thejackal was, asitwere, cutofffrom theworld
andconfined intheinterspace between theworlds. After thehide, the
flesh driedupandtheblood wasexhausted. Inafrenzy ofdespair, he
rushed toandfrobeating against hisprison walls inthefruitless endeavour
toescape. Bu.t ashebobbed upanddown inside likeaball ofriceina
boiling saucepan, soon atempest broke andthedownpour moistened the
shell ofthecarcass andrestored ittoitsformer state, tilllight shone like
astarthrough thewaybywhich thejackal hadgotin."Saved !saved!"
cried thejackal, and,backing intotheelephant's headmade arush head-first
attheoutlet. Hemanaged togetthrough, itistrue,butonlybyleaving
allhishairontheway.And firstheran,then hehalted, andthen sat
down andsurveyed hishairless body,nowsmooth asapalm-stem. "Ah!"

stanza:—
Once bitten, twice shy. Ah, gi'eat wasmyfear!
Ofelephants' inwards henceforth I'llsteer clear.
Andwith these words thejackal made off,nordidheever again so
much aslook either atthat oratanyother elephant's carcass. And
thenceforth liewasnever greedy again.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "Brethren, never letdesires take root in
theheart butpluckthem outwheresoever theyspring up." [504] Having preached
theFourTruths (attheclosewhereof those fivehundred Brethren wonArahatship
andtherestwonvarying lesser degrees ofsalvation), theMaster identified the

''Ifpoison lurk."—This storywastoldabout theLicchavi Prince Wicked of
Vesall bytheMaster when hewasliving inthegabled house inthegreat forest
near Vesali. Inthose days Vesali enjoyed marvellous prosperity. Atriple wall
encompassed thecity,each wallaleague distant from thenext,andthere were
three gates with watch-towers. Inthat citythere were always seven thousand
seven hundred andseven kings togovern thekingdom, andalikenumber of
viceroys, generals, and treasurers. Among thekings' sonswasoneknown as
Wicked Licchavi Prince, afierce, passionate and cruel young man, always
punishing, likeanenraged viper. Such was hispassionate nature thatno
onecould saymore than twoorthree words inhispresence; andneither
parents, kindred, norfriends could make him better. Soatlasthisparents
resolved tobring theimgovernable youth totheAll-WiseBuddha, realising that
none buthecould possibly tame their son's fierce spirit. Sotheybrought him
totheMaster, whom, withdueobeisance, they besought toreadtheyouth a

Then theMaster addressed theprince and said:—"Prince, human beings
should notbepassionate orcruel orferocious. The fierceman isonewho is

own rage, they arere-born intotorment. Sotootheywho injui-e others, are
hated even inthis lifeand shall fortheir sinspass atthebody's death tohell

sickness ofeyeandearandofevery kind everbesetthem from their birth onward.
Wherefore letallmenshew kindness andbedoers ofgood, andthen assuredly
hellandpunishment havenofears forthem."
Suchwasthepower ofthisonelecture upon theprince that hispridewas
humbled forthwith ;hisarrogance andselfishness passed fromhim,andhisheart
wasturned tokindness and love. Nevermore didherevile orstrike, butbecame
gentle asasnake withdrawn fangs, asacrabwithbroken claws, asabullwith
broken horns.
Marking thischange ofmood, theBrethren talked together intheHall of
Truth ofhowtheLicchavi Prince Wicked, whom theceaseless exhortations of
hisparents could notcurb, hadbeensubdued andhumbled with asingle ex-
hortation bytheAll-Wise Buddha, andhow thiswas liketaming sixrutting
elephants atonce. Wellhad itbeen said that,'The elephant- tamer, Brethren,
guides theelephant heisbreaking in,making ittogotoright orleft,backwaril

'Hethat ishailed aschief ofthetrainers ofmen,supreme inbowing men tothe
yoke ofTruths' "For, sirs," saidtheBrethren, "there isnotrainer ofmen like
unto theSupreme Buddha."
And here theMaster entered theHallandquestioned them astowliat they
were discussing. Then they toldhim,andhesaid, "Brethren, this isnotthe
firsttime thatasingle exhortation ofmine hasconquered theprince ;thelike
happened before."
And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattacame tolifeagain asabrahmin intheNortli country, andwhen he
grewuphefirstlearned theThree Vedas and alllearning, atTakkasihi, and
forsome time lived amundane life. Butwhen hisparents diedhebecame
arecluse, dwelling intheHimalayas, andattained themystic Attainments
andKnowledges. There hedwelt along time, tillneed ofsaltandother
necessaries oflifebrought himback tothepaths ofmen,andhecame to
Benares, where hetookuphisquarters intheroyal pleasaunce. Next day
hedressed himself with careandpains, and inthebestgarb ofanascetic
went inquest ofalms tothecity[506] andcame totheking's gate. The
kingwassitting down andsawtheBodhisatta from thewindow andmarked
within himself how thehermit, wise inheart and soul, fixing hisgaze
immediately before him,moved oninlion-like majesty, asthough atevery

footstep hewere depositing apurse ofathousand pieces. "Ifgoodness
dwell anywhere," thought theking, "itmust beinthisman's breast." So
summoning acourtier, hebadehimbring thehermit into thepresence.
And thecourtier wentuptotheBodhisatta andwithdueobeisance, took
hisalms-bowl from hishand. "How now, your excellency?" saidthe
Bodhisatta. "The king sends foryour reverence," replied thecourtier.
"My dwelling," saidtheBodhisatta, "isintheHimalayas, and Ihave not
theking's favour."
Sothecourtier wentbackandreported this totheking. Bethinking
him thathehadnoconfidential adviser atthetime, theking bade the
Bodhisatta bebrought, andtheBodhisatta consented tocome.
Theking greeted himonhisentrance with great courtesy andbadehim
beseated onagolden throne beneath aroyal parasol. And theBodhisatta
wasfedondainty foodwhich hadbeenmade ready fortheking's own
eating.
Then thekingasked where theascetic livedandlearned that hishome
wasintheHimalayas.
"And where areyougoingnow?"
"Insearch, sire, ofahabitation fortherainy season."
"Why nottakeupyourabode inmypleasaunce 1"suggested theking.
Then, having gained theBodhisatta's consent, andhaving eaten food
himself, hewent with hisguest tothepleasaunce andtherehadahermitage
built with acellfortheday,andacellforthenight. This dwelling was
provided with theeight requisites ofanascetic. Having thus installed the
Bodhisatta, thekingputhimunder thecharge ofthegardener andwent
back tothepalace. Soitcame topass that theBodhisatta dwelt thence-
forward intheking's pleasaunce, andtwice orthrice every daytheking
came tovisithim.
Now thekinghadafierce andpassionate sonwhowasknown as
Prince Wicked, whowasbeyond thecontrol ofhisfather and kinsfolk.
Councillors, brahmins and citizens allpointed outtotheyoung manthe
error ofhisways, butinvain.Hepaidnoheed totheir counsels. And
theking feltthattheonlyhope ofreclaiming hissonlaywith thevirtuous
ascetic. Soasalastchance [507] hetook theprince andhanded him
over totheBodhisatta todeal with. Then theBodhisatta^ walked with
theprince inthepleasaunce tilltheycame towhere aseedling Nimb tree
wasgrowing, onwhich asyetgrew buttwoleaves, oneonone side,oneon
theother.
"Taste aleafofthis little tree, prince," saidtheBodhisatta, "and see
what itislike."
Theyoungman didso ;butscarce hadheputtheleafinhismouth,
when hespat itoutwithanoath,andhawked andspat togetthetaste out
ofhismouth.

"What isthematter, prince?" asked theBodhisatta.
"Sir, to-day this treeonly suggests adeadly poison; but, ifleft to
grow, itwillprove thedeath ofmany persons," said theprince, and
forthwith plucked upandcrushed inhishands thetinygrowth, reciting
these lines:—
Ifpoison lurk inthebaby tree,
What willthe fullgrowth prove tobe?
Then saidtheBodhisatta tohim,"Prince, dreading what thepoisonous
seedling might grow to,youhave torn itupandrent itasunder. Even as
youacted tothetree, sothepeople ofthiskingdom, dreading what aprince
sofierce andpassionate maybecome when king, willnotplace youonthe
throne butuproot you like thisNimb treeanddrive youforth toexile.
Wherefore takewarning bythetreeandhenceforth shewmercy andabound
inloving-kindness."
From thathour theprince's mood waschanged. Hegrewhumble and
meek, merciful andoverflowing with kindness. Abiding bytheBodhisatta's
counsel, [508]when athisfather's death hecame tobeking, heabounded
incharity and other good works, and intheendpassed away tofare
accordins: tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "So, Brethren, this isnotthe firsttime
that Ihavetamed Prince Wicked;Ididthesame indays gone by."Then
heidentified theBirth bysaying, "The Licchavi Prince Wicked ofto-day was
thePrince Wicked ofthestory, Ananda theking,and Itheascetic whoexhorted

thegoodandvirtuous oldKing hisfather, whohadentered onthePaths, thereby
destroying hisownchance ofwinning likegoodness andvirtue, andbringing great
woeupon himself.
Hearing thattheearth hadswallowed upDevadatta, hefeared alike fate for
himself. Andsuchwasthefrenzy ofhisterror thatherecked notofhiskingdom's
welfare, slept notupon hisbed,butranged abroad quaking inevery limb, likea
young elei)hant inanagony ofpain. Infancy hesawtheearth yawning forhim,
andtheflames ofhelldarting forth ;hecould seehimself fastened down onabed
ofburning metal with ironlances being thrust into hisbody. Like awounded
cock, notforoneinstant washeatpeace. The desire came onhim tosee
theAll-Wise Buddha, tobereconciled tohim,and toaskguidance ofhim;
butbecause ofthemagnitude ofhistransgressions heshrank fromcoming into
theBuddha's presence. When theKattika festival came round, andbynight
Rajagaha wasilluminated andadorned likeacityofthegods, theKing, ashe
satonhighupon athrone ofgold, sawJivaka Komarabhacca sitting near.
Theideaflashed across hismind togowith Jivaka totheBuddha, buthefelt
hecould notsayoutright thathewould notgoalone butwanted Jivaka to
take him.No ;thebetter course would be,after praising thebeauty ofthe
night, [509] topropose sitting a1>thefeetofsome sage orbrahmin, and toask
thecourtiers what teacher cangive theheart peace. Ofcourse, theywould
severally praise theirown masters ;butJivaka would besure toextol the
All-Enlightened Buddha; and totheBuddha theKing with Jivaka wovild go.
Soheburst into fivefold praises ofthenight, saying—"How fair, sirs, isthis
clear cloudless night !How beautiful !Howcharming !How delightful !How
lovely 1!What sage orbrahmin shallweseek out,toseeifhaply hemay give
ourhearts peace?"
Then oneminister recommended Purana Kassapa, another Makkhali Gosala,
andothers again Ajita Kesakambala, Kakudha Kaccayana, Saiijaya Belatthi-
putta, orNigantha Nathaputta. Allthese names theKing heard insilence,
waiting forhischief minister, Jivaka, tospeak. But Jivaka, suspecting that
theKing's realobject wastomakehimspeak, kept silence inorder tomake sure.
AtlasttheKing said, "Well,mygood Jivaka, whyhaveyounothing tosay?"
Attheword Jivaka arose from hisseat,andwithhands clasped inadoration
towards theBlessed One, cried, "Sire,yonder inmymango-grove dwells the
All-Enlightened Buddha with thirteen hundred and fiftyBrethren. This isthe
highfame thathasarisen concerning him." And hereheproceeded torecite
thenine titles ofhonour ascribed tohim,beginning with'Venerable^.' When
hehadfurther shewn howfrom hisbirth onwards theBuddha's powers had
surpassed alltheearlier presages andexpectations, Jivaka said, "Unto him, the
Blessed One, lettheKing repair, tohear thetruth andtoputquestions."
Hisobject thus attained, theKing asked Jivaka tohave theelephants got
ready andwent inroyal state toJivaka's mango-grove, where hefound inthe
perfumed pavilion theBuddha amid theBrotherhood which wastranquil asthe
ocean inperfect repose. Look where hewould, theKing's eyesawonly the
endless ranks oftheBrethren, exceeding innumbers anyfollowing hehadever
seen. Pleased with thedemeanour oftheBrethren, theKing bowed lowand
spoke words ofpraise. Then saluting theBuddha, heseated himself, and
asked himthequestion, 'What isthe fruit ofthereligious life?' And the
Blessed Onegave utterance totheSamaiiiiaphala Sutta intwo sections^. Glad
atheart, theKingmade hispeace with theBuddha attheclose oftheSutta,

oftheir converse. Being told, theMaster said, "This isnotthe first time,
Brethren, thatAjatasattu hassuffered forfavouring thesinful;likeconduct in

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into thefamily ofawealthy brahmin. Arriving at
years ofdiscretion, hewent tostudy atTakkasila, where hereceived a
complete education. InBenares asateacher heenjoyed world-wide fame
andhad fivehundred young brahmins aspupils. Among these wasone
named SaiijTva, towhom theBodhisatta taught thespell forraising the
dead tolife. Butthough theyoung manwastaught this,hewasnot
taught thecounter charm. Proud ofhisnewpower, hewent with his
fellow-pupils totheforest wood-gathei-ing, andtherecame onadead tiger,
'*Now seemebring thetiger tolifeagain," said he.
"You can't," saidthey.
"You lookandyou willseemedoit."
"Well, ifyoucan,doso,"saidtheyandclimbed upatreeforthwith.
Then SaiijTva repeated hischarm andstruck thedead tiger with a
potsherd. Upstarted thetiger andquick aslightning sprang atSanjiva
and bithimonthethi'oat, killing himoutright. Dead fellthetiger then
andthere, anddead fellSanjiva tooatthesame spot. Sothere thetwo
laydead sidebyside.
Theyoung brahmins took theirwood andwent back totheirmaster to
whom they toldthestory. "Mydear pupils," said he,"mark herein how
byreason ofshowing favour tothesinful andpaying honour where itwas
notdue,hehasbrought allthiscalamity upon himself." And sosaying he
uttered thisstanza:—
[511] Befriend avillain, aidhim inhisneed,
And, likethat tigerwhich Sanjiva^ raised
To life,hestraight devours you foryour pains.
^Unlike thepreceding sentence, this lastsentence does notoccur intheDigha
Nikaya. Theinterpolation isinteresting assuggesting thelicense withwhich words
wereputintotheMaster's mouth byBuddhist authors.
-Thegloss suggests that sanjlviko(='oforbelonging toSanjiva') isanacridpun
onthemeaning ofSanjlvo, which means 'alive,'—thetigerhaving been restored tolife
bySanjiva, whom itbereft oflifebyway ofreward.
