156 TlieJataka. Book I.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta, whohadchosen ananchorite's life,built himself ahermitage
bythebanks oftheGanges, andtherewon theAttainments andthe
Higher Knowledges, andsodwelt inthebliss ofInsight. Inthose days
theLordHigh Treasurer ofBenares hadatierce and cruel daughter,
known asLady Wicked, whoused torevile andbeatherservants and
slaves. And onedaythey took theiryoung mistress [296] todisport
herself intheGanges ;andthe girls were playing about inthewater,
when thesun setand agreat storm burst upon them. Hereon folks
scampered away, and the girl's attendants, exclaiming, "Now isthe
time toseethelast ofthis creature!"threw herright into theriver
andhurried oflf.Down poured therain intorrents, thesun set,and
darkness came on.Andwhen theattendants reached home without
theiryoung mistress, andwere asked where shewas,they replied thatshe
hadgotoutoftheGanges butthattheydidnotknow where shehadgone.
Search wasmade byherfamily, butnotatrace ofthemissing girlcould
befound.
Meantime she,screaming loudly, wasswept down bytheswollen
stream, and atmidnight approached where theBodhisatta dwelt in liis
hermitage. Hearing her cries, hethought tohimself, "That's awoman's
voice. Imust rescue herfrom thewater." Sohetook atorch ofgrass
andby itslight desci'ied herinthestream. "Don't beafraid ;don't
beafraid!"heshouted cheerily, andwaded in,and,thanks tohisvast
strength, asofanelephant, brought her safe toland. Then hemade
afire forherinhishermitage and setluscious fruits ofdivers kinds
before her.Not tillshehadeaten didheask,"Where isyourhome, and
howcame you tofallintheriver?" And the girl toldhim allthat
hadbefallen her. "Dwell here forthepresent," said he,and installed
herinhishermitage, whilst forthenexttwo orthree days hehimself
abode intheopen air.Attheend ofthattime hebade herdepart, but
shewassetonwaiting tillshehadmade theascetic fallinlovewith her;
andwould notgo.And astimewent by,shesowrought onhimbyher

Now theborder washarried byrobbers from themountains ;andthey
made aI'aidoneday[297] onthevillage where thepair lived, andlooted
it.Theymade thepoor villagers pack uptheir belongings, and offthey
went—with theTreasurer's daughter among therest—totheirownabodes.
Arrived there, they leteverybody elsegofree ;butthe girl,because ofher
beauty, wastaken towifebytherobber chieftain.
Andwhen theBodhisatta learned this,hethought tohimself, "Shewill
notendure toliveaway from me.She willescape andcome back tome."
And sohelived on,waiting forhertoreturn. Shemeantime wasvery
happy with therobbers, andonly feared that theDate-sage would come to
carry heraway again. "Ishould feelmore secure," thought she, "ifhe
were dead. Imust send amessage tohimfeigning loveandsoentice him
here tohisdeath." Soshesent amessenger tohimwith themessage
thatshewasunhappy, andthatshewanted him totakeheraway.
And he,inhisfaith inher, setoutforthwith, andcame tothe
entrance oftherobbers' village, whence hesent amessage toher. "To

chieftain's hands whowould killusboth. Letusput offour flight

robber camehome atnight andwasinflamed with strong drink, shesaid
tohim, "Tellme, love,what would youdoifyour rival were inyour
power1"
Andhesaidhewould dothisandthat tohim.
"Perhaps heisnotsofaraway asyou think," said she. "He is
inthenext I'oom."
Seizing atorch, therobber rushed inand seized theBodhisatta and
beathimabout theheadandbody tohisheart's content. Amid theblows
theBodhisatta made nocry,onlymurmuring, "Cruel ingrates !slanderous
traitors!"And thiswas allhesaid.Andwhen hehadthus beaten,
bound, and laidbythe heels theBodhisatta, therobber finished his
supper, andlaydown tosleep. Inthemorning, when hehad sle[)t ofi"his
over-night's debauch, hefellanew tobeating theBodhisatta, who stillmade

struck with thisandasked why, evenwhen beaten, hekept saying
that. [298]

This settherobber a-thinking again, andhethought, "Ifshecanfeel

Bodhisatta andhaving awakened thewoman, hesetoutsword inhand,
pretending toherthathewasabout tokillhimoutside the village. Then
bidding herhold theDate-Sage hedrew hissword, and,making asthough
tokillthesage, clove thewoman intwain. Then hebathed theDate-
Sagefrom head tofootand forseveral days fedhimwith dainties tohis
heart's content.
"Where doyoupurpose togonow 1"saidtherobber atlast.
"The world," answered thesage, "has nopleasures forme. Iwill
become ahermit oncemore anddwell inmyformer habitation inthe
forest."
"And Itoowillbecome ahermit," exclaimed therobber. Soboth
became hermits together, anddwelt inthehermitage intheforest, where
theywon theHigher Knowledges andtheAttainments, and qualified
themselves when lifeended toenter theRealm ofBrahma.
After telling these two stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion, byreciting,
asBuddha, thisstanza:—
Wrathful arewomen, slanderers, ingrates.
Thesowers ofdissension and fell strife !
Then, Brother, tread thepath ofholiness,
And Bliss therein thou shalt not failtofind.
[299]Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theTruths, attheclosewhereof
thepassion-tost Brother wontheFruit oftheFirst Path. Also, theMaster
identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wastherobber-chief ofthose days, and
Imyself theDate-Sage."

"ThinFst thou."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about alay-brother. Tradition says that there dwelt atSavatthi alay-brother,
whowasstablished intheThreeGems andtheFiveCommandments, adevout
lover oftheBuddha, theDoctrine andtheBrotherhood. But hi«wifewasa
sinful andwicked woman. Ondayswhen shedidwrong, shewasasmeek asa

wrong, sheplayedmylady, passionate andtyrannical. Thehusband could not
make herout. Sheworried him somuch thathedidnotgotowait onthe
Buddha.
Onedayhewent withperfumes andflowers, andhadtaken hisseat afterdue
salutation, when theMaster said tohim:—"Prayhowcomes it,lay-brother,
thatseven oreight dayshave gonebywithout yourcoming towaitupon the
Buddha]" "My wife, sir, isoneday likeaslave-girl bought forahundred
pieces, while another dayfinds herlikeapassionate andtyrannical mistress. I
cannot make herout ;and itisbecause shehasworried mesothat Ihavenot
been towaitupon theBuddha."
Now,when heheard these words, theMaster said,"Why, lay-brother, you
have already been told l)ythewiseandgood ofbygone days that itishard to
understand thenature ofwomen." Andhev/ent ontoadd"but hisprevious
existences havecome tobeconfused inhismind, sothathecannot remember."
And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tobeateacher ofworld-wide fame, with fiveliundred
young brahmins studying under liira. [300] One ofthese pupils was
ayoung brahmin from aforeign land,who fellinlovewith awoman
andmade her liiswife. Though hecontinued toliveoninBenares,
hefailed two orthree times inhisattendance onthemaster. For,
youshould know, hiswifewas asinful andwicked woman, whowas
asmeek asaslave ondayswhen shehaddone wrong, butondayswhen
shehadnotdonewrong, playedmylady, passionate andtyrannical. Her
husband could notmake heroutatall ;andsoworried andharassed by
lierwashethatheabsented him.self from waiting ontheMaster. Now,
some seven oreight days laterherenewed hisattendances, andwasasked
bytheBodhisatta whyhehadnotbeen seen oflate.
"Master, mywife isthecause," said he.AndhetoldtheBodhisatta
howshewasmeek onedaylikeaslave-girl, andtyrannical thenext; how
hecould notmake heroutatall,andhowhehadbeen soworried and
harassed byhershifting moods thathehadstayed away.
"Precisely so,young brahmin," saidtheBodhisatta; "ondayswhen
theyhavedone wrong, women humble themselves before their husbands
andbecome asmeek andsubmissive asaslave-girl ;butondayswhen
theyhave notdonewrong, thentheybecome stiff-necked andinsubordinate
totheir lords. After thismanner arewomen sinful andwicked;andtheir
nature ishard toknow. Noheed should bepaid either totheir likes or
totheir dislikes." And sosaying, theBodhisatta repeated fortheedifica-
tion ofhispupil thisStanza:—
Think'st thou awoman loves thee ?—benotglad.
Think'st thou sheloves thee not ?—forbear togrieve.
Unknowable, uncertain asthepath
Offishes inthewater, women prove.

[301] SuchwastheBodhisatta's instruction tohispupil, whothence-
forward paidnoheed tohiswife's caprices. And she,hearing thather
misconduct hadcome totheears oftheBodhisatta, ceased from thattime
forward from hernaughtiness.
Sotoothis lay-brother's wife said toherself, "The Perfect Buddha himself
knows, they tellme,ofmymisconduct," andthenceforth shesinned nomore.
Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theTruths, attheclosewhereof the

"Lay-brother," saidtheMaster, "longagothewiseandgood toldyounotto

this, however, youhave forgotten, because re-birth hashidden itfrom you."
And sosaying, lietold—atthat lay-brother's request—thisstory ofthepast.

"TillOentle-heart wasmine"—This story wastoldbytheMaster while at
Jetavaua, about concupiscence. Tradition says that ayoung gentleman of
Savatthi, [303] onhearing theTruth preached bytheMaster, gave hisheart to
theDoctrine oftheThree Gems. Renouncing theworld fortheBrother's life,
herose towalk inthePaths, topractise meditation, andnever toslacken inhis
pondering over thetheme hehadchosen forthought. Oneday, whilst hewas
onhisround foralms through Savatthi, heespied awoman inbrave attire, and,
forpleasure's sake, broke through thehigher morality andgazed upon her!
Passion wasstirred within him,hebecame even asafig-tree felled bytheaxe.
From thatday forth, imder thesway ofpassion, thepalate ofhismind, asof
hisbody, lost allitsgust; likeabrute beast, hetooknojoyintheDoctrine, and
suffered hisnailsandhairtogrow longandhisrobes togrow foul.
When hisfriends among theBrethren became aware ofhistroubled state of
mind, they said,"Why, sir, isyour moral state otherwise than itwas?" "My
joyhasgone," said he.Then theytookhimtotheMaster, whoasked themwhy
theyhadbrought thatBrother there against hiswill. "Because, sir,hisjoyis
gone." "Isthat true, Brother?" "It is,Blessed One." "Who hastroubled
you?" "Sir, Iwasonmyround foralms when, violating thehigher morality,
Igazed onawoman;andpassion was stirred within me. Therefore am I

troubled." Then said theMaster, "Itislittle marvel, Brother, thatwhen,
violating morality, youwere gazing forpleasure's sakeonanexceptional object,
youwere stirred byj^assion. Why, inbj'gone times, even thosewhohadwon
thefiveHigher Knowledges andtheeight Attainments, thosewhobythemight
ofInsight hadquelled their passions, whose hearts were purified andwhose feet
could walk the skies, yeaeven Bodhisattas, through gazing inviolation of
morality onanexceptional object, losttheir insight, were stirred bypassion, and
came togreat sorrow. Little recks thewind which could overturn Mount

passion beabashed before 3'ou 1Why, even piu'ified Ijeings areledastray by
passion, andthose advanced tothehighest honoiir, come toshame." And so
saying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into arichbrahmin family intheKasi country.
When hewasgrown upandhadfinished hiseducation, herenoimced all
Lusts, and,forsaking theworld forthehermit's life,went tolive inthe
solitudes oftheHimalayas. There byduefulfilment ofallpreparatory
forms ofmeditation, hewonbyabstract thought theHigher Knowledges
andtheecstatic Attainments ;andsolived his lifeinthebliss ofmystic
Insight.
[304] Lack ofsaltandvinegar brought himonedaytoBenares, where
hetookuphisquarters intheking's pleasaunce. Next day, after seeing
tohisbodily needs, hefolded uptheredsuitofbai-kwhich hecommonly
wore, threw overoneshoulder ablack antelope's skin, knotted histangled
locks inacoilonthetopofhishead, andwith ayokeonhisbackfrom
which hung twobaskets, setoutonhisround inquest ofalms. Coming
tothepalace-gates onhisway, hisdemeanour socommended him tothe
king that hismajesty hadhimbrought inSotheascetic wasseated ona
couch ofgreat splendour and fedwith abundance ofthedaintiest food.
Andwhen hethanked theking, hewasinvited totakeuphisdwelling
inthepleasaunce. The ascetic accepted the offer, and forsixteen years
abode inthepleasaunce, exhorting theking's household andeating ofthe
king's meat.
Now there came adaywhen thekingmust gototheborders toput
down arising. But, before hestarted, hecharged hisqueen, whose name
wasGentle-heart, tominister tothewants oftheholyman. So,after
theking's departure, theBodhisatta continued togowhen hepleased to
thepalace.
OnedayQueen Gentle-heart gotready ameal fortheBodhisatta; but

and layclown, awaiting hiscoming, onalittle couch inthespacious
chamber.
Waking from rapture ofInsight, andseeing how late itwas, the
Bodhisatta transported himself through theairtothepalace. Heai'ing
therustling ofhisbark-robe, thequeen started uphurriedly toreceive
him. Inherhurry torise,hertunic slipped down, sothat herbeauty
wasrevealed totheascetic asheentered thewindow ;andatthesight, in
violation ofMorality hegazed forpleasure's sake onthemarvellous
beauty ofthequeen. Lustwaskindled within him;hewas asatree
felled bytheaxe.Atonce allInsight deserted him,andhebecame
asacrow with itswings clipped. Clutching hisfood, stillstanding, he
atenot,buttook hisway, alla-tremble with desire, from thepalace tohis
hutinthepleasaunce, set itdown beneath hiswooden couch andthereon
layforseven whole days aprey tohunger and thirst, enslaved bythe
queen's loveliness, hisheart aflame with lust.
Ontheseventh day, thekingcame Imckfrom pacifying theborder.
After passing insolemn procession round the city,heentered hispalace.
[30.'i] Then, wishing toseetheascetic, hetook hisway tothepleasaunce,
andthere inthe cellfound theBodhisatta lyiug onhiscouch. Thinking
theholymanhadbeen taken ill,theking, after firsthaving the cell
cleaned out, asked, ashestroked the sufferer's feet,what ailed him.
"Sire,myheart isfettered bylust; that ismysoleailment." "Lust for
whom 1""For Gentle-heart, sire." "Then she isyours;Igive her
toyou," saidtheking. Then hepassed with theascetic tothepalace, and
bidding thequeen array herself inallhersplendour, gave hertothe
Bodhisatta. But, ashewasgiving heraway, theking privily charged the
queen toputforth herutmost endeavour tosave theholyman.
"Fear not, sire," said thequeen ;"Iwillsave him." Sowith the
queen the ascetic went outfrom thepalace. Butwhen hehadpassed
through thegreat gate, thequeen cried outthattheymust have ahouse

Hereon hecame tohimself after hisinterval ofwitless folly.
(And hereshould berepeated thetextbeginning, "Thus thehindrances
ofLustandLonging arecalled Evils because they spring from Ignorance,
Brethren;[306] thatwhich springs from Ignorance creates Darkness.")
Sowhen hehadcome tohimself, hebethought himhow,waxing
stronger andstronger, this fatal craving would condemn himhereafter to
theFour States ofPunishment'. "This self-same day," hecried, "will I
restore thiswoman tothekingand flytothemountains!"Sohestood

TillGentle-heart wasmine, one sole desire
Ihad,—towin her.When herbeaiity owned
Melord, desire came crowding ondesire.
Forthwith hislostpower ofInsight came back tohim. Rising from

"Theman thymind rests on."—This story wastoldbytheMaster, while at

Onewith hisdisciples wasentering thecityofSfiketa, anoldbrahmin ofthat

after sixweeks' zealous application tohigh thinking, fellunder thedominion of
Lusts and oft'liewent. Hisbelly again proving toomuch forhim, [312] backhe
came tojoin theBrotherhood once more, andstudied theAbhidhammai. In
thisway, sixtimes heleftandcame back again;butwhen fortheseventh time
hebecame aBi-other, hemastered thewhole seven books oftheAVjhidhamma,
andbymuch chanting oftheDoctrine oftheBrothers wonDiscernment and
attained toArahatship. Now hisfriends among theBrethren scoffed athim,
saying—"Can itbe, sir,that Lusts have ceased tospring upwithin your
heart/"
"Sirs," wasthereply, "Ihavenowgotbeyond mundane lifehenceforth."
Hehaving thuswonArahatship, talkthereof arose intheHall ofTruth, as
follows:—"Sirs, thougli allthewhile hewasdestined toalltheglories ofArahat-
ship, yetsixtimes did(Jittahattha-Sariputta renounce theBrotherhood;truly,
verywrong istheunconverted state."
Returning totheHall, theMaster asked what they were talking about.
Being told,hesaid, "Brethren, theworldling's heart islightandhard tocurb;
material things attract andhold itfast;when once itissoheld fast, itcannot
bereleased inatrice. Excellent isthemasteiy ofsuchaheart ;oncemastered,
itbrings joyandhappiness:—
'Tisgood totame aheadstrong heart and frail.
Bypassicm swayed. Once tamed, theheart brings bliss.
Itwasbyreason ofthisheadstrong quality oftheheart, however, that, forthe
sake ofapretty spade which they could notbring themselves tothrow away, the
wiseandgood ofbygone days sixtimes reverted totheworld outofsheer
cupidity;butontheseventh occasion theywon Insight andsubdued their
cupidity." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asagardener, andgrew up.'Spade Sage'
was hisname. With hisspade hecleared apatch ofground, andgrew
pot-herbs, pumpkins, gourds, cucumbers, andother vegetables, bythesale
ofwhich hemade asorry living. For, saveonly thatonespade, hehad
nothing intheworld !Resolving oneday toforsake theworld forthe
religious life,hehidhisspade away, andbecame arecluse. Butthoughts
ofthatspade roseinhisheart andthepassion ofgi-eed overcame him, so
that forthesake ofhisblunt spade hereverted totheworld. [313] Again
andagain thishappened ;sixtimes didhehide thespade andbecome a
recluse,—only torenounce hisvows again. Buttheseventh time he
bethought himhowthatblunt spade hadcaused himagain andagain to
backslide ;andhemade uphismind tothrow itinto agreat river before
hebecame arecluse again. Sohecarried thespade totheriver-side, and,
fearing lest ifhesawwhere itfell,heshould come back and fish itout
again, hewhirled thespade thrice round hisheadbythehandle andflung

tight ashedid so.Then loudrang hisshout ofexultation, ashout likea
lion's I'oai',—"Ihave conquered !Ihaveconquered!"
Now just atthatmoment theKing ofBenares, onhiswayhome from
quelling disorder ontheborder, hadbeen bathing inthatvery rivei", and
wasriding along inallhissplendour ontheback ofhiselephant, when he
heard theBodhisatta's shout oftriumph. "Here's aman," saidtheking,
"who isproclaiming thathehasconquered. Iwonder whom hehas
conquered. Go,bringhimbefore me."
SotheBodhisatta wasbrought before theking,who saidtohim, "My
goodman, Iamaconqueror myself; Ihave justwonabattle andamon
mywayhome victorious. Tellmewhom youhave conquered." "Sire,"
saidtheBodhisatta, "athousand, yea,ahundred thousand, such victories
asyours arevain, ifyouhave notthevictory over theLusts within your-
self. Itisbyconquering greed within myself thatIhaveconquered my
Lusts." And ashespoke, hegazed upon thegreat river, andbyduly
concentrating allhismindupon theidea ofwater, won Insight. Then by
virtue ofhisnewly-won transcendental powers, herose inthe air,and,
seated there, instructed theKing intheTruth inthisstanza:—
Theconquest thatbyfurther victories
Must beupheld, orown defeat atlast,
Isvain !True conquest lasts forevermore !
[314]Even ashelistened totheTruth, light shone inontheking's
darkness, andtheLusts ofhisheart were quenched ;hisheart wasbent
onrenouncing theworld ;then andthere thelust forroyal dominion
passed away from him. "Andwhere willyougonow 1"saidtheking to
theBodhisatta. "To theHimalayas, sire; there tolivetheanchorite's
life." "Then I,too, willbecome ananchorite," said theking; andhe
departed with theBodhisatta. And with theking there departed alsothe
whole army, allthebrahmins andhouseholders and allthecommon folk,—inawoi'd, allthehost thatwasgathered there.
Tidings came toBenares that their king, onhearing theTruth preached
bytheSpade Sage, wasfain tolivetheanchorite's lifeandhadgone forth
with allhishost."And what shallwedohere?" cried thefolkofBenares.
And thereupon, from outthat citywhich wastwelve leagues about, allthe
inhabitants went forth, atrain twelve leagues long, withwhom theBodhi-
satta passed totheHimalayas.
Then thethrone ofSakka, King ofDevas, became hotbeneath him '.

Renunciation'. Marking thenumbers ofhisfollowing, Indra tookthought
how tohouse them all.Andhesent forVissakamma, thearchitect ofthe
Devas, andspoke thus:—"TheSpade Sage isengaged upon aGreat
Renunciation, [315] andquarters must befound forhim. Goyoutothe
Himalayas, andthere onlevelground fashion bydivine power ahermit's
demesne thirty leagues longand fifteen broad."
"Itshall bedone, sire," saidVissakamma. Andaway hewent, and
didwhat hewasbidden.
(What follows isonlyasummary ;thefulldetails willbegiven inthe
Hatthipala-jritaka'-, which forms onenarrative with this.) Vissakamma
caused ahermitage toarise inthehermit's demesne ;drove away allthe
noisy beasts andbirdsand fairies ;andmade ineach cardinal direction a
path justbroad enough foroneperson topassalong itatatime. This
done, hebetook himself tohisownabode. TheSpade Sage with hishost
ofpeople came totheHimalayas andentered thedemesne which Indra
hadgiven andtook possession ofthehouse andfurniture which Vissa-
kamma hadcreated forthehermits. First ofall,herenounced theworld
himself, andafterwards made thepeople renounce it.Then heportioned
outthedemesne among them. They abandoned alltheir sovereignty, which
rivalled that ofSakka himself; and thewhole thirty leagues ofthe
demesne were filled. Bydueperformance ofalltheother^ rites that
conduce toInsight, theSj)ade Sage developed perfect good-will within
himself, andhetaught thepeople how tomeditate. Hereby they all
wontheAttainments, andassured their entry thereafter intotheBrahma-
Realm, whilst allwho ministered tothem qualified forentry thereafter
intotheRealm ofDevas.
"Thus, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "the heart, when passion holds itfast, is
hard torelease. When theattributes ofgreed spring upwithin it,they arehard
tochase away, andeven persons sowiseandgood astheabove arethereby
rendered witless." His lesson ended, hepreached theTruths, attheclose
whereof somewontheFirst, some theSecond, andsome theThird Path, whilst
others again attained toArahatship. Further, theMaster shewed thecon-
nexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wastheking ofthose
days, theBuddha's followers were thefollowers, and Imyself theSpade Sage."

[316] ''Learn thoufrom him."—This .story wastoldbytheMaster while at
Jetavaiia, about theElder named Tissa the.Squire's Son. Tradition saysthat
onedaythirty young gentlemen ofSavatthi, whowere allfriends ofoneanother,
tookperfumes andflowers and robes, and setoutwith alarge retimie toJeta-
vana, inorder toheartheMaster preach. Ai-rivcd atJetavana, they satawhile
intheseveral enclosures —intheenclosure oftheIron-wood trees, inthe
enclosure ofthe ISal-trees, andsoforth,—tillatevening theMaster passed from
hisfragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber totheHall ofTruth andtook his
seatonthegorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, theseyoung men
went totheHall ofTruth, made anollering ofperfumes and flowers, bowed
down athisfeet—tho.se ble.ssed feetthatwere glorious asfull-blown lotus-dowers,
andboreimprinted onthesoletheWheel!—and, taking their .seats, listened
totheTruth. Then thethought came into their minds, "Let ustake thevows,
sofarasweunderstand theTruth preached bytheMaster." Accoixlingly, when
the Bles.sed One lefttheHall, they approtiched himandwithdueobeLsance
asked tobeadmitted totheBrotherhood ;andtheMaster admitted them tothe
Brotherhood. Winning thefavour oftheir teachers anddirectors they received
fullBrotherhood, andafterhveyears' residence with their teachers anddirectors,
bywhich timetheyhadgotbyheart thetwoAlistracts, hadcome toknow what
wasproper andwhat wasimpi-oper, hadlearnt the thi'ee modes ofexpressing
thanks, andhadstitched andtlyed robes. Atthisstage, wishing toembrace the
ascetic life,they obtained theconsent oftheir teachers and directors, and
approached theMaster. Bowing before himtheytook their seats, saying, "Sir,
wearetroubled bytheround ofexistence, dismayed bybirth, decay, disease, and
death;giveusatheme, bythinking onwhich wemaygetfreefrom theelements
which occasion existence." TheMaster turned over inhismind theeight and
thirty themes ofthought, andtherefrom selected asuitable one,which he
expounded tothem. And then, after getting theirtheme from theMaster, they
bowed andwith aceremonious farewell passed from hispresence totheir cells,
and after gazing ontheir teachers anddirectors went forth withbowlandrobe
toembrace theascetic life.
Nowamongst them wasaBrother named theElder Tissa theSquire's Son,
aweakand irre.solute man, aslave tothepleasures ofthetaste. Thought heto
himself, "1shall never beable toliveintheforest, tostrive with strenuous
effort, andsubsist ondoles offood. What isthegood ofmygoing? Iwillturn
back." And sohegave up,andafteraccompanying those Brothers somewayhe
turned back. Astotheother Brothers, theycame inthecourse oftheir alms-
pilgrimage through Kosala toacertain border- village, [317] hardbywhich ina
wooded spotthey kept theKainy-season, andbythree months' striving and
wrestling gotthegeim ofDiscernment andwonArahatship, making theearth
shout forjoy.AttheendoftheKainy-season, after celebi'ating thePavarana
festival, they setoutthence toannounce totheMaster theattainments they
hadwon, and,coming induecom-se toJetavana, laidaside their bowls and
robes, paidavisit totheir teachers anddirectors, and,being anxious toseethe
Blessed One,went tohimandwithdueobeisance took their seats. TheMaster
greeted them kindly andtheyannoimced totheBlessed Onetheattainments
theyhadwon, receiving praise from him. Hearing theMaster speaking intheir
praise, theElder Tissa theSquire's Sonwas filled with adesire tolivethe life
ofarecluse allbyhimself. Likewise, those other Brothers asked andreceived
theMaster's pernii.ssion toretm-n todwell inthatself-same spot intheforest.
Andwithdueobei.sancc theywent totheir cells.

Now theElder Tissa theSquire's Sonthatvery night was inflated with a
yearning tobegin hisausterities atonce,andwhilst practising with excessive
zealandardour themethods ofarecluse andsleeping inanupright posture by
theside ofhisplank-bed, soon after themiddle watch ofthenight, round he
turned anddown he fell,breaking histhigh-bone; andsevere pains set in,so
thattheother Brothers hadtonurse himandweredebarred from going.
Accordingly, when theyappeared atthehour forwaiting ontheBuddha, he
asked them whether they laadnotyesterday asked hisleave tostart to-day.
"Yes, sir,wedid;butourfriend theElder Tissa theSquire's Son, while
rehearsing themethods ofarecluse with great vigour butoutofseason, dropped
ofl'tosleepand fellover, breaking histhigh ;andthat iswhyourdeparture has
been thwarted." "This isnotthe first time, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "that
thisman's backsliding hascaused him tostrive with unseasonable zeal,and
thereby todelay your departure; hedelayed your departure inthepast also."
Andhereupon, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatime atTakkasila inthekingdom ofGandhara theBodhisatta
wasateacher ofworld-wide fame, with 500young brahmins aspupils.
Onedaythese pupils setoutfortheforest togather firewood fortheir
master, andbusied themselves ingathering sticks. Amongst them wasa
lazy fellow whocame onahuge forest tree,which heimagined tobedry
and rotten. Sohethought thathecould safely indulge inana|) first,and
atthe lastmoment climb up[318] andbreak some branches offtocarry
home. Accordingly, hespread outhisouter robeand fellasleep, snoring
loudly. Alltheotheryoung brahmins were ontheirwayhome with their
wood tiedupinfaggots, when theycame upon thesleeper. Having
kicked him intheback tillheawoke, they lefthimandwent their way.
Hesprang tohisfeet,andrubbed hiseyes foratime. Then, still half
asleep, hebegan toclimb the tree. Butonebranch, which hewas
tugging at,snapped offshort ;and, asitsprang up,theendstruck himin
theeye. Clapping onehand over hiswounded eye,hegathered green
boughs with theother. Then climbing down, hecorded hisfaggot, and
afterhurrying awayhome with it,flung hisgreen wood onthetopofthe
others' faggots.
Thatsameday itchanced that acountry family invited themaster to
visitthem onthemorrow, inorder thatthey miglit give liim abrahmin-
feast.And sothemaster called liispupils together, and, telling them ofthe
journey theywould have tomake tothevillage onthemorrow, saidthey
could notgofasting. "Sohave some rice-gruel made early inthe
morning," saidhe ;"andeat itbefore starting. There youwillhave food
given youforyourselves andaportion forme. Bring itallhome with

"What, notyetonyourway,mysons 1"said he. "No, sir;wehave
not started." "Why, pray?""Because that lazy so-and-so, when he
went wood-gathering with us,laydown tosleep under aforest-tree;and,
tomake upforlosttime, heclimbed uj)thetree insuch ahurry thathe
hurt hiseyeandbrought home alotofgreen wood, which hethrew onthe

went tothestack, shetook hiswood, thinking itwould ofcourse bedry;
andnofirecould shelight before thesunwas up.And this iswhat

Heai-ing what theyoung brahmin haddone, themaster exclaimed that
afool's doings hadcaused allthemischief, andrepeated thisstanza:

SuchwastheBodhisatta's comment onthematter tohis[)upils ;andat
theclose ofalifeofcharity andother goodworks hepassed away tofare
accoi'dinsf tohisdeserts.
Said theMaster, "This isnotthe first time. Brethren, that thisman has
thwarted you ;hedidthelike inthepast also." Hislesson ended, heshewed
theconnexion andidentified theBirth bysaying, "The Brother whohasbroken

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasconceived byanelephant intheHimalayas. When born,
hewaswhite allover, likeamighty mass ofsilver. Likediamond balls
were hiseyes, likeamanifestation ofthefivebrightnesses'; redwas his
mouth, likescarlet cloth;like silver flecked with redgoldwas histrunk
;
andhisfour feetwere asifpolished with lac. Tluis hisperson, adorned
with thetenperfections, wasofconsumrnate beauty. When hegrew up,all
theelephants oftheHimalayas inabody [320] followed him astlieir
leader. Whilst hewasdwelling intheHimalayas with afollowing of
80,000 elephants, hebecame aware that there was sinintheherd. So,
detaching himself from therest,hedwelt insolitude intheforest, andthe
goodness ofhislifewonhimthename ofGoodKing Elephant.
Now aforester ofBenares came totheHimalayas, aiulmade hisway
into that forest inquest oftheimplements ofhis craft. Losing his
bearings and hisway,heroamed toand fro,stretching outhisarms in
despair andweeping, with thefear ofdeatli before hiseyes. Hearing the
man's cries, theBodhisatta wasmoved with compassion and resolved to
helphiminhisneed. Soheapproached theman. But atsight ofthe
elephant, offrantheforester ingreat terror^. Seeing himlunaway, the
Bodhisatta stood still,andthisbrought theman toastandstill too.Then
theBodhisatta again advanced, andagain theforester ranaway, halting
oncemorewhen theBodhisatta halted. Hereupon thetruth dawned on
theman that theelephant stood stillwhen hehimself ran,andonly
advanced when hehimself wasstanding still. Consequently heconcluded
that thecreatui'e could notmean tohurt, buttohelphim. Sohevaliantly
stood hisground this time. And theBodhisatta drew near and said,
"Why, friend man, areyouwandering about herelamenting?"
"My lord," replied theforester, "Ihave lostmybearings andmyway,
and fear toperish."
Then theelephant brought theman tohisown dwelling, andthere
entertained him forsome days, regaling himwith fruits ofevery kind.
Then, saying, "Fear not,friend man, Twillbring youback tothehaunts
ofmen," theelephant seated theforester onhisbackandbrought him to
where mendwelt. Buttheingrate thought tohimself, that, ifquestioned,
heought tobeable toreveal everything. So,ashetravelled along onthe
elephant's back, henoted thelandmarks oftreeand hill.Atlastthe
elephant brought himoutoftheforest andsethimdown onthehighroad
toBenares, saying, "There liesyoiir road, friend man :Tellnoman,
whether youarequestioned ornot, oftheplace ofmyabode." Andwith
thisleave-taking, theBodhisatta made hiswayback tohisownabode.
Arrived atBenares, themancame, inthecourse ofhiswalks through

theywould giveanything forthetusk ofaliving elephant.
"What makes youasksuch aquestion ?"wasthereply."Aliving
elephant's tusk isworth agreat dealmore than adead one's."
"Oh,then, I'llbring yousome ivoi'y," said he,and offhesetfor
theBodhisatta's dwelling, with provisions forthejoui-ney, andwith a
sharp saw. Being asked whathadbrought himback, hewhined outthat
hewasinsosorry andwretched aplight thathecould notmake aliving
anyhow. Wherefore, hehadcome toask forabitofthekind elephant's
tusk tosellforaliving !"Certainly ;Iwillgiveyouawhole tusk,"
said theBodhisatta, "ifyouhave abitofasaw tocut itoffwith."
"Oh, Ibrought asawwith me, sir.""Then sawmytusks off,andtake
themaway with you," saidtheBodhisatta. And hebowed hisknees till
hewascouched upon theearth likeanox.Then theforester sawed off
both oftheBodhisatta's chief tusks !When theywere off,theBodhisatta
tookthem inhistrunk andthus addressed theman, "Think not, friend
man, that itisbecause Ivalue notnorprize these tusks that 1givethem
toyou. Butathousand times, ahundred-thousand times, dearer tome
arethetusks ofomniscience which cancomprehend allthings. And
therefore maymygiftofthese toyoubringmeomniscience." With these
words, hegave thepair oftusks totheforester astheprice ofomniscience.
And theman tookthem off,andsoldthem. Andwhen hehadspent
themoney, back hecame totheBodhisatta, saying thatthetwotusks had
onlybrought himenough topayhisolddebts, andbegging fortherest of
theBodhisatta's ivory. TheBodhisatta consented, andgaveuptherest
ofhisivory after having itcutasbefore. And theforester wentaway
andsold this also. Returning again, hesaid, "It'snouse,mylord;1
can'tmake aliving anvhow. Sogivemethestumps ofyour tusks."
"Sobeit,"answei'ed theBodhisatta ;andhelaydown asbefore.
Then that vilewretch, trampling upon thetrunk oftheBodhisatta, that
sacred trunk which waslikecorded silver, andclambering upon thefuture
Buddha's temples, which were asthesnowy eldest ofMount Kelasa,—kicked
attheroots ofthetusks tillhehadcleared thefleshaway. Then hesawed

hasnoknowledge oftheMaster's excellence; heactually goesabout tokill
him !"Here theMaster entered theHallandasked what theywere discussing.
[323] Being told, hesaid,"This isnotthe finst time, Brethren, thatDevadatta
hasgoneabout tokillme;hedidjustthesame inbygone days also." And so
saying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta wasreigning inBenares. Hehadason
named Prince Wicked. Fierce andcruel was he,likeascotched snake;
hespoke tonobody without abuse orblows. Like gritintheeyewasthis
prince toallfolkboth within andwithout thepalace, orlikearavening
ogre,—sodreaded and fellwashe.
Oneday,wishing todisport himself intheriver, hewent with alarge
retinue tothewater side.And agreat storm came on,andutter darkness
setin. "Hithere !"cried hetohisservants;"takemeintomid-stream,

bathemethere, andthen bringmeback again." Sotheytookhiminto
mid-stream andthere took counsel together, saying, "What willtheking
dotolis1Letuskill thiswicked wretch hereandnow !Soinyou go,
youpest!"they cried, asthey flung him into thewater. When they
made theirwayashore, theywere asked where theprince was,andreplied,
"Wedon't seehim ;finding thestorm come on,hemusthavecome outof
theriverandgonehome ahead ofus,"
Thecourtiers went intotheking's presence, andtheking asked where
hissonwas. "Wedonotknow, sire," saidthey;"astorm came on,and
wecameaway inthebelief thathemust have goneonahead." Atonce
thekinghadthegates thrown open ;down totheriverside hewentand
bade diligent search bemade upanddown forthemissing prince. But
notrace ofhimcould befound. For, inthedarkness ofthestorm, hehad
been swept away bythecurrent, and,coming across atree-trunk, had
climbed ontoit,and sofloated down stream, crying lustily intheagony
ofhisfearofdrowning.
Now therehadbeen arichmerchant living inthose days atBenares,
whohaddied, leaving forty crores buried inthebanks ofthatsame river.
And because ofhiscraving forriches, hewasreborn asasnake atthe
spotunder which layhisdear treasui'e. And also inthese'lfsame spot
another manhadhidden thirty crores, andbecause ofhiscraving for
riches wasre-born asaratatthesame spot. Inrushed thewater into
their dwelling-place;andthetwocreatures, escaping bythewaybywhich
thewater rushed in,weremaking theirwayathwart thestream, when
theychanced upon thetree-trunk towhich theprince was clinging. [324]
Thesnake climbed upatoneend,andtheratattheother ;andsoboth
gotafooting with theprince onthetrunk.
Also there grew ontheriver's bank aSilk-cotton tree, inwhich lived
ayoung parrot; and this tree,being uprooted bytheswollen waters, fell
intotheriver. Theheavy rain beatdown theparrot when ittried tofly,
and italighted initsfallupon thissame tree-trunk. And sothere were
nowthese four floating down stream together upon thetree.
Now theBodhisatta hadbeen re-born inthose days asabrahmin in
theNorth-West country. Renouncing theworld forthehermit's lifeon
reaching manhood, hehad built himself ahermitage byabend ofthe
river ;andthere hewasnow living. Ashewaspacing toand fro,at
midnight, heheard theloud cries oftheprince, andthought thuswithin
himself:—"This fellow-creature must notperish thus before theeyes of
somerciful andcompassionate ahermit asIam. Iwillrescue himfrom
thewater, andsave hislife." Soheshouted cheerily, "Benotafraid! Be
notafraid !"andplunging across stream, seized hold ofthetreebyoneend,
and,being asstrong asanelephant, drew itintotliebank withonelong
pull,and settheprince safeandsound upon theshore. Then becoming


No. 73. 179
aware ofthesnake andtheratandtheparrot, hecarried them tohis
hermitage, andthere lighting afire,warmed theanimals first, asbeing
theweaker, andafterwards theprince. This done, hebrought fruits of
various kinds and setthem before hisguests, looking after theanimals
firstandtheprince afterwards. This enraged theyoung prince, who said
within himself, "This rascally hermit paysnorespect tomyroyal birth,
butactually gives brute beasts precedence overme."And heconceived
hatred against theBodhisatta !
Afewdays later,when allfourhadrecovered their strength andthe
waters hadsubsided, thesnake bade farewell tothehermit with these
words, "Father, youhavedonemeagreat service. Iamnotpoor, forI
have forty crores ofgold hidden atacertain spot. Should youever
want money, allmyhoard shall beyours. Youhave only tocome tothe
spotand call'Snake.'" Next therattook hisleave with alikepromise
tothehermit astohistreasure, bidding thehermit come and callout
'Rat.' [325]Then theparrot bade farewell, saying, "Father, silver andgold
have Inone ;butshould youeverwant forchoice rice,come towhere
Idwell and callout'Parrot;' andIwith theaidofmykinsfolk willgive
youmany waggon-loads ofrice." Lastcame theprince. Hisheart was
filled with base ingratitude andwith adetermination toputhisbenefactor
todeath, iftheBodhisatta should come tovisit him. But, concealing his
intent, hesaid,"Come, father, tomewhen Iamking, andIwillbestow
onyoutheFour Requisites." Sosaying, hetook hisdeparture, andnot
long after succeeded tothethrone.
Thedesire came ontheBodhisatta toputtheir professions tothetest;
and firstofallhewent tothesnake andstanding hardbyitsabode, called
out'Snake.' Attheword thesnake darted forth andwith every mark
ofrespect said, "Father, inthisplace there areforty crores ingold. Dig
themupandtakethem all." "It iswell," saidtheBodhisatta; "when I
need thejn, Iwillnotforget." Then bidding adieu tothesnake, hewent
ontowhere theratlived, and called out'Rat.' And theratdidasthe
snake haddone. Going next totheparrot, and calling out'Parrot,' the
birdatonce flewdown athiscallfrom thetree-top, andrespectfully asked
whether itwastheBodhisatta's wish thathewith theaidofhiskinsfolk
should gather paddy fortheBodhisatta from theregion round theHima-
layas. TheBodhisatta dismissed theparrot alsowithapromise that, ifneed
arose, hewould notforget thebird's offer. Last ofall,being minded to
testtheking inhisturn, theBodhisatta came totheroyal pleasaunce, and
onthedayafter hisarrival made hisway, carefully dressed, intothecity
onhisround foralms. Just atthatmoment, theungrateful king, seated
inallhisroyal splendour onhiselephant ofstate, waspassing insolemn
procession round thecityfollowed byavast retinue. Seeing theBodhi-
satta from afar,hethought tohimself, "Here's that rascally hermit come

toquarter himself and hisappetite onme. Imust have hishead off
before hecanpublish totheworld theservice herendered me." With
this intent, hesigned tohisattendants, and,ontheir asking what was
hispleasure, said,"Methinks yonder rascally hermit ishere toimportune
me. Seethat thepestdoesnotcome nearmyperson, butseizeandbind
him; [326] floghim atevery street-corner; andthenmarch himoutof
the city,chop offhishead attheplace ofexecution, andimpale his
body onastake."
Obedient totheir king's command, theattendants laidtheinnocent
Great Being inbonds andflogged him atevery street-corner ontheway
totheplace ofexecution. But alltheir floggings failed tomove the
Bodhisatta ortowring fromhimanycryof"Oh,mymother andfather!"
Allhedidwas torepeat thisStanza:—
Theyknew theworld, whoframed thisproverb true—
'Alogpays better salvage thansome men.'
These lines herepeated wherever hewas flogged, tillatlastthewise
among thebystanders asked thehermit what service hehad rendei'ed
totheir king. Then theBodhisatta toldthewhole story, ending with
thewords,—"So itcomes topassthatbyrescuing himfrom thetorrent I
brought allthiswoeupon myself. Andwhen Ibethink mehow Ihave
leftunheeded thewords ofthewise ofold,Iexclaim asyouhave heard."
Filled with indignation atthe recital, thenobles andbrahmins and all
classes withoneaccord cried out,"This ungrateful king doesnotrecognise
even thegoodness ofthisgoodmanwhosaved hismajesty's life.How
canwehave any profit from thisking 1Seize thetyrant!"And in
their anger they rushed upon theking from every side,andslewhim
there andthen, asherodeonhiselephant, with arrows andjavelins and
.stones andclubs andanyweapons thatcame tohand. Thecorpse they
dragged bytheheels toaditch andflung itin.Then theyanointed the
Bodhisatta kingandsethimtoruleoverthem.
Ashewasruling inrighteousness, oneday[327] thedesire came onhim
again totrythesnake andtheratandthepaiTot ;andfollowed bya
large retinue, hecame towhere thesnake dwelt. Atthe callof'Snake,'
outcame thesnake from hisholeandwith every mark ofrespect said,
"Here, mylord, isyour treasure ;take it."Then theking delivered the
forty crores ofgold tohisattendants, andproceeding towhere therat
dwelt, called, 'Rat.' Outcame the rat,andsaluted theking, andgaveup
itsthirty crores. Placing thistreasure toointhehands ofhisattendants,
thekingwentontowhere theparrot dwelt, and called 'Parrot.' And in
likemanner thebirdcame, andbowing down attheking's feetasked
whether itshould collect riceforhismajesty. "We willnottrouble you,"
saidtheking, "till rice isneeded. Now letusbegoing." Sowith the

thekingjourneyed back tothecity. Here, inanoble palace, tothestate-
