totheMaster, bowed down before him,andseating himself onone side,spoke as

"As theywho ate."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aconcupiscent Brother. Tradition saystherewasascion ofagood family
whogave hisheart totheBuddha's doctrine andjoined theBrotherhood. Butone
day ashewasgoing hisround foralms inSavatthi, hewasthere stirred to
concupiscence bythesight ofabeautifully dressed woman. Being brought by
histeachers anddirectors before theMaster, headmitted inanswer totheen-
quiries oftheBlessed Onethatthespirit ofconcupiscence hadentered intohim.
Then saidtheMaster, "Verily thefivelusts ofthesenses aresweet inthehour
ofactual enjoyment, Brother; butthisenjoyment ofthem (inthat itentails
themiseries ofre-birth inhellandtheother evil states) isliketheeating
ofthefruit oftheWhat-fruit tree. Very fairtoview isthe"What-fruit, very
fragrant andsweet ;butwhen eaten, itracks theinwards andbrings death. In
other da^'s, through ignorance [368] ofitsevilnature, amultitude ofmen, seduced
bythebeauty, fragrance andsweetness ofthefruit, atethereof sothatthey died."
Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once upon atimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeastheleader ofacaravan. Oncewhen journeying
with fivehundred cartsfrom East toWest, hecame totheoutskirts ofa
forest. Assembling hismen, hesaid tothem:—"Inthis forest grow
trees that bear poisonous fruit. Letnoman eatanyunfamiliar fruit
without firstasking me."When theyhadtraversed theforest, theycame
attheother border onaWhat-fruit treewith itsboughs bending lowwith
their burthen offruit. Inform, smell and taste, itstrunk, boughs, leaves
and fruit resembled amango. Taking the tree, from itsmisleading
appearance andsoforth, tobeamango, some plucked thefruitandate;
butothers said, "Letusspeak toourleader before weeat."And these
latter, plucking thefruit, waited forhim tocome up.When hecame, he
ordered them toflingaway thefruit theyhadpkicked, andhadanemetic
administered tothose whohad already eaten. Ofthese latter, some
recovered;butsuch ashadbeen the first toeat, died. TheBodhisatta
reached hisdestination insafety, and sold hiswares ataprofit, after
which hetravelled home again. After alifespent incharity andother
good works, hepassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

Itwaswhen hehadtoldthis story, thattheMaster, asBuddha, uttered this
stanza:—
Astheywho atetheWhat-fruit died, soLusts,
Wlien ripe, slayhimwhoknowing notthewoe
They breed hereafter, stoops tolustful deeds.
Having thusshewn thattheLusts, which aresosweet inthehour offruition,
end l:>yslaying their votaries, the^Master preached theFour Truths, attheclose
[369] whereof theconcupiscent Brother wasconverted andwontheFruit ofthe
First Path. OftherestoftheBuddha's following somewon theFirst, some
theSecond, andsome theThird Path, whilst others again became Arahats.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identitied theBirth bysaying, "My disciples
were thepeople ofthecaravan inthose days,and Itheir leader."

"yaught can co7)ijx(re."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about abrahmin whoputtothetesthisreputation forgoodness. This Brother,
whowasmaintained bytheKing ofKosala, hadsought theThree Refuges ;he
kept theFiveCommandments, andwasversed intheThree Vedas. "This is
agood man," thought theKing, andshewed him great honour. But that
Brother thought tohimself, "The King shews honoiu* tomebeyond other
brahmins, andhasmanifested hisgreat regard bymaking mehisspiritual
director. But ishisfevour due tomygoodness oronly tomy l)irth, lineage,
family, country andaccomplishments? Imust clear thisupwithout delay."
Accordingly, onedaywhen hewasleaving thepalace, hetookunbidden acoin
from atreasurer's counter, andwent hisway. Suchwasthetreasurer's venera-
tion forthebrahmin thathesatperfectly stillandsaidnotaword. Nextday
thebrahmin tooktwocoins ;but stillthe official made noremonstrance. The
third daythebrahmin tookawhole handful ofcoins. "This isthethird day,"
cried thetreasurer, "that youhave robbed hisMajesty;" andheshouted out
three times,—"Ihave caught thethiefwhorobs thetreasury." Inrushed a
crowd ofpeople from every side, crying, "Ah, you've longbeen posing asamodel
ofgoodness." And dealing himtwoorthree blows, they ledhim before the
King. Ingreat sorrow theKing said tohim,"What ledyou,brahmin, todoso
wicked athing?" Andhegave orders, saying, "Off withhim topunishment."
"Iamnothief, sire," saidthebrahmin. "Then whydidyoutakemoney from
thetreasury?""Because youshewed mesuch great honour, sire,andbecause I
madeupmymind tofindoutwhether thathonour waspaid tomybirthandthe

never attain inthis life,whilst Iremain alayman, living inthemidst ofsinful
pleasures. Wherefore, thisveryday Iwould faingototheMaster atJetavana
andrenounce theworld fortheBrotherhood. Grant lueyour leave, sire." The
King consenting, thebrahmin setoutforJetavana. Hisfriends andrelations in
abody tried toturnhimfrom hispurpose, but,finding their efi'orts ofnoavail,
lefthim alone. Hecame totheIMaster andasked tobeadmitted totheBrother-
hood. After admission tothelower andhigher orders, hewonbyapplication
si)iritual insight andbecame anArahat, whereon hedrew near totheMaster,
saying, "Sir,myjoining theOrder hasborne theSupreme Fruit,"—thereby
signifying thathehadwonArahatship. Hearing ofthis,theBrethren, assembling
intheHall ofTruth, spoke withoneanother ofthevirtues oftheKing's chaplain
who tested hisownreputation forgoodness andwho, leaving theKing, hadnow
risen tobeanArahat. Entering theHall, theMaster asked what theBrethren
were discussing, andthey toldhim. "Not without aprecedent. Brethren," said
he,"istheaction ofthisbrahmin inputting tothetest hisreputation for
goodness andinworking outhissalvation after renouncing theworld. The like
wasdonebythewiseandgood ofbygone days aswell." And sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta was hischaplain,—aman given tocharity andother good
works, whose mind was setonrighteousness, always keeping unbroken
theFiveCommandments. And theKing honoured himbeyond theother
brahmins ;andeverything came topass asabove.
But, astheBodhisatta wasbeing bi'ought inbonds before theKing,
hecame where some snake-charmers were exhibiting asnake, which they
laid hold ofbythe tailand the throat, and tiedround their necks.
Seeing this, theBodhisatta begged themen todesist, forthesnake might
bitethem and cut their lives short. "Brahmin," replied thesnake-
charmers, "this isagoodandwell-behaved cobra ;he'snotwicked like
you,who foryour wickedness andmisconduct arebeing hauled offin
custody."
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "Even cobras, ifthey donotbite
orwound, arecalled 'good.' Howmuch moremust thisbethecasewith
thosewhohavecome tobehuman beings !Verily itisjust thisgoodness
which isthemost excellent thing inalltheworld, nor[371] doesaught
surpass it."Then hewasbrought before theKing. "What isthis,my
friends'?" said theKing. "Here's athiefwhohasbeen robbing your
majesty's treasury." "Away withhim toexecution." "Sire," saidthe
brahmin, "Iamnothief." "Then howcame you totake themoney?"
Hereon theBodhisatta made answer precisely asabove, ending asfollows:—
"This then iswhy Ihavecome totheconclusion that itisgoodness which
isthehighest andmost excellent thing inalltheworld. Butbethat as
itmay, yet,seeing that thecobra, when itdoesnotbiteorwound, must
simply becalled 'good' andnothing more, forthis reason too itis

goodness alone which isthehighest andmost excellent ofallthings,"
Then inpraise ofgoodness heuttered thisstanza :—
Naught cancompare withGoodness; alltheworld
Cannot itsequal show. Thecobra fell,
Ifmenaccount it'good,' issaved from death.
After preaching thetruth totheKing inthis stanza, theBodhisatta,
abjuring allLusts, andrenouncing theworld forthehermit's life,repaired
totheHimalayas, where heattained tothefiveKnowledges andthe
eight Attainments, earning forhimself thesurehope ofi-e-birth thereafter
intheBrahma Kealm.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "My disciples
were theKing's following inthose days,and Imyself theKing's chaplain."

"What areyoudoing, young brahmin?" asked theMaster.
"MygoodGotama\" wasthereply, "this suitofclothes, having beengnawed

wherefore myfather, fearing thataservant might covet andretain theclothes,

young man's very eyes, regardless ofthelatter's earnest warnings and re[)eated
entreaties tohim not totakethem; andhedeparted inthedirection of
theBamboo-grove.
Home inallhaste rantheyoung brahmin, totellhisfather howtheSage
Gotama haddeclared that theclothes would just suit him,'andhad persisted,
inspite ofallwarnings tothecontrary, intaking tliesuitaway withhimtothe

abundance ofother garments andgethim tothrow that suitaway." Sowith a

When hecameupon tlieMaster hestood respectfully ononesideandspoke thus,—"Is itindeed true, asIhear, thatyou,mygoodGotama, [373] picked upasuit
ofclothes inthecharnel-ground?" "Quite true,brahmin." "MygoodGotama,
that suit isaccursed ;ifyoumake useofthem, they willdestroy you. Ifyou
stand inneed ofclothes, take these andthrow away that suit." "Brahmin,"
replied theMaster, "byopen profession Ihaverenounced theworld, andam
content withtheragsthat liebytheroadside orbathing-places, orarethrown
away ondustheaps orincharnel-grounds. Whereas youhave heldyour super-
stitions inbygone days, aswell asatthepresent time." Sosaying, atthe
brahmin's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime there reigned inthecityofRajagaha, inthekingdom
ofMagadha, arighteous King ofMagadha. Inthose days theBodhisatta
came tolifeagain asabiahmin oftheNorth-west. Growing up,he
renounced theworld forthehermit's life,won theKnowledges andthe
Attainments, andwent todwell intheHimalayas. Onone occasion,
returning from theHimalayas, andtaking uphisabode intheKing's
pleasaunce, hewent onthesecond day into thecity tocollect alms.
Seeing hira, theKing hadhimsummoned into thepalace and there
provided with aseatandwith food,—exacting apromise fromhimthat
hewould takeuphisabode inthepleasaunce. SotheBodhisatta used to

Now inthose days there dwelt inthat city abrahmin known as
Cloth-omens. Andhehadinachest asuitofclothes which weregnawed
bymice, andeverything came topass just asintheforegoing story. But
when thesonwasonhiswaytothecharnel-ground theBodhisatta gotthere
firstandtook hisseat atthegate; and, picking upthesuitwhich the
young brahmin threw away, hereturned tothepleasannce. When the
sontold this totheoldbrahmin, thelatter exclaimed, "It willbethe
deatli oftheKing's ascetic"
:andentreated theBodhisatta tothrow that
suitaway, lestheshould perish. Buttheascetic replied, "Good enough
forusaretherags that areflung away incharnel-grounds. Wehave
nobelief insuperstitions about luck,which arenotapproved byBuddhas,
Pacceka Buddhas, orBodhisattas ;andtherefore nowisemanought to

forsook hiserrors andtook refuge intheBodhisatta. And theBodhisatta,
preserving hisInsight uul)roken, earned re-birth thereafter intheBrahma
Realm. [374.]
Having told this story, theMaster, asBuddha, taught theTruth to
thebrahmin inthisstanza:—•
Whoso renounces omens, dreams and signs.
That man, from sui)erstition's errors freed,
Shall trium})li o'erthepaired Depravities
And o'erAttachments totheend uftime.

"Hoiv plausible." This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about aknave. Thedetails ofhisknavery willberelated intheUddrda-jataka^.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, there
lived hardbyacertain little village ashifty rascal ofanascetic, ofthe
class which wears long, matted hair. The squire oftheplace hada
hermitage built intheforest forhim todwell in,andused toprovide
excellent fareforhiminhisown house. Taking thematted-haired rascal
tobeamodel ofgoodness, andliving ashedidinfearofrobbers, thesquire
brought ahundred pieces ofgold tothehermitage andthere buried them,
bidding theascetic keepwatch over them. "Noneed tosaythat, sir,to
amanwhohasrenounced theworld ;wehermits never covet other folks'
goods." "It iswell, sir," saidthesquire, whowent offwith fullconfidence
intheother's protestations. Then therascally ascetic thought tohimself,
"there's enough here [376] tokeep aman allhis lifelong." Allowing a
fewdays toelapse first,heremoved thegoldandburied itbythewayside,
returning todwell asbefore inhishermitage. Next day, after ameal of
rice atthesquire's house, theascetic said, "It isnowalong time, sir,
since Ibegan tobesupported byyou ;and tolivelong inoneplace
islike living intheworld,—which isforbidden to})rofe8sed ascetics.
Wherefore Imust needs depart." Andthough thesquire pi-essed him to
stay, nothing could overcome thisdetermination.

"Well, then, ifitmust beso,goyour way, sir," said thesquire ;and
heescorted theascetic totheoutskirts before helefthim. After going a
littlewaytheascetic thought that itwould beagood thing tocajole the
squire ;so,putting astraw inhismatted hair, back heturned again.
"What brings youback?" asked thesquire. "Astraw fromyour roof,
sir,hadstuck inmyhair ;and, aswehermits may nottakeanything
which isnotbestowed upon us,Ihavebrought itback toyou." "Throw it
down, sir,andgoyour way," said the squire, whothought tohimself,
"Wliy, hewon't take somuch asastraw which doesnotbelong tohim !
What asensitive nature!" Highly delighted with theascetic, thesquire
badehim farewell.
Now atthattime itchanced that theBodhisatta, whowasonhisway
totheborder-district fortrading purposes, hadhalted forthenight at
that village. Hearing what theascetic said, thesuspicion wasaroused in
hismind that therascally ascetic must have robbed thesquire ofsome-
thing;andheasked thelatter whether hehaddeposited anything inthe
ascetic's care.
"Yes,—ahundred pieces ofgold."
"Well, justgoandseeifit'sallsafe."
Away went thesquire tothehermitage, andlooked, andfound his
money gone. Running back totheBodhisatta, hecried, "It'snotthere."
"The thief isnone other than that long-haired rascal ofanascetic," said
theBodhisatta; "letuspursue andcatch him." Soaway they hastened
inhotpursuit. When theycaught therascal theykicked andcuffed him,
tillhediscovered tothem where hehadhidden themoney. When he
procured thegold, theBodhisatta, looking at it,scornfully remarked
totheascetic, "Soahundred pieces ofgold didn't trouble your conscience
somuch asthatstraw!" Andherebuked him inthisstanza :—
How plausible thestory that therascal told !
How heedful ofthestraw !How heedless ofthegold !
[377]When theBodhisatta hadrebuked thefellow inthis wise, he
added,—"Andnowtake care,you hypocrite, thatyoudon't playsuch a
trick again." When his lifeended, theBodhisatta passed away tofare
thereafter according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said,"Thus you .see,Brethren, that thisBi'other
wasasknavish inthepast asheisto-day." And heidentified theBirth by
saying, "This knavish Brother wastheknavish ascetic ofthose days, and Ithe
