cryofbird orbea.st would inspire himwith such abject terror thathewould
shriek anddash away. Henever reflected thatdeath wassure toconie upon
him;though, hadhepractised meditation onthecertainty ofdeath, hewould
nothave feared it.[415] Foronly they thatdonotsomeditate fear death.
Now hisconstant fear ofdying became known totheBrethren, andoneday
theymet intheHall ofTruth and felltodiscussing hisfearfulness andthe
propriety ofevery Brother's taking death asatheme formeditation. Entering
theHall, theMaster asked, andwas told,what theywere discussing. Sohesent
forthatBrother andasked himwhether itwastruehelived infearofdeath.
TheBrother confessed thathedid."Benotangry. Brethren," saidtheMaster,
"with thisBrother. The fear ofdeath that tills hisbreast nowwasnoless
strong inbygone times." Sosaying hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatiuiewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodlii-

put hisstate elephant intheelepliant-trainers' hands tobebroken into

intheir hands setal)Out training theanimal. Unable tobear thepain
whilst hewasbeing made todotheir bidding, tlieelephant broke thepost
down, putthetrainers toflight, andmade offtotheHimalayas. And
themen, being unable tocatch it,had tocome back empty-handed. The
elephant lived intheHimalayas inconstant fear ofdeath.Abreath of
wind sufficed to fillhimwith fearand tostarthim offatfull speed,
shaking histrunk toand fro.And itwaswithhim asthough hewas
stilltiedtothepost tobetrained. Allhappiness ofmind andbody gone,
hewandered upanddown inconstant dread. Seeing this,theTi-ee-Sprite
stood inthefork ofhisti'eeanduttered thisstanza:—
Fear'st thou thewind that ceaselessly
The i-otteu boughs doth rend alway I
Such fear willwaste thee quite away!
[416] Such were theTree-Sprite's cheering words. And theelephant
thenceforth feared nomore.
Hislesson ended, theMaster taught theFour Trutlis (attheclose whereof
tlieBrother entered the Paths), and identified theBirth bysaying, "This

stones;andthathearing tlieTruth preached onedayhegave hisheart toitand,
giving uptheworld, wasadmitted tofullBrotherhood. Butneither instudy nor
practice didheexcel asaBrother. Oneday,with ayouthful Brother, hewent
totheriver Aciravatii, andwasstanding onthebank after bathing, when hesaw
twowhite swans flying by. Saidhetotheyounger Brother, "I'll hitthehinder
swan intheeyeandbring itdown." "Bring itdown indeed!" saidtheother;
"you can't hitit.""Just youwait amoment. I'llhit itontheeyethis side

thechaplain short, andlooked highandlowforsuchanone.Now at
thattime there wasacripple inBenares whowasawonderful marksman
with stones, andtheboys used toputhimonalittle cartand[419]
draw him tothegates ofBenares, where there isalarge branching
banyan-tree covered with leaves. There theywould gather round and
givehim half-pence, saying'Make anelephant,' or'Make ahorse.'
And the ci'ipple would throw stone after stone tillhehad cutthe
foliage into theshapes asked for.And thegi-ound wascovered with
fallen leaves.
Onhisway tohispleasaunce theKing came tothespot, and allthe
boysscampered offinfearoftheKing, leaving thecripple there helpless.
Atthesight ofthe litter ofleaves theKing asked, asherodebyinhis

haddone it.Thinking that heremight beaway tostop thechaplain's
mouth, theKing asked where thecripple was,andwasshewn himsitting
atthefoot ofthe tree. Then theKing hadhimbrought tohimand,
motioning hisretinue tostand apart, said tothecripple, "Ihave avery
talkative chaplain. Doyouthink youcould stop histalking?"
"Yes, sire,—ifIhadapeashooter fullofdrygoat's dung," saidthe
cripple. Then theKing hadhimtaken tothepalace and setwith apea-
shooter fullofdrygoat's dung behind acurtain with aslitinit,facing the
chaplain's seat.When thebrahmin came towaitupon theKing andwas
seated ontheseatprepared forhim, hismajesty started aconversation.
And thechaplain forthwith monopolized theconversation, andnooneelse

onebyone, like flies,through the slitinthecurtain right intothechap-
lain's gullet. And thebrahmin swallowed thepellets down astheycame,
likesomuch oil, tillallhaddisappeared. When thewhole peashooter-full
ofpellets waslodged inthechaplain's stomach, they swelled tothesize

brahmin inthese words: "Reverend sir,sotalkative areyou, thatyou

From thatday[420] thechaplain kept hismouth shutand satas

''•Learn thou betimes."—This story was toldbytheMaster, while hewas
dwelling intheGabled Chamber attheGreat Grove near Vesali, about aLicchavi,
ai)ious })riuce whohadembraced theTruth. Hehadinvited theBrotherhood
with theBuddha attheir head tohishouse, andthere hadshewn great bounty
towards them. Now hiswifewasavery fatwoman, almost bloated inap-
pearance, andshewasbadly dressed.
Thanking theKing forhishospitality, theMaster returned tothemonastery
and, after adiscourse totheBrethren, retired tohisperfumed chamber.
Assembled intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren expressed their surprise thata
man like tliisLicchavi prince should have such afatl)adly-dressed woman for
hiswife,and l;)esofond ofher. Entering theHallandhearing what theywere
discussing, theMaster said, "Brethren, asnow, soinformer times hewasfond
ofafatwoman." Then, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
[421] Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares

country woman, whoworked forhire,waspassing near thecourtyard of
thepalace, when pressing need foranoccasion came upon hei\ Bendino-
down with herraiment decently gathered round her,sheaccomplished
herpurpose, andwaserect again inatrice.
TheKing chanced tobelooking outontothecourtyard through a
window atthetimeandsaw this. Thought he,"Awoman whocould
manage thiswith somuch decency must enjoy good health. Shewould
besure tobecleanly inherhouse ;andasonborn into acleanly house
would besure togrow upcleanly and virtuous. Iwillmake hermy
queen-consort." And accordingly theKing, firstassuring himself thatshe

wasnotanother's, sent forherandmade herhisqueen. And shebecame
verynearanddear tohim. Notlongafterwards asonwasborn, andthis
sonbecame anUniversal Monarch.
Observing herfortunes, theBodhisatta took occasion tosaytothe
King, "Sire, why should not care betaken duly tofulfil allproper
observances, when this excellent woman byhermodesty anddecency in
relieving nature wonyour majesty's favour and rose tosuch fortune?"
Andhewentontoutter thisstanza:—
Learn thou betimes, though headstrong folkthere be;The rustic pleased theKing bymodesty.
Thus didtheGreat Being commend thevirtues ofthosewhodevoted
themselves tothestudy ofproper observances.

NowatSavatthi theIjrotherhood with theBuddha attheirheadused tobe

Orabody ofpeople orawhole street would club together, orsometimes the
whole cityentertained them. Butontheoccasion now inquestion itwasa

provide rice-gruel followed bycakes.
Now inthat sti'eet there lived averypoorman, ahired labourer, whocould
notseehowhecould give thegruel, butresolved togive cakes. And he
scraped outtheredpowder fromempty husks andkneaded itwithwater intoa
round cake. This cake hewrapped inaleafofswallow-wort, andbaked itin

should have it,andaccordingly took hisstand immediately bytheMaster. No
sooner hadtheword beengiven tooffer cakes, than hestepped forward quicker
tliananyone elseandputhiscake intheMaster's alms-bowl. And theMaster
declined allotlier cakes offered himandatethepoorman's cake. Forthwith the
whole citytalked ofnothing buthowtheAll-Enlightened Onehadnotdisdained

Thinking heliadbetter asktheMaster first,hewent tohimandstated his
case. "Take what they offer," saidtheMaster, "andimpute your righteousness
toallliving creatures." Sotheman settowork tocollect theofferings. Some
gave twice asmuch asothers, some fourtimes asmuch, others eight times as
much, andsoon, tillnine crores ofgoldwere contributed.
Returning thanks forthehospitality, theMaster went back tothemonastery
andafter instructing theBrethren andim[)arting hisblessed teaching tothem,
retired tohis[)erfumed chamber.
Intheevening theKing sent fen-thepoorman, and created himLord

ofthose dayswere superstitious about gods. A.festival came round and
thevillagers ofiered sacrifices totheir respective Tree-sprites. Seeing
this,apoormanshewed worship tothecastor-oil tree. Alltheothers had
come with garlands, odours, perfumes, andcakes ;butthepoormanhad
only acake ofhusk-powder andwater inacocoanut shell forhistree.
Standing before it,hethought within himself, "Tree-sprites areused to

dawned. Waking upandseeing itwasbroad daylight, heknew thathe
could notmake hiswayback atthathour with safety. Sohelaydown
quietly near theroadside where hecould notbeseen, tillatlasthesawa

jackal thought tohimself, "Brahmins areagreedy lot. Imust soplayon

"Who callsme?" said thebrahmin, turning round. "I,brahmin."
"What for*?" "Ihavetwohundred gold j)ieces, brahmin; and ifyou
will liidemeinyour waist-cloth under your outer robeandsogetmeout

Closing with the offer, thegreedy bi-ahmin hidthejackal andcarried
thebeast alittlewayoutofthe city."What place isthis,brahmin?"
said thejackal. "Oh, it'ssuch andsuch aplace," said thebrahmin.
"Goonabitfurther," said thejackal andkept urging thebrahmin on

Assembling intheHall ofTruth theBrethren talked together ofthis thing.
And theMaster entered andwas toldwhat theywere discussing. Being asked
whether they were really soindolent, those Brethren admitted their short-
coming. "Brethren," said he,"informer times, nolessthan now, they were
indolent andloth toleave their abode." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.

gerous andperilous neighbourhood, where fishermen catch fishwith nets,
basket-traps, andsuch like tackle. Letusbeofftothewildcountry again."
Butsolazywere theother two fishes, andsogreedy, thattheykept putting

Now fishermen cast their nets intotheriver; andOver-thoughtful and
Thoughtless wereswimming onahead inquest offoodwhen intheir
folly they blindly rushed into the net. Thoughtful, whowasbehind,
