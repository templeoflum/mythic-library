"United, forest-like."— This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aquarrel concerning water which hadbrought woeupon hiskinsfolk.
Knowing ofthis, hepassed through the air,satcross-legged above theriver
RohinI, andemitted rays ofdarkness, startling hiskinsfolk. Then descending
from mid-air, heseated himself ontheriver-bank andtold thisstory with refer-
ence tothat quarrel. (Only asiimmary isgiven here ;the fulldetails willbe
related intheKunala-j.atakai.) Butonthisoccasion theMaster addressed his
kinsfolk, [328] saying,"Itismeet, sire,that kinsfolk should dwell together in
concord andunity. P'or,when kinsfolk areatone,enemies findnoopportunity.
Not tospeak ofhuman beings, even sense-lacking treesought tostand together.
For inbygone days intheHimalayas atempest struck aSal-forest;yet,
because thetrees, shrubs, bushes, andcreepers ofthat forest were interlaced one
with another, thetempest could notoverthrow even asingle treebutpassed
harmlessly over their heads. Butalone inacourtyard stood amighty tree;and
though ithadmany stems and bi'anches, yet,because itwasnotunited with
other trees, thetempest uprooted itand laid itlow. Wherefore, itismeet that
youtooshould dwell together inconcord and unity." And sosaying, attheir

182 TheJataka. Book I.
Once onatimewheu Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
firstKing Vessavana^ died, andSakka sent anewking toreign inhis
stead. After thechange, thenewKing Vessavana sentword toalltrees
andshrubs andbushes andplants, bidding thetree-fairies each choose out
theabode that likedthem best. Inthose days theBodhisatta hadcome
tolifeasatree-foiry inaSal-forest intheHimalayas. Hisadvice tohis
kinsfolk inchoosiug their habitations wastoshun trees thatstood alone
intheopen, and totakeuptheir abodes allround theabode which he
hadchosen inthat Sal-forest. Hereon thewise ti-ee-fairies, following the
Bodhisatta's advice, took uptheir quarters round his tree. But the
foolish ones said,—"Why should wedwell intheforest? letusrather
seek outthehaunts ofmen, andtakeupourabodes outside villages,
towns, orcapital cities. For fairies who dwell insuch places receive
therichest offerings andthegreatest worship." Sotheydeparted tothe
haunts ofmen,andtookuptheirabode incertain giant treeswhich grew
inanopen space.
Now itfelloutupon adaythat amighty tempest swept over the
country. Naught did itavail thesolitary trees that years hadrooted
them deep inthe soilandthatthey were themightiest trees thatgrew.
Their bi'anches snapped;their stems were broken ;andthey themselves
were uprooted andflung toearth bythetempest. Butwhen itbroke on
theSal-forest ofinterlacing trees, itsfurywasinvain ;for,attack where
itmight, notatreecould itoverthrow.
Theforlorn fairies whose dwellings were destroyed, took their children
intheir arms andjourneyed totheHimalayas. There they told their
sorrows tothe fairies oftheSal-forest, [329]who inturn toldtheBodhi-
satta oftheir sadreturn. "Itwasbecause they hearkened nottothe
words ofwisdom, thattheyhave been brought tothis," saidbe ;andhe
unfolded thetruth inthisstanza :—
United, forest-like, should kinsfolk stand;Thestorm o'erthrows thesolitary tree.
Sospake theBodhisatta ;andwhen his lifewasspent, hepassed away
tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
And theMaster went ontosay,"Thus, sire, reflect howmeet itisthat
knisfolk atanyrateshould beunited, andlovingly dwell together inconcord and
unity." Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying,"TheBuddha's
followers werethefairies ofthose days, and Imyself thewise fairy."

"Fajjunna, thimder !"—This story theMaster toldwhile atJetavana, abovit
therainhecaused tofell. For inthose days, soitissaid, there fellnorain in
Kosala ;thecrops withered;andeverywhere theponds, tanks, andlakes dried
up.Even thepoolofJetavana bytheembattled gateway ofJetavana gaveout;
andthetishandtortoises buried themselves inthemud. Thencame thecrows
andhawks with their lance-like beaks, andbusily picked them outwrithing and
wriggling, anddevoured them.
Ashemarked how thehshes andthetortoises were being destroyed, the
Master's heart wasmoved withcompassion, andheexclaimed, —"This day[330]
must Icause rain tofall." So,when thenight grew day, after attending tohis
bodily needs, hewaited till itwastheproper hour togotheroimd inquest of
alms, and then, girtround byahost oftheBrethren, and perfect with the
perfection ofaBuddha, hewent into Silvattlii foralms. Onhiswayback tothe
monastery intheafternoon from hisround foralms inSavatthi, hestoj^ped upon
thesteps leading down tothetank ofJetavana, andthus addressed theElder
Ananda:—"Bringmeabathing-dress, Ananda;forIwould bathe inthetank of
Jetavana." "But surely, sir,"replied theElder, "thewater isalldried up,and
onlymud isleft." "Great isaBuddha's power, Ananda. Go,bringmethe
bathing-dress," saidtheMaster. SotheElder went andbrought thebathing-
dress, which theMaster donned, using oneend togoround hiswaist, and
covering hisbodyupwith theother. Soclad, hetook hisstand upon thetank-
steps, andexclaimed,—"1would fainbathe inthetank ofJetavana."
That instant theyellow-stone throne ofSakka grew hotbeneath him,andhe
sought todiscover tliecause. Realising what wasthematter, hesummoned the
King oftheStorm-Glouds, andsaid, "TheMaster isstanding onthesteps ofthe
tank ofJetavana, andwishes tobathe. Make haste andpourdown rain ina
single torrent over allthekingdom ofKosala." Obedient toSakka's command,
theKing oftheStorm-Clouds cladhimself inonecloud asanunder garment,
andanother cloud asanouter garment, andchaunting therain-songi,hedarted
forth eastward. And lo !heappeared intheeast asacloud ofthebigness ofa
threshing-floor, which grew andgrew till itwasasbigasahundred, asa
thousand, threshing-floors ;andhethundered andlightened, andbending down
hisfaceandmouth deluged allKosala with torrents ofrain. Unbroken wasthe
downpour, quickly hlling thetank ofJetavana, andstopping onlywhen the
water was level with thetopmost step. Then theMaster bathed inthetank,
andcoming upoutofthewater donned histwoorange-coloured cloths and his
girdle, adjusting hisBuddha-robe around himsoastoleave oneshoulder bare.
Inthis guise hesetforth, surrounded bytheBrethren, andpassed into his
Perfumed Chamber, fragrant with sweet-smelling flowers. Here ontheBuddha-
seathesate,andwhen theBrethren hadperformed their duties, heroseand
exhorted theBrotherhood from thejewelled steps ofhisthrone,, anddismissed
them from hispresence. Passing nowwithin hisown sweet-smelling odorous
chamber, hestretched himself, lion-like, upon hisright side.
Ateven, theBrethren gathered together intheHall ofTruth, anddwelt on
theforbearance andloving-kindness oftheMaster. "When thecrops were
withering, when thepools were drying up,andthehshes and tortoises were in
grievous plight, then didheinhiscompassion come forth asasaviour. Donning
abathing-dress, hestood onthesteps ofthetank ofJetavana, and inalittle

spacemade therain topourdown from theheavens till itseemed liketoover-
whelm allKosala with itstorrents. Andbythetimehereturned totheMonastery,
hehadfreed allalikefrom their tribulations both ofmind andbody."
[331] Sorantheir talkwhen theMaster came forthfrom hisPerfumed Cham-
berintotheHall ofTruth, andasked whatwastheirtheme ofconversation ;and
they toldhim. "This isnotthe first time, Brethren," said theMaster, "that
theBlessed Onehasmade therain tofallinthehour ofgeneral need. Hedid
thelikewhen born intothebrute-creation, inthedayswhen hewasKing ofthe
Fish." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast:—
Once onatime, inthisselfsame kingdom ofKosala and atSavatthi
too,there wasapondwhere thetank ofJetavana now is,—apond fenced
inbyatangle ofclimbing plants. Therein dwelt theBodhisatta, who
hadcome tolifeasafishinthose days. And, then asnow, therewasa
drought intheland ;thecrops withered ;water gave outintankand
pool ;andthe fishes and tortoises buried themselves inthemud. Like-
wise,when thefishes and tortoises ofthispond hadhidden themselves in
itsmud, thecrows andother birds, flocking tothespot, picked them out
with their beaks anddevoured them. Seeing thefate ofhiskinsfolk, and
knowing thatnone buthecould savethem intheir hour ofneed, the
Bodhisatta resolved tomake asolemn Profession ofGoodness, andbyits
efficacy tomake rain fallfrom theheavens soastosave hiskinsfolk from
certain death. So,parting asunder theblack mud, hecame forth,—a
mighty fish,blackened withmud asacasket ofthe finest sandal-wood
which hasbeensmeared with collyrium. Opening hiseyeswhich were as
washen rubies, andlooking uptotheheavens hethusbespoke Pajjunna,
King ofDevas,—"My heart isheavy within meformykinsfolk's sake,
mygood Pajjunna. Howcomes it,pray, that,when Iwhoamrighteous am
distressed formykinsfolk, yousendnorainfrom heaven ?For I,though
bornwhere itiscustomary topreyonone's kinsfolk, have never frommy
youth updevoured any fish,even ofthesizeofagrain ofrice ;norhave
Ieverrobbed asingle living creature ofitslife.Bythetruth ofthismy
Protestation, Icallupon you tosend rainandsuccour mykinsfolk."
Therewithal, hecalled toPajjunna, King ofDevas, asamaster might
calltoaservant, inthisstanza:—[332]
Pajjunna, thunder !Baffle, thwart, thecrow!
Breed sorrow's pangs inhim ;easemeofwoe !
Insuch wise, asamaster might call toaservant, didtheBodhisatta
call toPajjunna, thereby causing heavy rains to falland relieving
numbers from thefear ofdeath. Andwhen his life closed, hepassed
away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

"So this isnotthe first time, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "that theBlessed
Onehascaused therain tofall.Hedidthelike inbygone days,when hewasa

"Thevillage breeds nofearinvie."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while
atJetavana, about alay-brother who lived atSavatthi. Tradition saysthat this
man,whohadentered thePaths andwasanearnest believer, wasoncejourney-
ingalong onsome business orother inthecompany ofaleader ofacaravan;in
thejungle thecarts wereunyoked andalaager wasconstructed;andthegood
manbegan topaceupanddown atthefoot ofacertain treehardbythe
leader.
Now fivehundred robbers, whohadwatched their time,hadsurrounded the
spot,armed with bows, clubs, andother weapons, with theobject oflooting the
encampment. [333] Stillunceasingly thatlay-brother paced toand fro. "Surely
thatmust betheir sentry," saidtherobbers when they noticed him ;"wewill
wait tillheisasleep andthen lootthem." So,being unable tosurpiise the
camp, theystopped where they were. Still that lay-brother kept pacing toand
fro,—allthrough the firstwatch, allthrough themiddle watch, and allthrough
thelastwatch ofthenight. When daydawned, therobbers, whohadnever had
their chance, thi'ew down thestones andclubs which theyhadbrought, and
bolted.
Hisbusiness done, that lay-brother came back toSavatthi, and,approaching
theMaster, asked himthisquestion, "Inguarding themselves. Sir,domenprove
guardians ofothers?"
"Yes, lay-brother. Inguai'ding himself amanguards others;inguarding
others, heguards himself."
"Oh,how well-said, sir, isthisutterance oftheBlessed One !When Iwas
journeying with acaravan-leader, Iresolved toguard myself bypacing toand
froatthefootofatree,andbysodoing Iguarded thewhole caravan."
SaidtheMaster, "Lay-brother, inbygone days toothewiseandgoodguarded
others whilst guarding themselves." And, sosaying, atthelay-brother's request
hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasabrahmin. Arriving atyears ofdiscretion,
hebecame aware oftheevils that spring from Lusts, and soforsook the

world toliveasarecluse inthecountry round theHimalayas. Need of
saltandvinegar having ledhim tomake apilgrimage foralms through
thecountryside, hetravelled inthecourse ofhiswanderings with a
merchant's caravan. When thecaravan halted atacertain spot inthe
forest, hepaced toand froatthefoot ofatree, hard bythecaravan,
enjoying thebliss ofInsight.
Now after supper jfivehundred robbers surrounded thelaager to
plunder it;but,noticing theascetic, they halted, saying, "Ifhesees us,
he'llgivethealarm;wait tillhedrops offtosleep, andthen we'llplunder
them." But allthrough thelivelong night the ascetic continued to
paceupanddown ;andnever achance didtherobbers get !Sothey
flungaway their sticks andstones andshouted tothecaravan-folk; —"Hi,
there!youofthecaravan !Ifithadn't been forthat ascetic walking about
under thetree,we'dhave plundered thelotofyou. Mind and fetehim
tomorrow!" And sosaying, theymade off.When thenight gave place to
light, thepeople .sawtheclubs and .stones which therobbers hadcastaway,
[334] andcame infearandtrembling toasktheBodhisatta with respectful
salutation whether hehadseen therobbers. "Oh, yes, Idid, sirs," he
replied. "And wereyounotalarmed orafraid atthesight ofsomany
robbers]" "No," saidtheBodhisatta; "the sight ofrobbers causes what
isknown asfearonly tothe rich. Asforme,—Iampenniless; why
should Ibeafraid ]Whether Idwell invillage orinforest, Inever have
any fear ordread." And therewithal, toteach them theTruth, he
repeated tliisstanza :—
The village breeds nofear inme;
Noforests medismay.
I'vewonbyloveandcharity
Salvation's perfect way.
When theBodhisatta hadthus taught theTruth inthis stanza tothe
people ofthecaravan, peace filled their hearts, andtheyshewed him
honour andveneration. Allhislifelonghedeveloped theFour Excellences,
andthenwasre-born intotheBrahma Realm.
Hislesson ended, theMaster shewed theconnexion andidentified theBirth
bysaying, "The Buddha's followers were thecaravan-folk ofthose days, and I
theascetic."

''Bulls first,and trees."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavaua
about sixteen wonderful dreams. For inthelastwatch ofonenight (sotra-
dition says) theKing ofKosala, whohadbeen asleep allthenight, dreamed
sixteen great dreams, [335] andwokeupingreat fright andalarm astowhat
theymight portend forhim. Sostrong wasthefearofdeath uponhimthathe
could not stir,butlaythere huddled uponhisbed. Now,when thenight grew
light, hisbrahmins andchaplains came tohimandwithdueobeisance asked
whether hismajesty hadslept well.
"How could Isleep well,mydirectors?" answered theking. "For just at
daybreak Idreamed sixteen wonderful dreams, and Ihave been interror ever
since !Tellme,mydirectors, what itallmeans."
"We shall beable tojudge, onhearing them."
Then theking toldthem hisdreams, andasked what those visions woidd
entail upon him.
Thebrahmins fell a-wringing their hands! "Why wring your hands,
brahmins?" asked theking. "Because, sire, these are evildreams." "What
willcome ofthem?" saidtheking. "One ofthree calamities, —harm toyour
kingdom, toyour life,ortoyour riches." "Isthere aremedy, oristhere not?"
"Undoubtedly these dreams inthemselves aresothreatening astobewithout
remedy ;butnone the lesswewill tindaremedy forthem. Otherwise, what
boots ourmuch study andlearning I""What thendoyoupropose todoto
avert theevil?" "Wherever fourroads meet, wewould offer sacrifice, sire."
"Aly directors," cried theking inhisterror, "my life isinyourhands; make
haste andworkmysafety." "Large sums ofmoney, andlarge supplies offood
ofevery kind willbeours," thought theexultant brahmins; and, bidding the
kinghavenofeai',theydeparted from thepalace. Outside thetown theyduga
sacrihcial pitand collected ahost offourfooted creatures, perfect andwithout
blemish, andamultitude ofbirds. But stillthey discovered something lacking,
andback theykeptcoming totheking toaskforthisthatandtheother. Now
their doings werewatched byQueen Mallika, whocame tothekingandasked
whatmade these brahmins keepcoming tohim.
"Ienvy you," saidtheking; "asnake inyour ear,andyounottoknow of
it!""What doesyour majesty mean?" "Ihave dreamed, ohsuch unlucky
dreams !Thebrahmins tellmethey point tooneofthree calamities ;andthey
areanxious tooffer sacrifices toavert the evil.And this iswhat brings them
here sooften." "But hasyourmajesty consulted theChiefBrahmin both ofthis
world andoftheworld ofdevas?" "Who, pray,mayhebe,mydear?" asked the
king. "Know younotthat chiefest personage ofalltheworld, theall-knowing
andpure, thespotless master-brahmin ?Surely, he,theBlessed One, willunder-
stand your dreams. Go,askhim." "And soIwill,myqueen," saidtheking.
Andaway hewent tothemonastery, saluted theMaster, andsatdown. "What,
pray, brings your majesty here soearly inthemorning?" asked theMaster in
hissweet tones. "Sir," said theking, "just before daybreak [336] Idreamed
sixteen wonderful dreams, which soterrified methat Itoldthem tothe
brahmins. They toldmethatmydreams boded evil,andthat toavert the
threatened calamity theymust offer sacrifice wherever fom-roads met.And so
they arebusywith their preparations, andmany living creatures have thefear
ofdeath before their eyes. But Ipray you,who arethechiefest personage in

brahmins toprophesy asthey did. No, itwasgreed ofgain, andtheinsight
that isbred ofcovetousness, thatshaped alltheir self-seeking utterances."
Thus didtheMaster expound theimjiort ofthese sixteen great dreams,
adding,—"You, sire,arenotthe first tohave these dreams; theyweredreamed
bykings ofbygone days also ;and,then asnow, thebrahmins found inthem a
pretext forsacrifices ;whereupon, attheinstance ofthewiseandgood, the
Bodhisatta wasconsulted, andthedreams wereexpounded bythem ofoldtime

injustthesamemanner astheyhavenowbeenexpounded." And sosaying, at
theking's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abralimin intheNorth country. When hecame
toyears ofdiscretion herenounced theworld forahermit's life;hewon
thehigher Knowledges andtheAttainments, anddwelt intheHimalaya
country inthebliss thatcomes from Insight.
Inthose days, injust thesame manner, Brahmadatta dreamed these
dreams atBenares, andenquired ofthebrahmins concerning them. And
thebrahmins, then asnow, settowork atsacrifices. Amongst themwas
ayoung brahmin oflearning andwisdom, apupil oftheking'.s chaplain,
whoaddressed hismaster thus :—"Master, youhave taught metheThree
Vedas. Isthere nottherein atextthatsays'The slaying ofonecreature
giveth not lifetoanother'?" "My son, thismeans money tous,agreat
deal ofmoney. You onlyseem anxious tospare theking's treasury!"
"Do asyou will, master," saidtheyoung brahmin; "asforme,towhat
endshall Itarry longer herewithyou 1"And sosaying, helefthim,and
betook himself totheroyal pleasaunce.
That selfsame day the Bodhisatta, knowing all this, thought to
himself:—"If Ivisi-itto-day thehaunts ofmen, Ishall work thedeliver-
ance ofagreat multitude from their bondage." So,passing through the
air,healighted intheroyal pleasaunce andseated himself, radiant asa
statue ofgold, upon theCeremonial Stone. Theyoung brahmin drew
near and with dueobeisance seated himself bytheBodhisatta inall
friendliness. Sweet converse passed ;andtheBodhisatta asked whether
theyoung brahmin thought theking ruled righteously. "Sir,"answered
theyoung man, "the king isrighteous himself; butthebrahmins make
him sidewith evil. Being consulted bytheking astosixteen dreams
which hehaddreamed, thebrahmins clutched attheopportunity for
sacrifices [34-1:] and settowork thereon. Oh, sir,would itnotbeagood
thing thatyoushould offer tomakeknown totheking therealimport of
hisdreams andsodeliver great numbers ofcreatures from theirdreadf
"But,myson, Idonotknow theking, norheme. Still, ifheshould
come hereandaskme,Iwill tellhim." "Iwillbring theking, sir," said
theyoung brahmin ;"ifyouwillonlybesogood astowait hereaminute
tillIcome back." Andhaving gained theBodhisatta's consent, hewent
before theking, and saidthat there hadalighted intheroyal pleasaunce
anair-travelling ascetic, who saidhewould expound theking's dreams;
would nothismajesty relate them tothisascetic ?
When thekingheard this,herepaired atonce tothepleasaunce with

side,andasked whether itwastruethatheknew whatwould come ofhis
dreams. "Certainly, sire," saidtheBodhisatta ;"but first letmehear
thedreams asyoudreamed them." "Readily, sir,"answered theking;
andhebegan asfollows :—
Bulls first,and tree.s, andcows, and calves.
Horse, dish, she-jackal, waterpot,
Apond, raw rice,andsaiulal-wood.
Andgourds that sank, andstones thatswam,—
andsoforth, ending uj)with
And wolves inpanic-fear ofgoats.
And hismajesty went ontotellhisdreams injust thesamemanner as
that inwhich King Pasenadi haddesci'ibed them. [345]
"Enough," saidtheGreat Being; "you have nothing tofearordread
from allthis." Having thus reassured theking, andhaving freed agreat
multitude from bondage, theBodhisatta again took \iphisposition inmid-
air,whence heexhorted theking and established him intheFive
Commandments, ending with these words:—"Henceforth, Oking, join
notwith thebi-ahmins inslaughtering animals forsacrifice." Histeach-
ingended, theBodhisatta passed straight through theairtohisown
abode. And theking, remaining stedfast intheteaching heliadheard,
passed away after alifeofalms-giving andother good works tofare
according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said,"You have nothing tofearfrom these
di'eams; away with the sacrifice!" Having had the sacrifice removed, and
having saved thelives ofamultitude ofcreatures, heshewed theconnexion and
identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wastheking ofthose days, Sariputta
theyoung Brahmin, and Itheascetic."

"Both squint."- -This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana, about
amiserly LordHigh Treasurer. Hard bythecityofRajagaha, aswearetold,
wasatownnamed Jagghery, andheredwelt acertain LordHigh Treasurer,
known asthe^Millionaire Miser, whowasworth eighty crores! Notsomuch as
thetiniest drop ofoilthatablade ofgrass willtake up,didheeither giveaway
orconsume forhisownenjoyment. Bohemade nouseofallhiswealth either
forhisfamily orforsages andbrahmins :itremained unenjoyed, —likeapool
haunted bydemons. Now, itfelloutonadaythat theMaster arose atdawn
moved with agi'eat compassion, andashereviewed those ripe forconversion
throughout theuniverse, hebecame aware that thisTreasurer with hiswife
some fourhundred milesaway were destined totread thePaths ofSalvation.
Now thedaybefore, theLordHigh Treasurer hadgone hiswaytothepalace
towaitupon theking,andwasonhishomeward waywhen hesawacoimtry-
bumpkin, whowasquiteempty within, eating acake stuffed with gruel. The
sight awoke acraving within him !But, arrived athisown house, [346] he
thought tohimself,— "If Isay Ishould likeastuffed cake, awhole host of
people willwant tosharemymeal ;andthatmeans getting through ever so
much ofmyriceandgheeandsugar. Imustn't sayaword toasoul." Sohe
walked about, wrestling with hiscraving. Ashour after hour passed, hegrew
yellower andyellower, andtheveins stood outlikecords onhisemaciated frame.
Unable atlast tobear itanylonger, hewent tohisownroom andlaydown
hugging hisbed. But stillnotawordwould hesaytoasoul forfearofwasting
hissubstance !Well, hiswifecame tohim, and,stroking hisback, said :"What
isthematter, myhusband^"
"Nothing," said he."Perhaps thekinghasbeen cross toyou?" "No, he
hasnot." "Have your children or.servants done anything toannoy you?"
"Nothing ofthat kind, either." "Well, then, haveyouacraving foranytliing?"
But stillnotawordwould hesay,—allbecause ofhispreposterous fearthathe
might waste hissubstance; but laythere speechless onhisbed. "Speak,
husband," saidthewife; "tellmewhatyouhave acraving for." "Yes," saidhe
with agulp, "Ihave gotacraving foronething." "And what isthat,my
husband?" "Ishould likeastuffed cake toeat!" "Now whynothave said so
atonce ?You're richenough !I'llcook cakes enough tofeast thewhole town
ofJagghery." "Why trouble about them? Theymustwork toearn theirown

"Then, I'llcook justenough forourownhousehold." "How extravagant you
areI""Very good, I'llcookonlyenough forourchildren." "Why bother about
them?" "Very good then, I'llonlyprovide forourtwo selves." "Why should
youbeinit?" "Then, I'llcook justenough foryoualone," saidthewife.
"Softly," saidtheLordHigh Treasurer; "there arealotofpeople onthe
watch forsigns ofcooking inthis place. Pick outbroken rice,—being careful to

Obedient tohiswishes, thewifehad allthenecessary things carried up,
climbed allthewayupherself, senttheservants away, anddespatched word to
theTreasurer tocome. Upheclimbed, shutting andbolting door after door as

Now intheearly morning, the ]\Iaster hadsaid totheElder Great Mog-
gallana,—"Moggallana, thisMiser Millionaire [347] inthetown ofJagghery near
Rajagaha, wanting toeatcakes himself, issoafraid ofletting others know, that
heishaving them cooked forhim rightupontheseventh story. Gothither;
convert theman toself-denial, andbytranscendental power transport husband
and wife, cakes, milk, gheeand all,here toJetavana. Thisday Iandthefive
hundred Brethren willstay athome, and Iwillmake thecakes furnish them
with ameal."
Obedient totheMaster's bidding, theElder bysupernatural power passed to
thetown ofJagghery, andrested inmid-air before thechamber-window, duly
clad inhisunder andouter cloths, bright asajewelled image. Theunexpected
sight oftheEldermade theLordHigh Treasurer quake with fear. Thought he
tohimself, "Itwas toescape such visitors that Iclimbed uphere: andnow
there's oneofthem atthewindow !"And, failing torealise thecomprehension of
thatwhich hemust needs comprehend, hesputtered with rage, likesugar and
saltthrown onthe fire,ashebiu'st outwith—"What willyou get,sage,byyour
simply standing inmid-air? Why, youmaypaceupanddown tillyou've made
apath inthepathless air,—andyetyou'll stillgetnothing."
TheElder began topace toandfroinhisplace intheair!"What willyou
getbypacing toandfro?" saidtheTreasurer! "Youmay sitcross-legged in
meditation inthe air,—but still you'll getnothing." TheElder satdown with
legscrossed !Then said theTreasurer, "What willyougetbysitting there ?
Youmaycome andstand onthewindow-sill ;buteven thatwon't getyouany-
thing!" TheElder took hisstand onthewindow-sill. "What willyougetby
standing onthewindow-sill? Why, youmay belch smoke, andyetyou'll still
getnothing!"saidtheTreasurer. Then theElder belched forthsmoke tillthe
whole palace was filled with it.TheTreasurer's eyesbegan tosmart asthough
pricked with needles ;and, forfearatlastthat hishouse might besetonfire,he
checked himself fromadding—"You won't getanything even ifyouburst into
flames." Thought hetohimself, "This Elder ismost persistent! Hesimply
won't goaway empty-handed !Imust have justonecake given him." Sohe
said tohiswife,"My dear, cookone little cakeandgive ittothesage togetrid
ofhim."
Soshemixed quite alittledough inacrock. Butthedough swelled and
swelled till itfilled thewhole crock, andgrew tobeagreat bigcake! "What a
lotyoumust haveused!"exclaimed theTreasurer atthesight. Andhehimself
with thetipofaspoon took avery little ofthedough, andputthat intheoven
tobake. Butthat tinypiece ofdough grew larger than the firstlump ;and,one
after another, every piece ofdough hetookbecame ever sobig !Then helost
heart and said tohiswife,"You givehimacake, dear." But, assoon asshe
tookonecakefrom thebasket, atonce alltheother cakes stuck fasttoit.So
shecried outtoherhusband that allthecakes hadstuck together, andthatshe
could notpartthem.
"Oh, I'llsoon ptirtthem," said he,—butfound hecould not!
Then husband andwifebothtookhold ofthemass ofcakes atthecorner and
tried togetthem apart. Buttugasthey might, they couldmake nomore
impression together than they didsingly, onthemass. Now astheTreasurer
waspulling away atthecakes, heburst intoaperspiration, and hiscraving left
him. Then saidhetohiswife,"Idon'twant thecakes;[348] givethem, basket
and all,tothis ascetic." Andsheapproached theElder with thebasket inher
hand. Then theElder pi-eached thetruth tothe pair, andproclaimed the
excellence oftheThree Gems. And, teaching that giving wastrue sacrifice, he
made thefruits ofcharity andother goodworks toshine forth even asthefull-
moon intheheavens. WonbytheElder's words, theTreasurer said, "Sir,come
hither and sitonthiscouch toeatyour cakes."
"Lord High Treasurer," said theElder, "the All-Wise Buddha with five
hundred Brethren sitsinthemonastery waiting ameal ofcakes. Ifsuch be
yourgood pleasure, Iwould askyoutobring your wifeandthecakes with you,
and letusbegoing totheMaster." "But where, sir, istheMaster atthepresent

time?" "Five andforty leagues a\Yay, inthemonastery atJetavana." "How-
arewetogetallthatway, sir,without losing alongtimeontheroad?" "If it
beyour pleasure, Lord High Treasurer, Iwilltransport youthither bymy
transcendental powers. Thehead ofthestaircase inyour house shall remain
where itis,butthebottom shall beatthemain-gate ofJetavana. Inthiswise
will Itransport you totheMaster inthetimewhich ittakes togodownstairs."
"Sobeit,sir,"saidtheTreasurer.
Then theElder, keeping thetopofthestaircase where itwas,commanded,
saying,—"Let thefootofthestaircase beatthemain-gate ofJetavana." And
soitcame topass !InthiswaydidtheElder transport theTreasurer and his
wife toJetavana quicker thantheycould getdown thestairs.
Then husband andwifecame before theMaster andsaidmeal-time hadcome.
And theMaster, passing into theRefectory, satdown ontheBuddha-seat
prepared forhim, with theBrotherhood gathered round. Then theLordHigh
Treasurer poured theWater ofDonation over thehands oftheBrotherhood
with theBuddha atitshead, whilst hiswifeplaced acake inthealms-bowl of
theBlessed One. Ofthishetookwhat sufficed tosupport life,asalsodidthefive
hundred Brethren. Next theTreasurer wentround ottering milkmixed withghee
andhoney andjagghery ;andthe]\Iastcr andtheBrotherhood brought theirmeal
toaclose. Lastly theTreasurer andhiswife atetlieir fill,but stillthereseemed
noendtothecakes. Evenwhen alltheBrethren andthescrap-eaters through-
outthemonastery had allhadashare, still there wasnosign oftheend
approaching. Sothey toldtheMaster, saying, "Sir,thesupply ofcakes gi'ows
nosmaller."
"Then throw themdown bythegreat gate ofthemonastery."
Sotheythrew them away inacave notfarfrom thegateway ;and tothis
dayaspot called 'The Crock-Cake,' isshown attheextremity ofthat cave.
TheLord High Treasurer and hiswifeapproached andstood before the
Blessed One,whoreturned thanks ;andattheclose ofhiswords ofthanks, the
pairattained Fruition oftheFirst Path ofSalvation. Then, taking their leave
oftheMaster, thetwomounted thestairs atthegreat gateandfound themselves
intheirownhome once more. [349] Afterwards, theLordHigh Treasurer
lavished eighty crores ofmoney solely ontheFaith theBuddha taught.
NextdaythePerfect Buddha, returning toJetavana after around foralms
inSavatthi, delivered aBuddha-discourse totheBrethren before retiring tothe
seclusion ofthePerfumed Chamber. Atevening, theBrethren gathered together
intheHall ofTruth, andexclaimed, "How great isthepower oftheElder
Moggallana !Inamoment heconverted amiser tocharity, brouglit himwith
thecakes toJetavana, sethimbefore theMaster, andstablished him insalva-
tion.How great isthepower oftheElder!"Asthey sattalking thus ofthe
goodness oftheElder, theMaster entered, and,onenquiry, was told ofthe
subject oftheir talk. "Brethren," said he,"aBrother who istheconverter ofa
household, should apj^roach that household without causing itannoyance or
vexation,—even asthebeewhen itsucks thenectar from theflower; insuch
wise should hedraw nigh todeclare theexcellence oftheBuddha." And in
praise oftheElder Moggallana, herecited thisstanza :—
Like bees, thatharm noflower's scent orhue
But, laden with itshoney, flyaway,
So,sage, within thyvillage walk thywayi.
Then, tosetforth stillmore theElder's goodness, hesaid,—"This isnotthe
firsttime, Brethren, thatthemiserly Treasurer hasbeen converted byMoggal-
lana. Inother days tootheElder converted him,andtaught himhowdeeds
andtheir effects arelinked together." Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, there

haunted bydemons. Yet, forseven generations, hisancestors hadbeen
bountiful, giving freely oftheir best ;but,when hebecame Treasurer, he
broke through thetraditions ofhishouse. Burning down thealmonry and
driving thepoorwithblows from hisgates, hehoarded hiswealth.
Oneday,when hewasreturning Irom attendance ontheking, hesaw

Sohewalked about, keeping histhirst under. But, astimewore oji,he

thewatch;and tosend out forthe spirits and sitanddrink ithere,
isoutofthequestion." Soheproduced onesingle penny, andsent a
slave tofetchhimajarofspirits from thetavern. When theslavecame
back, hemade himgofrom thetown totheriverside andputthejar
down inaremote thicket. "Now beoff!" said he,andmade theslave
waitsome distance off,while hefilled hiscupand fell to.
Now theTreasurer's father, who forhischarity andother goodworks
hadbeen re-born asSakka intheRealm ofDevas, was atthatmoment
wondering whether hisbounty was stillkeptupornot,andbecame aware
ofthestopping ofhisbounty, andofhisson's behaviour. Hesawhow
hisson,breaking through the traditions ofhishouse, hadburnt the
almonry totheground, haddriven thepoor with blows from hisgates,
andhow, inhismiserliness, fearing toshare with others, that sonhad
stolen away toathicket todrink byhimself. Moved bythesight, Sakka
cried, "Iwillgotohimandmakemysonseethatdeeds must have their
consequences; Iwillwork hisconversion, andmake him charitable and
worthy ofre-birth intheRealm ofDevas." Sohecamedown toearth,
andoncemore trod theways ofmen, putting onthesemblance ofthe
Treasurer Illlsa, with the latter's lameness, andcrookback, and squint.
Inthis guise, heentered thecityofRajagaha andmade hisway tothe


No. 78. 199
palace-gate, where hebade hiscoming beannounced totheking. "Let
him approach," said theking ;andheentered and stood with due
obeisance before hismajesty.
"What brings youhere atthisunusual hour, LordHigh Treasurer]"
saidtheking. "Iamcome, Sire,because Ihave inmyhouse eighty crores
oftreasure. Deign tohave them carried tofilltheroyal treasury."
"Nay,myLord Treasurer; [351] thetreasure withinmypalace isgreater
than this." "Ifyou, sire, willnothave it,Ishall give itaway towhom I
will." "Dosobyallmeans, Treasurer," saidtheking. "Sobeit,sire,"
said thepretended Illisa, aswith dueobeisance hedeparted from the
presence totheTreasurer's house. Theservants allgathered round him,
butnotonecould tellthat itwasnottheir real master. Entering, he
stood onthethreshold andsent fortheporter, towhom hegave orders
that ifanybody resembling himself should appear andclaim tobemaster
ofthehouse they should soiindly cudgel such aoneandthrow him out.
Then, mounting thestairs totheupper story, hesatdown onagorgeous
couch andsent forlUisa's wife.When shecame hesaidwith asmile,
"Mydear, letusbebountiful."
Atthese words, wife, children, andservants allthought, "It'salong
time since hewas thiswayminded. Hemust have been drinking tobe
sogood-natured andgenerous to-day." And hiswife said tohim, "Beas
bountiful asyou please, myhusband." "Send forthe crier," said he,
"and bidhimproclaim bybeat ofdrum allthrough thecitythateveryone
whowants gold, silver, diamonds, peai-ls, andthe like, istocome tothe
house ofIllisa theTreasurer." His wife didashebade, andalarge
crowd soon assembled atthedoor carr3'ing baskets and sacks. Then
Sakka bade thetreasure-chambers bethrown open, and cried, "This ismy
gift toyou ;takewhat you willandgoyour ways." And thecrowd
seized ontheriches there stored, andpiledthem inheaps onthefloorand
tilled thebagsandvessels theyhadbrought, andwent offladen with the
spoils. Among them wasacountryman whoyoked Illlsa's oxen toIllTsa's
carriage, filled itwith theseven things ofprice, andjourneyed outofthe
cityalong thehighroad. Ashewent along, hedrew near thethicket,
andsang theTreasurer's praises inthese words:—"Mayyou livetobea
hundred, mygood lord IllTsa !What youhavedone formethisdaywill
enable metolivewithout doing another sti'oke ofwork. Whose were
these oxenl—yours. Whose was this carriage?—yours. Whose the
wealth inthecarriage"?—yours again. Itwasnofather ormother who
gavemeallthis ;no,itcame solely from you,mylord."
These words filled theLordHigh Treasurer with fearandtrembling.
"Why, thefellow ismentioning myname inhistalk," saidhetohimself.
"Can thekinghave been distributing mywealth tothepeople?" [352]
Atthebai-ethought hebounded from thebush, and, recognizing hisown

oxen aud cart, seized theoxen bythecord, crying, "Stop, fellow; these
oxenand thiscartbelong tonie."Down leaped themanfrom thecart,
angrily exclaiming, "You rascal! Illisa, theLord High Treasurer, is
giving away hiswealth toallthecity.What hascome toyou 1"Andhe
sprang attheTreasurer andstruck himontheback likeafalling thunder-
bolt,andwent offwith the cart. Illisa picked himself up,trembling i»
every limb, wiped offthemud, andhurrying after hiscart, seized hold of
it.Again thecountryman gotdown, and seizing Illisa bythehair,
doubled himupandthumped himabout thehead forsometime;then tak-
inghimbythethroat, heflunghimback thewayhehadcome, anddrove
off. Sobered bythisrough usage, Illisa hurried offhome. There, seeing
folkmaking offwith thetreasure, hefelltolaying hands onhere aman
andthere aman, shrieking, "Hi! what's this? Istheking despoiling
me?"And everymanhelaidhands onknocked himdown. Bruised
andsmarting, hesought totakerefuge inhisownhouse, when theporters
stopped him with, "Holloa, you rascal !Where inight youbegoing 1"
And firstthrashing himsoundly with bamboos, they took their master by
thethroat andthrew himoutofdoors. "There isnone buttheking left
toseemerighted," groaned Illisa, andbetook himself tothe palace.
"Why, ohwhy, sire," hecried, "have youplundered melikethis?"
"Nay, itwasnot I,myLord Treasurer," said theking. "Did you
notyoiirself comeanddeclare your intention ofgiving your wealth away,
ifIwould notaccej^t it?And didyounotthen sendthecrierround and
carry outyour threat?""Ohsire,indeed itwasnotIthatcame toyou
onsuchanerrand. Your majesty knows hownearand close Iam,and
howInever giveaway somuch asthetiniest drop ofoilwhich ablade of
grass willtake up.May itplease your majesty tosend forhimwhohas
givenmysubstance away, andtoquestion himonthematter."
Then theking sent forSakka. And soexactly alike were thetwo
that neither theking norhiscourt could tellwhich wastherealLord
High Treasurer. Said themiser Illisa, "Who, and what, sire, isthis
Treasurer? /am theTreasurer."
"Well, really Ican't saywhich isthereal Illisa," saidtheking. "Is
there anybody whocandistinguish them forcertain?" "Yes, sire,my
wife." Sothewifewas sent forandasked which ofthetwowasher
husband. And shesaidSakka washerhusband andwent tohisside.
[353] Then inturn Illlsa's children andservants were brought inand
asked thesame question ;and allwith oneaccord declared Sakka wasthe
realLordHigh Treasurer. Here itflashed across Illlsa's mind thathe
hadawartonhishead, hidden among hishair, theexistence ofwhich was
known only tohisbarber. So,asalastresource, heasked that hisbarber
might besent fortoidentify him.Now atthistime theBodhisatta was
hisbarber. Accordingly, thebarber wassent forandasked ifhecould


No. 78. 201
distinguish the realfrom the fal^e llHsa. "Icould tell, sire," said he,
"ifImight examine their heads." "Then look atboth their heads,"
saidtheking. Ontheinstant Sakka caused awart toi-iseonhishead !
After examining thetwo,theBodhisatta reported that, asboth alike had
gotwarts ontheir heads, hecouldn't forthe lifeofhimsaywhich wasthe
realman. And therewithal heuttered thisstanza:—
Both squint ;both halt;bothmen arehunchbacks too;
And both have warts alike !1cannot tell
Which ofthetwothereal lillsa is.
Hearing hislasthope thus failhim, theLordHigh Treasurer fellintoa
tremble ;andsuchwas hisintolerable anguish atthe lossofhisbeloved
riches, thatdown hefellinaswoon. Thereupon Sakka jjutforth his
transcendental powers, and, rising inthe air,addressed theking thence
inthese words: "Not IllTsaam I,Oking, butSakka." Then those
around wiped Illlsa's faceanddashed water over him. Recovering, he
rose tohisfeetandbowed totheground before Sakka, King ofDevas.
Then saidSakka, "IllTsa, mine was thewealth, notthine; Iamthy
father, andthou artmyson. Inmylifetime Iwasbountiful toward the
poorand rejoiced indoing good;wherefore, Iamadvanced tothishigh
estate andambecome Sakka. But thou, walking not iiimyfootsteps,
artgrown aniggard andaverymiser; thou hastburntmyalmonry to
theground, driven thepoorfrom thegate,andhoarded thy I'iches. Thou
hastnoenjoyment thereof thyself, norhasanyotherhuman being; [354]
butthy stoi-e isbecome likeapoolhaunted bydemons, whei-eat noman
may slake histhirst. Albeit, ifthou wiltrebuild minealmonry andshow
bounty tothepoor, itshall beaccounted tothee forrighteousness. But,
ifthou wilt not,then will Isti'ip thee ofallthatthou hast,andcleave thy
headwith thethunderbolt ofIndra, andthou shalt die."
Atthisthreat IllTsa, quaking forhis life, cried out, "Henceforth I
willbebountiful." AndSakka accepted hispromise, and, stillseated in
mid-air, established hissonintheCommandments andpreached theTruth
tohim,departing thereafter tohisownabode. And IllTsa wasdiligent in
almsgiving andother good works, andsoassured hisre-birth thereafter in
heaven.
"Brethren," saidtheMaster, "this isnotthe firsttime thatMoggallana has
converted themiserly Treasurer ;inbygone days toothesamemanwascon-
verted byhim." Hislesson ended, heshewed theconnexion and identified the
Birth bysaying, "This miserly Treasurer wasthelUlsa ofthose days,Moggallana
wasSakka, King ofDevas, Ananda wastheking,and Imyself thebarber."

"y/egaoe therubbers time."—This story was told liytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about acertain Minister. He, 'tissaid, ingratiated himself with the
king, and, after collecting theroyal revenue inaborder-village, privily arranged
with aband ofrobbers thathewould march themen offinto thejungle,
leaving the\illage fortherascals toplunder,—oncondition thattheygavehim
halfthebooty. Accordingly, atdaybreak when theplacewas leftunprotected,
downcame therobbers, whoslewandatethecattle, looted thevillage, andwere
offwith their booty before hecame back atevening with hisfollowers. But it
wasa\'ery short time before hisknavery leaked outandcame totheearsofthe
king. And theking sent forhim, and, ashisguilt was manifest, hewas
degraded andanother headman put inhisplace. Then thekingwent tothe
Master atJetavana andtoldhimwhat hadhappened. "Sire," saidtheBlessed
One, "theman hasonlyshewn thesame disposition nowwhich heshewed in
bygone days." Then attheking's request hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta Avas reigning inBenares, he
api)ointed acertain Minister tobeheadman ofaborder-village ;andevery-
thingcame topass asintheabove case.Now inthose days theBodhisatta
wasmaking theround oftlieborder- villages inthewayoftrade, [355] and
hadtaken uphisabode inthatvery village. Andwhen theheadman was
marching hismenback atevening withdrums a-beating, heexclaimed,
"This scoundrel, who privily egged ontherobbers tolootthe village, has
waited tilltheyhadmade offtothejungle again, andnowback hecomes
withdrums a-beating,—feigning ahappy ignorance ofanything wrong
having happened." And, sosaying, heuttered thisstanza:—
Hegave therobbers time todrive andslay
The cattle, burn thehouses, captm-e folk;And then withdrums a-beating, home hemarched,—Asonnomore, forsuch ason isdead^.
Insuch wise didtheBodhisatta condemn theheadman. Notlong
after, thevillany wasdetected, andtherascal waspunished bytheking
ashiswickedness deserved.

"This isnotthe first time, sire," saidtheking, "that hehasbeeu ofthis

"Yoaoaiuded your j»/Yj;^;r'.s.s."— This story was told l)ytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about acertain braggart among theBrethren. Tradition saysthathe
used togather round himBrethren ofallages,andgoal)out deluding everyone
with lying boasts about his nol)le descent. "Ah, Brethren," hewould .say,
"there's nofamily sonolile asmine, nolineage sopeerless. Iamascion of
thehighest ofprincely lines; noman ismyequal inbirth orancestral e.state;
there isabsolutely noendtothegoldand silver andother treasures wepossess.
Ourvery slaves andmenials arefedonriceandmeat-stews, andareclad inthe
bestBenares cloth, with thechoicest Benares perfumes toperfimie themselves
withal ;—whilst I,because 1have joined theBrotherhood, [3.36] have tocontent
myself with this vilefareandthis vilegarb."
Butanother Brother, aftei- enquiring into hisfamily estate, exposed tothe
Brethren theemptiness ofthis pretension. SotheBrethren met intheHall
ofTi'uth, andtalkbegan astohow that Brother, inspite ofhisvows toleave
worldly things andcleave only tothesaving Truth, wasgoing about deluding
theBrethren with hislying boasts. A\'hilst thefellow's sinfulness wasbeing dis-
cussed, theMaster entered andenquired what their topic was.Andthey told
him. "This isnotthe first time. Brethren," saidtheMaster, "that hehasgone
about boasting; inbygone days toohewent about boasting anddeluding
people." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin inamarket-to w^nintheNorth country,
andwhen hewa.sgrown uphestudied under ateacher ofworld-wide fame
atTakkasila. There helearnt theThree Vedas andtheEighteen Branches
ofknowledge, andcompleted hiseducation. Andhebecame known asthe
sage Little Bowman. Leaving Takkasila, hecame totheAndhra country
insearch ofpractical exj^erience. Now, itliap])ened that inthisBirth the
Bodhisatta wassomewhat ofacrooked little dwarf, and liethought to
himself, "IfImakemyappearance before anyking, he'ssure toaskwhat
adwarf likemeisgood for ;whyshould Inotuseatallbroad fellow as

personality?" Sohebetook himself totheweavers' quarter, and there
espying ahuge weaver named Bhimasena, saluted him,asking theman's
name. "Bhimasena' ismyname," saidtheweaver. "Andwhatmakes a
finebigman likeyouwork atsosorry ati-adel" "Because Ican't geta
living anyother way." "Weave nomore, friend. Thewhole continent
canshewnosuch archer asIam ;butkings would scornmebecause Iam
adwarf. And soyou, friend, must betheman tovaunt your prowess
with thebow,andtheking willtakeyouinto hispay[357] andmake you
plyyour calling regularly. Meantime Ishall bebehind you toperform
theduties that arelaidupon yoii,andsoshall earnmyliving inyour
shadow. Inthismanner weshallboth ofusthrive andprosper. Only do
asItellyou." "Done with you," saidtheother.
Accordingly, theBodhisatta took theweaver withhim toBenares,
acting asalittle page ofthebow,andputting theother inthefront ;and
when theywere atthegates ofthepalace, hemade himsendword ofhis
coming totheking. Being summoned into theroyal presence, thepair
entered together andbowing stood before theking. "What brings you
here?" saidtheking. "1amamighty archer," saidBhimasena; "there is
noarcher likemeinthewhole continent." "What paywould youwant
toentermyservice?" "Athousand pieces afortnight, sire.""What is
thisman ofyours 1""He'smylittle page, sire." "Very well, entermy
service."
SoBhimasena entered theking's service;but itwastheBodhisatta who
didallhiswork forhim.Now inthose days there w^asatiger inaforest
inKasi which blocked afrequented high-road andhaddevoured many
victims. When thiswasreported totheking, hesent forBhimasena and
asked whether hecould catch thetiger.
"How could Icallmyself anarcher, sire, ifIcouldn't catch atiger?"
Thekinggavehim largesse andsenthimontheerrand. Andhome to
theBodhisatta came Bhimasena with thenews. "All right," said the
Bodhisatta; "away yougo,myfriend." "But areyounotcoming too?"
"No, Iwon't go;but I'lltellyoualittle plan." "Please do,myfriend."
"Well don'tyouberashandapproach the tiger's lair alone. What you
willdoistomuster astrong band ofcountryfolk tomarch tothespotwith

aroused, you bolt into thethicket and liedown flatonyour face. The
countryfolk willbeat thetiger todeath ;andassoon asheisquite dead,

tiger before Icould getbackwithmycreeper.' Then thecountryfolk will
bevery frightened andbribe youheavily nottoreport them totheking;
you willbecredited with slaying thetiger ;andtheking toowillgiveyou
lotsofmoney."
"Very good," saidBhimasena ;and offhewentandslew thetiger just
astheBodhisatta had toldhim. Having thusmade theroad safe for
travellers, back hecame with alarge following toBenares, andsaid tothe
king, "Ihave killed thetiger, sire ;theforest issafe fortravellers now."
Well-pleased, theking loaded himwith gifts.
Another day, tidings came that acertain roadwas infested with a
buffalo, andthekingsentBhimasena tokill it.Following theBodhisatta's
directions, hekilled thebuffalo inthesamewayasthetiger, andreturned
totheking,whooncemore gavehim lotsofmoney. Hewasagreat lord
now. Intoxicated byhisnew honours, hetreated theBodhisatta with
contempt, andscorned tofollow hisadvice, saying, "Icangetonwithout
you.Doyouthink there's nomanbutyourself?" Thisandmany other
harsh things didhesaytotheBodhisatta.
Now, afewdays later, ahostile king marched upon Benares and
beleaguered it,sending amessage tothekingsummoning him either to
surrender hiskingdom ortodobattle. And theking ofBenares ordered
Bhimasena outtofighthim. SoBhimasena wasarmed ca])-a-pie insoldierly
fashion andmounted onawar-elephant sheathed incomplete armour. And
theBodhisatta, whowasseriously alarmed thatBhimasena might getkilled,
armed himself capa-pie alsoandseated himself modestly behind Bhimasena.
Surrounded byahost, theelephant passed outofthegates ofthecityand
arrived intheforefront ofthebattle. Atthe first notes ofthemartial
drum Bhimasena fella-quaking with fear.•'Ifyou falloffnow, you'll get
killed, "said theBodhisatta, andaccordingly fastened acordround him,which
heheld tight, toprevent himfrom falling offtheeleijhant. Butthesight
ofthefield ofbattle proved toomuch forBhimasena, andthefear ofdeath
wassostrong onhimthathefouled theelephant's back. "Ah," saidthe
Bodhisatta, "thepresent doesnottally with thepast. Then youaffected
thewarrior;nowyourprowess isconfined tobefouling theelephant you
rideon."And sosaying, heuttered thisstanza:—
[359]Youvaunted your prowess, andloudwasyour boast;
Youswore youwould vanquish thefoe!
But isitconsistent, when faced with their host.
Toventyour emotion, sir,so?
When theBodhisatta hadended these taunts, hesaid, "Butdon'tyou
beafraid, myfriend.AmnotIhere toprotect you 1"Then hemade
Bhimasena get ofl'theelephant andbadehimwash himself andgohome.
"And now towinrenown thisday," said theBodhisatta, raising his

battle-cry ashedaslied iuto the fight. Breaking through theking's
camp, hedragged theking outandtookhim alive toBenares. Ingreat
joyathisprowess, hisroyal master loaded himwith honours, andfrom
thatdayforward allIndia wasloud with thefame oftheSage Little
Bowman. ToBhTmasena hegave lai'gesse, andsenthimback tohisown
home ;whilst heliimself excelled incharity and allgood works, andat
hisdeath passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
"Thus, Brethren," said theMaster, "this isnotthe firsttime that this
Brother hasbeen abraggart ;hewasjustthesame inbygone days too." His
lesson ended, theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth by
saying, "This braggart Brother wastheBhTmasena ofthose days, and Imyself

SURAPANA-JATAKA.
[360]"Wedranl:"—Th\H story was toldbytheMaster about theElder
Sagata, while hewasdwelling intheGhosita-park nearKosambl.
For, afterspending therainy season attSavatthi, theMaster hadcome onan
alms-pilgrimage toamarket-town named Bhaddavatika, where cowherds and
goatherds andfarmers andwayfarers i-espectfully besought himnottogodown
totheMango Ferry; "for," said they, "intheMango Ferry, inthedemesne of
thenaked ascetics, dwells apoisonous anddeadly Naga,known astheNaga of
theMango Ferry, whomight harm theBlessed One." Feigning nottohear
them, though they repeated their warning thrice, theBlessed Oneheldonhis
way. Whilst theBlessed Onewasdwelling nearBhaddavatika inacertain
grove there, theElder Sagata, aservant oftheBuddha, whohadwonsuch
supernatural powei's asaworldling canpossess, went tothedemesne, i)iled a
couch ofleaves atthespotwhere theNaga-king dwelt, andsatehimself down
cross-legged thereon. Being unable toconceal hisevilnature, theNaga raised
agreat smoke. SodidtheElder. Then theNaga sent forth flames. Sotoo
didtheElder. But, whilst theNaga's flames didnoharm totheElder, the
Elder's flames diddoharm totheNaga, andsoinashort timehemastered the
Naga-king andestablished him intheRefuges andtheCommandments, after
which herepaired back tothe ]\Iaster. And theMaster, after dwelling aslong
asitpleased himatBhaddavatika, went ontoKosambl. Now thestory ofthe
Naga's conversion bySagata, hadgotnoised abroad allover thecountryside,
andthetownsfolk ofKosambl went forth tomeet theBlessed Oneandsaluted
him, afterwhich theypassed totheElder Sagata andsaluting him, said, "Tell
us, sir,what you lackandwewillfurnish it."TheElder himself remained


No. 81. 207
silent; butthefollowers oftheWicked Six*made answer asfollows:—"Sirs, to
those whohave renounced theworld, white spirits areasrare asthey are
acceptable. Doyouthink youcould gettheElder some clear white spirit?"
"To besurewecan," saidthetownsfolk, andinvited theMaster totake his
meal withthem next day. Then theywent back totheirowntown and
arranged that each inhisownhouse should offer clear white spirit tothe
Elder, andaccordingly they alllaid inastore and invited theElder inand
pliedhimwith theliquor, house byhouse. Sodeep were hispotations that,
onhiswayoutoftown, theElder fellj)rostrate inthegateway andthere lay
hiccoughing nonsense. Onhiswayback from hismeal inthetown, theMaster
came ontheElder lying inthis state, andbidding theBrethren carry Sagata
home, [361] passed onhisway tothe pai'k. TheBrethren laidtheElderdown
with hishead attheBuddha's feet,butheturned round sothathecame tolie
with hisfeettowards tlieBuddha. Then theMaster asked hisquestion,
"Brethren, doesSagata show that respect towards menowthatheformerly did?"
"No, sir." "Tell me.Brethren, who itwasthatmastered theNaga-king ofthe
Mango Feriiy?" "ItwasSagata, sir." "Think youthat inhispresent state
Sagata could master even aharmless water-snake?" "That hecould not, sir."
"Well now. Brethren, isitproper todrink thatwhich, when drunk, steals away
aman's senses?" "It isimproper, sir." Now, after discoursing with the
Brethren indispraise oftheElder, theBlessed One laid itdown asaprecept
thatthedrinking ofintoxicants wasanoffence re(iuiring confession andabsolu-
tion;afterwhich heroseupandpassed into hisperfumed chamber.
Assembling together intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren discussed thesinof
spirit-drinking, saying, "What agreat sin isthedrinking ofspirits, sirs,seeing
that ithasblinded totheBuddha's excellence even onesowiseand sogifted
asSagata." Entering theHall ofTruth atthis i)oint, theMaster asked what
topic theywere discussing;andthey toldhim. "Brethren," said he,"this isnot
the firsttime thattheywhohadrenounced theworld have lost their senses
through drinking sijirits;theverysame thing took place inbygone days."
And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahniadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoanortliern brahmin-family inKasi ;andwhen
hegrew up,herenounced tlioworld for tlie lieiinit's life.Hewonth^
Higher Knowledges and tlieAttainments, anddwelt inthe enjoy-
ment ofthe bliss ofInsight intheHimalayas, with fivehundred pupils
around him. Once,when therainy season hadcome, hispupils said to
him, "Master, maywegotothehaunts ofmenandbring back salt
andvinegar?" "Formyown part, .sirs, Ishall remain here; butyou
may goforyour health's sake, andcome backwhen therainy season
isover."
"V'ery good," saidthey, andtaking arespectful leave oftheir master,
came toBenares, where theytookuptheir abode intheroyal pleasaunce.
Onthemorrow theywent inquest ofalms toavillage just outside the
city gates, where tlieyhadplenty toeat ;andnextdaytheymade their
wayintothecity itself. Thekindly citizens gave-alms tothem, andthe
kingwassooninformed that fivehundred hermits from theHimalayas had

208 Tlie Jcltaka. Book I.
taken uptheirabode iutheroyal pleasaunce, andthattheywere ascetics
ofgreat austerity, subduing the flesh,andofgreat virtue. Hearing this
good character ofthem, thekingwent tothepleasaunce andgraciously
made themwelcome [362] tostaythere forfourmonths. They promised
thattheywould, andthenceforth were fedintheroyal palace andlodged in
tliepleasaunce. Butonedayadrinking festival washeld inthecity,and
thekinggave thefivehundred hermits alarge supply ofthebest spirits,
knowing thatsuch things rarely come intheway ofthosewhorenounce
theworld and itsvanities. The ascetics drank theliquor andwentback
tothepleasaunce. There, indrunken hilarity, some danced, some sang,
whilst others, wearied ofdancing andsinging, kicked about their rice-ham-
persandother belongings,—after which they laydown tosleep. When
tlieyhad slept offtheirdrunkenness andawoke toseethetraces oftheir
revelry, theyweptandlamented, saying, "Wehavedone thatwhich we
ought nottohave done.Wehave done this evilbecause weareaway
from ourmaster." Forthwith, they quitted thepleasaunce andreturned
totheHimalayas. Laying aside their bowls andother belongings, they
saluted their master andtook their seats. "Well,mysons," said he,
"were youcomfortable amid thehaunts ofmen, andwere youspared
weary journey ings inquest ofalms? Didyoudwell inunity onewith
another?"
"Yes, master, wewere comfortable; butwedrank forbidden drink, so
that, losing our senses and forgetting ourselves, weboth danced and
sang." And byway ofsetting thematter forth, theycomposed and
repeated thisstanza :—
Wedrank, wedanced, wesang,wewept ;'twas well
That, whenwedrank thedrink that steals away
The senses, wewere nottransformed toapes.

"Lord Treasurer, don't letthissortofthing gooninyour house. It'senough to
scare anogre tohearsuch ill-omened observations as—
'Stand up,Curse,' or
'Sitdown, Curse,' or'Have your dinner, Curse.' Theman isnotyour social

aman,andthewisedonotmeasure amanbyhisname ;nor isitproper towax
superstitious about mere sounds. Never will Ithrow over, forhismere name's
