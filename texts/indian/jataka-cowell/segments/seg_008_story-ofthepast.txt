won theFiveKnowledges and tlieEight Attainments, anddwelt inthe
Himalayas, where fivehundred hermits gathei'ed round him. Onerainy
season, hischief disciple went with halfthehermits tothehaunts ofmen
toget saltand vinegar. And thatwasthetimewhen theBodhisatta
should die.And hisdisciples, wishing toknow hisspiritual attainment,
said tohim, "What excellence haveyouwonl"
"Won?" saidhe;"1havewon Notliiyiy^." Sosaying, hedied, butwas
reborn intheBrahma Realm ofRadiant Devas. (For Bodhisattas even
though theymayhave attained tothehighest state arenever reborn in
theFormless World, because theyareincapable ofpassing beyond theRealm
ofForm.) Mistaking hismeaning, hisdisciples concluded thathehad
failed towinanyspiritual attainment. Sothey didnotpaythecustomary
honours atcremation.
Onhisreturn thechief disciple learnt that themaster wasdead, and
asked whether theyhadasked what hehadwon. "He saidhehadwon
nothing," said they. "Sowedidnotpayhim theusual honours at
cremation."
"You understood not hismeaning," said that chief disciple. "Our
master meant thathehadattained totheinsight called theinsight into
theNothingness ofThings." Butthough heexplained thisagain and
again tothedisciples, they believed him not.
Knowing their unbelief, theBodhisatta cried, "Fools !they donot
believe mychief disciple. Iwillmake thisthing plain unto them." And
hecame from theBrahma Realm andbyvirtue ofhismighty powers
rested inmid-air above thehermitage anduttered thisstanza inpraise of
thewisdom ofthechief disciple:—[407]
Farbetter than athousand fools, though they
Cryoutahundred years unceasingly,
Isonewho, hearing, straightway understands.
Thus didtheGreat Being from mid-air proclaim theTruth andrebuke
theband ofhermits. Then hepassed back totheBrahma Realm, and
allthose hermits tooqualified themselves forrebirth inthesame Realm.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Sariputta was
thechief disciple ofthose days,and IMaha-Brahma."
1One ofthehighest Attainments wastheinsight intothenothingness ofthings;

"/;i guise ofjoy."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atKunda-
dhanavana near thecity ofKundiya about Suppavasix, alay-sister, whowas
daughter toKing Koliya. For atthat time, she,whohad carried achild
seven years inherwomb, was intheseventh day ofherthroes, andher
pains were grievous. Inspite ofallheragony, shethought asfollows:—"All-
Enlightened istheBlessed Onewhopreaches theTruth totheendthatsuch
suffering may cease; righteous aretheElect oftheBlessed Onewho sowalk
thatsuch suffering may cease; blessed isNirvana wherein such suffering doth
cease." These three thoughts were herconsolation inherpangs. And she
sentherhusband totheBuddha totellherstateandbearagreeting forher.
Hermessage wasgiven totheBlessed One,who said, [408]"May Suppavasa,
daughter oftheking oftheKoliyas, grow strong and well again, andbear a
healthy child." And attheword oftheBlessed One, Suppavasa, daughter of
theking oftheKoliyas, became welland strong, andbore ahealtliy child.
Finding onhisreturn tliat hiswifehadbeen safely delivered, thehusband
marvelled greatly attheexalted powers oftheBuddha. Now that herchild
wasborn, Suppavasa waseager toshew bounty forseven days totheBrother-
hood with theBuddha atitshead, andsent herhusband back toinvite them.
Now itchanced that atthattime theBrotherhood with theBuddha atitshead
hadreceived aninvitation from thelayman whosupported theElder Moggallana
theGreat; buttheMaster, wishing togratify Suppavasa's charitable desires,
sent totheElder toexplain thematter, andwith theBrotherhood accepted
forseven days thehospitality ofSuppavasa. Ontheseventh dayshedressed
upher little boy,whose name was Sivali, andmadehimbowbefore theBuddha
andtheBrotherhood. Andwhen hewasbrought induecourse toSariputta,
theElder inallkindness greeted theinfant, saying, "Well, Sivali, isallwell
withyou?" "How could itbe,sir?" saidtheinfant. "Seven long years have
Ihadtowallow inblood."
Then injoySuppavasa exclaimed, "My child, onlyseven days old, isactually
discoursing onreligion with theapostle Sariputta, theCaptain oftheFaith!"
"Would you likeanother such achild?" asked theMaster. "Yes, sir;"
saidSuppavasa, "seven more, ifIcould havethem likehim." Insolemn phrase
theMaster gavethanks forSuppavasfi's hospitality anddeparted.
Atseven years ofagethechild Sivali gave hisheart totheFaith and
forsook theworld tojoin theBrotherhood ;attwenty hewasadmitted afull
Brother. Righteous washeandwon thecrown ofrighteousness which is
Arahatship, andtheearth shouted aloud forjoy.
Soonedaytheassembled Brethren talked with oneanother intheHall
ofTruth respecting thematter, saying, "TheElder Sivali, who isnowsoshining
alight, wasthechild ofmany prayers ;seven long years washeinthewomb
andseven days inbirth. How greatmust have been thepains ofmother and
child !Ofwhat deeds were their pains thefruit?"
Entering thehall,theMaster asked thesubject oftheir discourse. "Brethren,"
said he,"the righteous Sivali [409]wasseven years inthewomb andseven days
inbirth allbecause ofhisownpast deeds. And similarly Suppavasa's seven
years' pregnancy andseven days' travail resulted from herownpast deeds."
Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattawasthechild ofthequeen consort, andgrewupandwaseducated at
Takkasila, and athisfather's death became kingandruled righteously.
Now inthose days theKing ofKosala cameupwith agreat force against
Benares andslew thekingandbore offhisqueen tobehisown wife.
When thekingwas slain, hissonmade hisescape through thesewer.
Afterwards hecollected amighty forceandcame toBenares. Encamping
hard by,hesentamessage totheking toeither surrender thekingdom
orgive battle. And theking sentback theanswer thathewotild give
battle. But themother oftheyoung prince, hearing ofthis, sent a
message toherson, saying, "There isnoneed todobattle. Letevery
a})proach tothecityonevery sidebeinvested andbarred, tilllack of
firewood andwater andfood wears outthepeople. Then thecity will
fallintoyourhands without anyfighting." Following hismother's advice,
theprince forseven days invested thecitywith soclose ablockade that
thecitizens ontheseventh daycutofftheir king's headandbrought itto
theprince. Then heentered thecityandmade himself king, andwhen
hislifeended hepas<sed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
The result andconsequence ofhisacts inblockading thecity forthose seven
dayswasthat forseven years heabode inthewomb andwasseven days in
birth. But,inasmuch ashehad fallen atthefeetoftheBuddha Padumuttara
andhad [)rayed withmany gifts that thecrown ofArahatship might behis;
and,inasmuch as,inthedays oftheBuddha Vipassi, hehad ofFei'ed upthe
same prayer, heandhistownsfolk, with gifts ofgreat price;—[410] therefore, by
hismerit, hewontheci'own ofArahatship. Andbecause Suppaviisa sent the
message bidding hersontake thecitybyblockade, shewasdoomed toaseven
years' pregnancy andtoaseven days' travail.
Hisstory ended, theMaster, asBuddha, repeated these verses:—
Inguise ofjoyand blessings, sorrow comes
And trouble, sluggai'ds' hearts tooverwhelm.
Andwhen hehadtaught this lesson, theMaster identified theBirth by
saying, "Sivali wastheprince who inthose days blockaded the city,and
became king ;Suppavasa washismother, and Ihisfather, theking ofBenares."
