Once onatime atthefootofacertain mountain there were living

Now onedayadispute arose between thetwofriends about thecold.
The tiger said itwas cold inthedark half ofthemonth, whilst thelion
maintained that itwas cold inthe light half. Asthetwo ofthem

repeated thisstanza :—

And, therefore, Idecide youboth areright.
Thus didtheBodhisatta make peace between those friends.

"IffolkImtkneiv."—'Vh.m story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about Feasts fortheDead. For atthistime thefolkwere jiutting todeath
goats, sheep, andother animals, and offering themupaswhat iscalled aFeast
fortheDead, forthesake oftheir departed kinsmen. Finding them thus
engaged, theBrethren asked theMaster, saying, "Just now, sir,thefolk are
taking thelives ofmany living creatures and oftering themupaswhat iscalled
aFeast fortheDead. Can itbe,sir,thatthere isanygood inthis?"
"No,Brethren," replied theMaster ;"notevenwhen lifeistaken with the
object ofproviding aFeast fortheDead, diiesanygood arise therefrom. In
bygone days thewise, preaching theTruth from mid-air, andshewing the evil
consequences ofthepractice, made thewhole continent renounce it.Butnow,
when their previous existences havebecome confused intheir minds, thepractice
hassprung upafresh." And, sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, abrahmin,
whowasversed intheThree Vedas andworld-famed asateacher, being
minded tooffer aFeast fortheDead, hadagoat fetched andsaid tohis

pupils, "Mysons, take thisgoat clown totheriverandbathe it ;then
hang agarland round itsneck, give itapottle ofgrain toeat,groom ita
bit,andbring itback."
"Very good," said they, anddown totheriver they took thegoat,
where they bathed andgroomed thecreature and set itonthebank.
Thegoat,becoming conscious ofthedeeds ofitspast lives, wasoverjoyed
atthethought thatonthisveryday itwould befreed from allitsmisery,
andlaughed aloud likethesmashing ofapot.Then atthethought that
thebrahmin byslaying itwould bear themisery which ithadborne, the
goat feltagreat compassion forthebrahmin, andwept with aloud voice.
"Friend goat," saidtheyoung brahmins [167], "your voice hasbeen loud
both inlaughter and inweeping ;whatmade youlaugh andwhatmade
youweep 1"
"Askmeyour question before your master."
Sowith thegoattheycame totheir master andtoldhim ofthematter.
After hearing their story, themaster asked thegoatwhy itlaughed and
why itwept. Hereupon theanimal, recalling itspastdeeds byitspower
ofremembering itsformer existences, spoke thus tothebrahmin:—"In
times past,brahmin, I,likeyou,wasabrahmin versed inthemystic texts
oftheVedas, and I,tooffer aFeast fortheDead, killed agoat formy
offering. Allthrough killing that single goat, Ihavehadmyhead cutoff
fivehundred times allbutone. This ismyfivehundredth and lastbirth;
and Ilaughed aloud when Ithought that thisverydayIshould befreed
frommymisery. Ontheother hand, Iweptwhen Ithought how, whilst
T,who forkilling agoathadbeendoomed tolosemyhead fivehundred
times, was to-day being freed frommymisery, you, asapenalty for
killing me,would bedoomed toloseyour head, likeme, fivehundred
times. Thus itwasoutofcompassion foryouthat Iwept." "Fear not,
goat," saidthebrahmin ;"Iwillnot killyou." "What isthisyou say,
brahmin?"saidthegoat. "Whether you killmeornot, Icannot escape
death to-day." "Fear not,goat; Iwillgoabout withyoutoguard you."
"Weak isyour protection, brahmin, and strong istheforce ofmy
evil-doing."
Setting thegoat atliberty, thebrahmin saidtohisdisciples, "Letus
notallow anyone tokillthisgoat;" and,accompanied bytheyoung men,
hefollowed theanimal closely about. Themoment thegoatwas setfree,
itreached out itsneck tobrowse ontheleaves ofabushgrowing near
thetopofarock. And thatvery instant athunderbolt struck therock,
rending offamasswhich hitthegoatontheoutstretched neckandtore
offitshead. And people came crowding round.

these creatures onlyknew the fruit ofevil-doing, perhaps theywould
desist from killing,' inhissweet voice hetaught them theTruth inthis
stanza :—
Iffolkbutknew thepenalty would be
Birth unto sorrow, living things would cease
From taking life. Stern istheslayer's doom.
Thus didtheGreat Being preach theTruth, scaring hishearers with
thefear ofhell; and the people, hearing him, were soterrified at
thefearofhellthatthey left ofi"taking life.And theBodhisatta after
establishing themultitude intheCommandments bypreaching theTruth
tothem, passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts. The people, too,
remained steadfast intheteaching oftheBodhisatta andspent their lives
incharity andother good works, sothat intheendtheythronged theCity

slay living creatures and ofterthem asasacrifice togods,andsetoutontheir

When theBrethi^en became aware ofthis,theyasked theBlessed One, saying,
"Can there beanygood inthis, sir/"

ButtheTree-Fairy, standing inthefork ofitstree,repeated thisstanza:—
Take thought oflifehereafter when youseek
'Release'; forthis release isbondage strict.
Notthus thewiseandgood release themselves;
For this, the fool's release, inbondage ends.
Thenceforth, men refrained from suchtaking oflife,andbywalking in

[170]^^Ifound thefootprints." This story was toldbytheMaster whilst
journeying onanalms-pilgrimage through Kosala, when hehadcome tothe
village ofNalaka-jmna (Cane-drink) andwasdwelling atKetaka-vana nearthe
Pool ofNalaka-pana, about cane-sticks. Inthose days theBrethren, after
bathing inthePool ofNalaka-pana, made thenovices getthem cane-sticks for
needle-cases \but,tincbng them hollow throughout, went totheMaster and said,
"Sir,wehadcane-sticks gotinorder topi'ovide needle-cases;andfrom topto
bottom they arequite hollow. Nowhowcanthatbe?"
"Bretln-en," saidtheMaster, "such wasmyordinance intimes gone by."
And, sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
h\past times, wearetold, there wasathick forest onthis spot. And
inthelakeheredwelt awater-ogre whoused todevour everyone whowent
down intothewater. Inthose days theBodhisatta hadcome tolifeasthe
king ofthemonkeys, andwasasbigasthefawn ofareddeer ;helived in
that forest atthehead ofatroop ofnolessthan eighty thousand monkeys

whom heshielded from harm. Thus didhecounsel hissiibjects :—"My
friends, inthis forest there aretrees thatarepoisonous andlakes thatare
haunted byogres. Mind toaskme first before you either eatany fruit
which youhave noteaten before, ordrink ofanywater where youhave
notdrunk before." "Certainly," saidthey readily.
Onedaytheycame toaspottheyhadnever visited before. Asthey
were searching forwater todrink after their day's wanderings, theycame
onthis lake. Butthey didnotdrink;onthecontrary they satdown
watching forthecoming oftheBodhisatta.
When hecame up,hesaid, "Well,myfriends, why don'tyoudrink 1"
"Wewaited foryoutocome."
"Quite right,myfriends/' saidtheBodhisatta. Then hemade acir-
cuit ofthelake,andscrutinized thefootprints round, with theresult that
hefound that allthefootsteps leddown intothewater andnonecame up
again. "Without doubt," thought hetohimself, "this isthehaunt ofan
ogre." Sohesaid tohisfollowers, "You arequite right,myfriends, in
notdrinking ofthis vi^ater ;forthelake ishaunted byanogre."
When thewater-ogre realised thattheywere notentering hisdomain,
[171] heassumed theshape ofahorrible monster with ablue belly, a
white face,andbright- redhands andfeet ;inthisshape hecame outfrom
thewater, and said,"Why areyouseated here'?Godown into thelake
anddrink." ButtheBodhisatta said tohim, "Arenotyoutheogre of
thiswater 1""Yes, Iam,"wastheanswer. "Doyoutake asyourprey
allthosewhogodown into thiswater?" "Yes, Ido;from small birds
upwards, Inever letanything gowhich comes down intomywater. I
willeatthelotofyou too." "Butweshall not letyoueatus," "Just
drink thewater." "Yes,wewilldrink thewater, andyetnot fallinto
your power." "How doyoupropose todrink thewater, then?" "Ah,
youthink weshallhave togodown intothewater todrink;whereas we
shall notenter thewater atall,butthewhole eighty thousand ofuswill
take acaneeachanddrink therewith fromyour lake aseasily aswecould
through thehollow stalk ofalotus. And soyouwillnotbeable toeat
us."And herepeated thelatter half ofthefollowing stanza (the first
halfbeing added bytheMaster when, asBuddha, herecalled the inci-
dent) :—
Ifound thefootprints allleaddown, none back.
With canes we'll drink;you shall nottakemy life.
8osaying, theBodhisatta hadacanebrought tohim. Then, calling to
mind theTenPerfections displayed byhim, herecited them inasolemn
asseveration', andblewdown thecane. [172] Straightway thecanebecame

hollow throughout, without asingle knotbeing leftinallitslength. Inthis
fashion hehadanother andanother brought andblewdown them. (But
ifthiswere so,hecould never have finished;andaccordingly theforego-
ingsentence must notbeunderstood inthis—literal—sense.) Next the
Bodhisatta made thetour ofthelake,andcommanded, saying, "Let all
canes growing herebecome hollow throughout." Now, thanks tothe
great virtues ofthesaving goodness ofBodhisattas, theircommands are
always fulfilled. And thenceforth every single cane thatgrew round tliat
lakebecame hollow throughout.
(InthisKaj)jm, orEra,there arefour miracles which endure through
thewhole Era.What arethefourl Well, they are—first, thesign ofthe
hare inthemoon', which will lastthrough thewhole Era;secondly, the
spotwhere the firewasputoutastold intheVattaka Jataka*, which
shall remain untouched byfirethroughout theEra ;thirdly, onthe site
ofGhatikara's house^ norain shall ever fallwhile thisEra lasts;and
lastly, thecanes thatgrow round thislake shall behollow throughout
during thewhole oftheEra. Such arethefour Era-mii-acles, asthey are
called.)
After giving thiscommand, theBodhisatta seated himself withacane in
hishands. Alltheother eighty thousand monkeys tooseated themselves
round thelake, eachwith acane inhishands. And atthesamemoment
when theBodhisatta sucked thewater upthrough hiscane, they alldrank
toointhesamemanner, asthey satonthebank. Thiswasthewaythey
drank, andnotoneofthem could thewater-ogre get ;sohewent off'ina
rage tohisown habitation. TheBodhisatta, too,with hisfollowing went
back intotheforest.
When theMaster hadended hislesson andhadrei)eated what hehadsaidas
tothehollowness ofthecanes being theresult ofaformer ordinance ofhis
own, heshewed theconnexion, and identified theBirth bysaying, "Devadatta

[173]"Theantelope knoics well"— This storywastoldbytheMaster while at
theBamboo-gi-ove about Devadatta. Foroncewhen theBrethren weregathered
together intheHall ofTruth, they sattalking reproachfully ofDevadatta, saying,
"Sirs,with aview todestroy theBuddha Devadatta hiredbowmen, hurled down
arock,and letloose theelephant Dhana-palaka;ineverywayhegoesabout to
slaytheLord of^^'isdoml." Entering andseating himself ontheseatprepared
forhim, theMaster asked, saying, "Sirs, what isthetheme youarediscussing
here inconclave?" "Sir," wasthereply, "wewere discussing thewickedness of
Devadatta, saying that hewasalways going about toslay you." Said the
Master, "It isnotonly inthese present days, Bretliren, thatDevadatta goes
about seeking toslayme ;hewent about with thelikeintent inbygone days
also,— butwasunable toslayme."And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasanantelope, andused toliveonfruits inhis
haunts intheforest.
Atoneperiod hewas subsisting onthe fruit ofasepamii-tree.
And there wasavillage liunter, whose method was tobuild aplatform
intrees atthefoot ofwhich hefound thetrack ofdeer, and towatch
aloft fortheircoming toeatthefruits ofthetrees. When thedeercame,
hebrought themdown with ajavelin, and soldthe flesh foraliving.
Thishunter onedaymarked thetracks oftheBodhisatta atthefoot ofthe
tree,andmade himself aplatform upintheboughs. Having breakfasted
early, hewent with hisjavelin into theforest andseated himself onhis
platform. TheBodhisatta, too,came abroad early toeatthefruit ofthat
tree ;buthewasnotintoogreat ahurry toapproach it."For," thought
hetohimself, "sometimes these platform-building hunters build themselves
platforms intheboughs. Can itbethat thiscanhave happened here 1"
Andhehalted someway offtoreconnoitre. Finding that theBodhisatta
didnotapproach, thehunter, stillseated aloftonhisplatform, [174] threw
fruitdown infront oftheantelope. Said thelatter tohimself, "Here's
thefruitcoming tomeetme; Iwonder ifthere isahunter upthere."
Sohelooked, andlooked, tillhecaught sight ofthehunter inthetree;
but, feigning nottohave seen theman, heshouted, "My worthy tree,
hitherto youhavebeen inthehabit ofletting your fruit fallstraight to

toomust change, andlook forfoodbeneath another tree." And sosaying,
herepeated thisstanza:—
Theantelope knows wellthefruityoudrop.
Ilike itnot;some other tree I'llseek*.
Then thehunter from hisplatform hurled hisjavelin attheBodhisatta,
crying, "Begone !I'vemissed you this time." Wheeling round, the
Bodhisatta halted and said,'•Youmayhave missed lae^mygoodman;
butdepend upon it,youhave notmissed thereward ofyour conduct,
namely, theeight Large andthesixteen Lesser hellsand alltheliveforms
ofbonds andtorture." With these words theantelope bounded offonits
way ;andthehunter, too,climbed down andwent hisway.
When theMaster hadended thisdiscourse andhadrepeated what hohad
saidabout Devadatta's going about toslayhim inbygone days also,heshewed
theconnexion andidentified theBirth, bysaying, "Devadatta wastheplatform-
hunter ofthose days,and Imyself theantelope."

they leftinthecourtyard, stillhitched ontothechariot. Inthenight
itrained andtheharness gotwet. Moreover, theking's dogscamedown
from theupper chambers andgnawed theleather work andstraps. Next
daythey toldtheking, saying, "Sire, dogshave gotinthrough themouth
ofthesewer andhavegnawed theleather work and straps ofyour
majesty's carriage." Enraged atthedogs, theking said, "Killevery dog
you see." Then began agreat slaughter ofdogs ;andthecreatures,
finding thattheywere being slainwhenever theywere seen, repaired to
thecemetery totheBodhisatta. "What isthemeaning," asked he,"ofyour
assembling insuchnumbers'?" They said,"The king issoenraged atthe
report thattheleather workand straps ofhiscarriage have beengnawed
bydogs within theroyal precincts, that hehasordered alldogs tobe
killed. Dogs arebeing destroyed wholesale, andgreat peril hasarisen."
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "No dogsfrom without canget
intoaplace soclosely watched ;itmust bethethoroughbred dogs inside
thepalace whohavedone it.Ati)resent nothing ha{)pens tothereal
culprits, while theguiltless arebeing put todeath. What ifIwere to
discover theculprits tothekingandsosave thelives ofmykithandkin?"
Hecomforted hiskinsfolk bysaying, "Have nofear ;Iwillsave you.
[176] Only waithere tillIseetheking."
Then, guided bythethoughts oflove,and calling tomind theTen
Perfections, hemade hisway alone andunattended into the city,com-
manding thus,"Let nohand belifted tothrow stick orstone atme."
Accordingly, when hemade hisappearance, notamangrew angry atthe
sight ofhim.
Theking meantime, after ordering thedogs' destruction, hadtaken
hisseatinthehallofjustice. And straight tohimrantheBodhisatta,
leaping under theking's throne. The king's servants tried togethim
out;buthismajesty stojjped them. Taking heart alittle, theBodhisatta
came forth from under thethrone, andbowing totheking, said, "Is
ityouwho arehaving thedogs destroyed?" "Yes, itisI.""What
istheir otfence, king ofmenl" "They have beengnawing thestraps
andtheleather covering mycarriage." "Do youknow thedogswho
actually didthemischief?" "No, Idonot." "But, your majesty, if
youdonotknow forcertain thereal culprits, itisnotright toorder the
destruction ofevery dogthat isseen." "Itwasbecause dogshadgnawed
theleather ofmycarriage that Iordered them alltobekilled." "Do
your people kill alldogs without exception ;orarethere some dogswho
arespared1""Some arespared,—thethorough-bred dogs ofmyown
palace." "Sire, justnowyouwere saying thatyouhadordered the
universal slaughter ofalldogswherever found, because dogshadgnawed
theleather ofyour carriage ;whereas, now,yousaythat thethorough-
breddogs ofyourownpalace escape death. Therefoi-e youarefollowing

courses arewrong, andnotkinglike. Forkings intrying cases should
beasunbiassed asthebeam ofabalance. But inthis instance, since
theroyal dogsgoscot-free, whilst poor dogs arekilled, this isnotthe
impartial doom ofalldogs alike, butonly theslaughter ofpoor dogs."
Andmoreover, theGreat Being, lifting uphissweet voice, said, "Sire, it
isnotjustice thatyouareperforming," andhetaught theTruth tothe
king inthisstanza:—[177]
Tliedogs that intheroyal palace grow.
Thewell-bred dogs, sostrong and fairoffoi'm,—
Not these, butonly we,aredoomed todie.
Here's noimpartial sentence meted out
Toallalike ;'tisslaughter ofthepoor.
After listening totheBodhisatta's words, theking said, "Doyou in
yourwisdom knowwho itactually wasthatgnawed theleather ofmy
carriage]" "Yes, sire.""Who wasit?" "The thorough-bred dogs
that liveinyourown palace." "How can itbeshewn that itwasthey
whognawed theleather?" "Iwillprove ittoyou," "Do so,sage."
"Then send foryour dogs,andhave alittle butter-milk andkusa-grass
brought in."Theking did so.
Then saidtheGreat Being, "Letthisgrass bemashed upinthebutter-
milk, andmake thedogsdrink it."
Theking didso;—with theresult thateach several dog, ashedrank,
vomited. And they allbrought upbits ofleather !"Why itislikea
judgment ofaPerfect Buddha himself," cried theking overjoyed, and
hedidhomage totheBodhisatta byoflfering himtheroyal umbrella. But
theBodhisatta taught theTruth inthetenstanzas onrighteousness inthe
Te-sakuna Jataka^, beginning with thewords :—
Walk righteously, great king ofprincely race.
Then having established theking intheFiveCommandments, and
having exhorted hismajesty tobesteadfast, theBodhisatta handed back to
theking thewhite umbrella ofkingship.
Attheclose oftheGreat Being's words, [178] thekingcommanded
thatthelives ofallcreatures should besafefromharm. Heoi-dered that
alldogsfrom theBodhisatta downwards, should have aconstant supply of
foodsuch ashehimself ate; and, abiding bytheteachings oftheBodhi-
satta, hespent hislifelong incharity andother good deeds, sothatwhen

"Though prostrate jiow."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at

theMaster addressed thatBrother and said, "Brethren, inbygone days thewise
andgood persevered evenamid hostile surroundings, and,evenwhen theywere
woimded, stilldidnotgive in."And, sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattacame tolifeasathoroughbred Sindh horse andwasmade theking's
destrier, surrounded byallpomp and state. Hewasfedonexquisite
three-year oldrice,which wasalways served uptohim inagolden dish
worth ahundred thousand pieces ofmoney ;andtheground ofhisstall
was[lerfumed with thefour odours. Round hisstallwerehung crimson
curtains, while overhead wasacanopy studded with stars ofgold. Onthe
walls were festooned wreaths andgarlands offragrant flowers; andalamp
fedwith scented oilwasalways burning thez'e.
Now allthekings round coveted thekingdom ofBenares. Once seven
kings encompassed Benares, andsentamissive totheking, saying, "Either
yield upyourkingdom tousorgive battle." Assembling hisministers,
theking ofBenares laidthematter before them, andasked them what he
wastodo. Said they, "Youought nottogoouttodobattle inperson,
sire, inthe first instance. [179] Despatch suchandsuch aknight out first
tofightthem;andlater on,ifhefails,wewilldecide what todo."
Then theking sent forthatknight andsaid tohim,"Can youfight the
seven kings,mydearknight? "Said he,"Give mebutyour noble destrier,
andthen Icould fight notseven kings only, but allthekings inIndia."
"Mydear knight, takemydestrier oranyother horse youplease, anddo
battle." "Very good,mysovereign lord," saidtheknight; andwith abow
hepassed down from theupper chambers ofthepalace. Then hehadthe
noble destrier ledoutandsheathed inmail,arming himself toocnp-a-yiie.

andgirding onhissword. Mounted onhisnoble steed hepassed outofthe
city-gate, andwith alightning charge broke down the firstcamp, taking
oneking alive andbringing himback aprisoner tothesoldiers' custody.
Returning tothe field, hebroke down thesecond andthethird camps,
and soonuntil hecaptured alive five kings. The sixthcamp hehad
justbroken down, andhadcaptured thesixth king,when hisdestrier
received awound, which streamed with blood andcaused thenoble animal
sharp pain. Perceiving thatthehorse waswounded, theknight made it
liedown attheking's gate, loosened itsmail,and setabout arming another
horse. AstheBodhisatta layatfulllength onhisside,heopened hiseyes,
andgathered what theknight was doing. "My rider," thought heto
himself, "isarming another horse. That other horse willnever beable to
break down theseventh camp andcapture theseventh king ;hewilllose
allthat Ihave accomplished. This peerless knight willbeslain;andthe
king, too,will fallintothehands ofthefoe. Ialone, andnoother horse,
canbreakdown thatseventh camp andcapture theseventh king." So,as
helaythere, hecalled totheknight, and said, "Sir knight, there isno
horse butIwhocanbreak down theseventh camp and capture the
seventh king. Iwillnotthrow away what Ihave already done;only

herepeated thisstanza:—[180]

Yet stillnohack canmatch thedestrier.

Theknight hadtheBodhisatta setupon his feet,bound uphiswound,
andarmed himagain inproof. Mounted onthedestrier, hebroke down
theseventh camp, andbrought back alive theseventh king,whom he

exhorted theking, theytook offhismail;butwhen theywere taking it
offpiecemeal, hepassed away.

"Change thou thespot."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about anex-goldsmith, whohadbecome aBrother andwasco-resident withthe
Captain oftheFaith (Sariputta).
Now, itisonly aBuddha whohasknowledge ofthehearts andcanread
thethoughts ofmen; andtherefore through lack ofthispower, theCaptain
oftheFaith hadsolittleknowledge oftheheart andthoughts ofhisco-resident,
astoprescribe impurity asthetheme formeditation. This wasnogood
tothat Brother. Thereason why itwasnogood tohimwas that, according
totradition, hehadinvariably been born, throughout fivehundred successive
births, asagoldsmith; and, consequently, thecumulative effect ofseeing
absolutely pure gold forsolongatimehadmade thetheme ofimpurity useless.
Hespent fourmonths without being able togetsomuch asthe first inkling
ofthe idea. Finding himself unable toconfer Arahatship onhisco-resident,
theCaptain oftheFaith thought tohimself, "This must certainly beonewhom
none butaBuddha canconvert ;Iwilltakehim totheBuddha." Soat
earlydawn hecame with theBrother totheMaster.
"What can itbe,Sariputta," saidtheMaster, "that hasbrought youhere
with thisBrother?" "Sir, Igavehimatheme formeditation, and after four
months hehasnotattained tosomuch asthe first inkling oftheidea; so
Ibrought himtoyou,thinking thatherewasonewhom none butaBuddha can
convert." "What meditation, Sariputta, didyou prescribe forhim?" "The
meditation onimpurity. Blessed One." "Sariputta, itisnotyours tohave
knowledge ofthehearts andtoread thethoughts ofmen. Depart now alone,
andintheevening come back tofetch your co-resident."
After thusdismissing theElder, theMaster hadthatBrother clad inanice
under-cloth andarobe, kepthim constantly athissidewhen hewent into
town foralms, andsawthathereceived choice food ofallkinds. Returning to
theMonastery oncemore, surrounded bytheBrethren, theMaster retired during
thedaytime [183] tohisperfumed chamber, andatevening, ashewalked about
theMonastery with thatBrother byhisside, hemade apond appear andinit
agreat clump oflotuses outofwhich grew agreat lotus-flower. "Sit here,
Brother," hesaid,"andgaze atthis flower." And, leaving theBrother seated
thus, heretired tohisperfumed chamber.
That Brother gazed andgazed atthat flower. The Blessed Onemade it
decay. AstheBrother looked atit,theflower initsdocay farled; thepetals


No. 25. 65
fell off,beginning attherim, tillinalittle while allwere gone; then the
stamens fellaway, andonly thepericarp was left.Ashelooked, thatBrother
thought within himself, "Even now, thislotus-flower waslovely and fair; yetits
colour isdeparted, itspetals andstamens have fallen away, andonly the
pericarp isleftstanding. Decay hasc(mieupon this beautiful lotus; whatmay
notbefallmybody? Transitory are allcompounded things!" And with the
thought hewon Insight.
Knowing thattheBrother's mind had I'isen toInsight, theblaster, seated as
hewas inhisperfumed chamber, emitted aradiant semblance ofhimself,
anduttered thisstanza:—
Pluck out self-love, aswith thehand youpluck
Theautumn water-lily. Setyour heart
Onnaught but this, theperfect Path ofPeace,
And that Extinction which theBuddha taught.
Attheclose ofthisstanza, thatBrother wonArahatship. Atthethought
thathewould never beborn again, never betroul)led with existence inany
shajje hereafter, heliurst into aheartfelt utterance beginning with these
stanzas :—
Hewhohaslived his life,whose thought isripe;
Hewho,from alldefilements purged and free.
Wears hislastbody; hewhose life ispure.
Whose subject senses ownhimsovereign lord;—
He, likethemoon thatwins herway atlast
From Rahu's jaws^, haswonsupreme release.
The foulness which enveloped me,which wrought
Delusion's utter darkness, Idispelled
;—As,tricked withthousand rays, thebeaming sun
Illumines heaven with aflood oflight.
After thisandrenewed utterances ofjoy,hewent totheBlessed Oneand
saluted him. TheElder, too,came, andafterduesalutation totheMaster, went
away with hisco-resident.
When news ofallthisspread among theBrethren, [184] they gathered
together intheHall ofTruth andthere satpraising thevirtues oftheLord
ofWisdom, andsaying, "Sirs, through notknowing thehearts andthoughts
ofmen, theElder Sariputta wasignorant ofhisco-resident's disposition. But
theMaster knew, and inasingle daybestowed onhimArahatship together
with perfected scholarship. Oh,how great arethemarvellous powers ofa
Buddha!"
Entering andtaking theseat setready forhim, theMaster asked, saying,
"What isthetheme ofyour discourse here inconclave, Brethren?"
"Naught else.Blessed One,than this,—thatyoualone hadknowledge ofthe
heart, andcould read thethoughts, oftheco-resident oftheCaptain ofthe
Faith."
"This isnomarvel. Brethren; that I,asBuddha, should nowknow that
Brother's disposition. Even inbygone days Iknew itequally well." And, so
saying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.

self-love that hasbeen offended sodeeply that hewill notgointo the

Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured theadherence ofPrince
Ajata-sattu, hadattained both gainandhonour. Prince Ajata-sattu hada
Monastery built forDevadatta atGaya-sisa, andevery daybrought tohim[186]
fivehundred kettles ofperfumed three-year-old riceflavoured with allthechoicest
flavourings. Allthisgainandhonour brought Devadatta agreat following,
withwhom Devadatta lived on,without ever stirring outofhisMonastery.
Atthat time there were living inRajagaha two friends, ofwhom one
hadtaken thevows iinder theMaster, whilst theother hadtaken them under
Devadatta. And these continued toseeoneanother, either casually orby
visiting theMonasteries. Nowonedaythedisciple ofDevadatta saidtotheother,
"Sir,whydoyoudaily goround foralms with thesweat streaming oft'you?

tinghowever toreturn totheBamboo-grove attheprojjer hour. Nevertheless
hecould notkeep itsecret always;and inalittle while itcame outthat
heused tohie oft'toGaya-sisa andthere regale himself with thefoodprovided
forDevadatta. Accordingly, hisfriends asked him, saying. "Isittrue, asthey
say,thatyouregale yourself onthefoodprovided forDevadatta?" "Who said
that?" said he."So-and-so said it." "It istrue, sirs,that IgotoGaya-sisa

Come; letusbring you before theMaster." And, taking withthem the
Brother, theywent totheHall ofTruth.
When theMaster became aware oftheir presence, hesaid, "Brethren, areyou

68 TheJ(Itaha. Booh I.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta became hisminister. Inthose days thekinghadastate-
elephant [187], named Damsel-face, whowasvirtuous andgood, andnever
hurt anybody.
Now onedaysome burglars came closeuptotheelephant's stallby
night and satdown todiscuss their plans inthese words:—"This isthe
way totunnel into ahouse;this isthewaytobreak inthrough thewalls;
befoi-e carrying offtheplunder, thetunnel orbreach inthewalls ought
tobemade asclearandopen asaroad oraford. Inlifting thegoods,
youshouldn't stick atmurder; forthus there willbenone able toresist.
Aburglar should getridofallgoodness and virtue, andbequite pitiless,
aman ofcruelty and violence." After having schooled oneanother in
these counsels, theburglars took themselves off.Thenextdaytoothey
came, andmany other days besides, andheld likeconverse together, till
theelephant came totheconclusion thattheycame expressly toinstruct
him,andthathemust turn pitiless, cruel, andviolent. Andsuchindeed
hebecame. Nosooner didhismahout appear intheearly morning than
theelephant took theman inhistrunk anddashed him todeath onthe
ground. And inthesamewayhetreated asecond, andathird, andevery
person inturnwhocame near him.
Thenewswasbrought totheking thatDamsel-face hadgonemadand
was killing everybody thathecaught sight of.Sotheking sent the
Bodhisatta, saying, "Go, sage,andfindoutwhat hasperverted him."
Away went the Bodhisatta, and soon satisfied himself that the
elephant showed nosigns ofbodily ailment. Ashethought over the
possible causes ofthechange, hecame totheconclusion thattheelephant
mu.st have heard persons talking near him,andhave imagined thatthey
were giving him alesson, and that thiswaswhat hadperverted the
animal. Accordingly, heasked theelephant-keepers whether anypersons
hadbeen talking together recently near the stallbynight. "Yes,my
lord," was theanswer ;"some burglars came and talked." Then the
Bodhisatta wentandtoldtheking, saying, "There isnothing wrong, sire,
with theelephant bodily ;hehasbeen perverted byoverhearing some
burglars talk." "Well, what istobedonenowV "Order good men,
sages andbrahmins, tositinhisstalland totalk ofgoodness." "Doso,
myfriend," saidtheking. Then theBodhisatta setgoodmen, sagesand
bi'ahmins, inthestall [188], andbadethem talk ofgoodness. And they,
taking their seats hardbytheelephant, spoke asfollows, "Neither mal-
treat nor kill. Thegood should belong-suffering, loving, andmerciful."
Hearing thistheelephant thought theymustmean this asalesson for
him,andresolved thenceforth tobecome good. Andgoodhebecame.
"Well, myfriend," .said theking totheBodhisatta; "ishegood
now?" "Yes, your majesty," saidtheBodhisatta; "thanks towiseand

And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Through hearing firsttheburglars' wicked talk

Through hearing, later, wisemen's lofty woixls
Thenoble elephant turned good once more.
Said theking,"He canread themind even ofananimal!" Andhe
conferi-ed great honour ontheBodhisatta. After living toagood old
age, ho,with tlieBodhisatta, passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Said theMiister,—"Inthepast, too,youfollowed everyone youmet,Brother;

"jVomorsel can heeat."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about alay-disciple andanaged Elder. [189]
Tradition says that there were inSavatthi two friends, ofwhom onejoined
theBrotherhood butused togoe\'ery day totheother's house, where his
friend used togivehimanalms offoodandmake ameal himself, andthen
accompany himback totheMonastery, where hesattalking allthelivelong day
tillthesunwent down, when hewent back totown. And hisfriend the
Brother used toescort himonhishomeward way,going asfarasthecity-gates
before turning back.
Theintimacy ofthese twobecame known among theBrethren, whowere
sitting onedayintheHall ofTruth, talking about theintimacy which existed
between the pair,when theMaster, entering theHall, asked what wasthe
subject oftheir talk ;andtheBrethren toldhim.
"Notonlynow, Bretliren, arethese twointimate withoneanother," saidthe
Master; "they were intimate inbygone days aswell." And, sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta became hisminister. Inthose days there wasadogwhich

thecloggrew very friendly with theelephant, andatlastwould never eat
except with him.And neither could getonwithout theother. Thedog
used todisport himself byswinging backwards andforwards onthe
elephant's trunk. Now onedayavillager bought thedogofthemahout
andtook thedoghome with him. Thenceforward theelephant, missing
thedog,refused either toeatordrink ortake hisbath;andthekingwas
told ofit.Hismajesty despatched theBodhisatta tofindoutwhy the
elephant behaved like this.Proceeding totheelephant-house, theBodhisatta,
seeing howsadtheelephant was, said tohimself, "He hasgotnobodily
ailment ;hemust haveformed anardent friendship, and issorrowing at
the loss ofhisfriend." Soheasked whether theelephant hadbecome
friends with anyone.
"Yes,my lord," wastheanswer; "there's averywarm friendship
between himandadog." "Where isthatdognow?" "Amantook it
off'.""Doyouhappen toknow where thatman lives?" "No,mylord."
TheBodhisatta went tothekingand said, "There isnothing thematter
with theelephant, sire; buthewasvery friendly with adog,[190] and it
ismissing hisfriend which hasmadehim refuse toeat,Iimagine." And
sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Nomorsel canheeat,noriceorgrass;
And inthebath hetakes nopleasure now.
IMethinks, thedoghad sofamiliar grown,
That elephant anddog wei'e closest friends.
"Well," said theking onhearing this;"what istobedone now,
sage?" "Let proclamation bemade bybeatofdrum, your majesty, tothe
effect thataman isreported tohave carried oflJ"adogofwhich theelephant
ofstatewasfond, andthattheman inwhose house thatdogshall befound,
shallpaysuchandsuch apenalty." Theking acted onthisadvice ;and
theman,when hecame tohear ofit,promptly letthedog loose. Away
ranthedog atonce, andmade hisway totheelephant. Theelephant
took thedogupinhistrunk, andplaced itonhishead, andwept and
cried, and, again setting thedogontheground, sawthedogeat firstand
then took hisown food.
"Even theminds ofanimals areknown tohim," saidtheking, andhe
loaded theBodhisatta with honours.
Thus theMaster ended hislesson toshew that thetwowere intimate in

(This unfolding oftheFour Truths forms part ofalltheother Jatakas ;butwe

''ISpeak onlywords ofkindness."^—This storywastoldbytheMaster while at

Six,when they disagreed with respectable Brethren, used totaunt, revile and
jeerthem, andloadthem with thetenkinds ofabuse. This theBrethren
rc[)orted totheBlessed One,whosent fortheSixandasked whether thischarge
was true. Ontheir admitting itstruth, herebuked them, saying, "Brethren,
hard woi'ds galleven animals :inbygone days ananimal made amanwhohad

Once onatime at 'Jakkasila intlieland ofGandhara there wasakino-
reigning there, andtheBodhisatta came tolifeasabull.When hewas
quite atiny calf,hewaspresented byhisowners toabrahmin whocame
in—theybeingknown togiveaway presents ofoxen tosuch-like holymen.
Thebrahmin called itNandi-Visfda (Great- Joy),andtreated itlikehisown
child, feeding theyoung creature onrice-gruel and rice. When the
Bodhisatta gi-ew up,hethought thus tohimself, "Ihavebeenbrought up
bythisbrahmin with great pains, and allIndia cannot show thebullwhich
candrawwhat Ican.How ifIwere torepay thebrahmin thecost ofmy
nurture bymaking proof ofmystrength1"Accordingly, onedayhesaid
tothebrahmin, "Go,brahmin, tosomemerchant rich inherds, andwager

Thebrahmin went hisway toamerchant andgotintoadiscussion with
him astowhose oxen inthetown were thestrong. "Oh,so-and-so's,
orso-and-so's," saidthemerchant. "But," added he,"there arenooxen in
thetown which cancompare withmine forreal strength." Said the
brahmin, "Ihave abullwhocanpullahundred loaded carts." "Where's
such abull tobefound 1"laughed themerchant. "I've gothimathome,"
saidthebrahmin. "Make itawager." "Certainly," saidthebrahmin,
andstaked [192] athousand pieces. Then heloaded ahundred cartswith
sand, gravel, andstones, andleashed thelottogether, onebehind theother,
bycords from theaxle-tree oftheoneinfront tothetrace-bar ofits
successor. This done, hebathed Nandi-Visala, gavehim ameasure of
perfumed ricetoeat,hung agarland round hisneck, andharnessed him all

pole,andflourished hisgoad intheair,shouting, "Now then,yourascal!
pullthem along, yourascal!"
"I'm nottherascal hecallsme,"thought theBodhisatta tohimself;
andsoheplanted hisfour feet likesomany posts, andbudged notaninch.
Straightway, themerchant made thebrahmin payover thethousand
pieces. Hismoney gone, thebrahmin took hisbulloutofthecartandwent
home, where helaydown onhisbedinanagony ofgrief. When Nandi-
Visala strolled inandfound thebrahmin aprey tosuch grief, hewent up
tohimandeuquii-ed ifthebrahmiu were taking anap."How should Ibe
taking anap,when Ihavehadathousand pieceswon ofme"?""Brahmin,

"Then, whydidyou callmearascal? It'syouwho ai'etoblame, not I.
Goandbethimtwothousand thistime. Onlyremember nottomiscall me

andlaidawager oftwothousand. Just asbefore, heleashed thehundred
carts tooneanother andharnessed Naudi-Visala, very spruce and fine, to
theleading cart. Ifyouaskhowheharnessed him, well, hedid itinthis
way:—first,hefastened thecross-yoke ontothepole ;then heputthe
bull inonone side,andmade theother fastbyfastening asmooth piece
ofwood from thecross-yoke ontotheaxletree, sothat theyokewas
tautandcould notskew round either way. Thus asingle bullcoulddraw
acartmade tobedrawn bytwo. Sonowseated onthepole, thebrahmiu
stroked Nandi- Visala ontheback, andcalled onhim inthis style, "Now
then,myfinefellow !pullthem along,myfinefellow!"With asingle
pulltheBodhisatta tugged along thewhole string ofthehundred carts
[193] tillthehindermost stood where theforemost had started. The
merchant, rich inherds, paidupthetwothousand pieces hehad lostto
thebrahmin. Other folks, too,gave large sums totheBodhisatta, and
thewhole passed intothehands ofthebrahmin. Thus didhegain greatly
byreason oftheBodhisatta,
Thus laying down, byway ofrebuke totheSix, tlierulethathardwords

Bodhisatta came tolifeasabull.Andwhile hewas stillayoung calf, his
owners, whohadbeen lodging withanoldwoman, made himover toher

Butwhen theyoung merchant slipped acord [195] through the
Bodhisatta's noseandtried toleadhim off,thebullwould notbudge. For,

Rather, theyturned their chariot back, sacrificing great glory inorder tosave

thepast.
[199] Once onatime there wasaking ofMagadlia reigning at
Rajagaha inthelaud ofMagadha. And just asliewho isnowSakka
came tolifeinhispreceding birth inthehamlet ofMacala intheland
ofMagadha, even sowas itintheselfsame hamlet that theBodhisatta
came tolifeinthose days asayoung noble. When thedayforhisnaming
came, hewasnamed 'Prince Magha,' butwhen hegrew^ up, itwas as
*Magha theyoung Brahmin 'thathewasknown. Hisparents took a
wife forhimfrom afamily ofequal rank with theirown;and he,with a
family ofsonsanddaughters growing upround him, excelled incharity,
andkept theFiveCommandments.
Inthatvillage there were justthirty families, andonedaythemenwere
standing inthemiddle ofthevillnge transacting theaffairs ofthevillage.
TheBodhisatta hadkicked aside thedustfrom where hewasstanding,
andwasstanding there incomfort, when upcame another andtook his
stand there. Then theBodhisatta made himself another comfortable
standing-place, —only tohave ittaken fromhim likethe first. Again and
again theBodhisatta began afresh untilhehadmade comfortable standing-
places foreveryman there. Another time heputupapavilion,—which
lateronhepulled down, building ahallwith benches andajarofwater
inside. Another time these thirty menwere ledbytheBodhisatta to

become like-ininded with himself; heestablished them intheFiveCom-
mandments, andthenceforth used togoabout withthem doing good works.
And they toodoing good works, always intheBodhisatta's company, used
togetupearly and sally foi'tli, with razors andaxesandclubs intheir
hands. With their clubs they used torolloutoftheway allstones that
layonthefourhighways andother roads ofthevillage ;thetrees that
woidd strike against theaxles ofchariots, they cutdown ;rough places
tliey n)ade smooth;causeways they built, dugwater-tanks, and built a
hall ;theyshewed charity andkept theCommandments. Inthiswise
didthebody ofthevillagers generally abide bytheBodhisatta's teachings
andkeep theCommandments.
Thought thevillage headman tohimself, "When thesemenused to
getdrunk andcommit murders and soforth, Iused tomake alotof
money outofthem notonlyontheprice oftheir drinks butalsobythe
finesanddues they paid. Butnow hei-e's thisyoung brahmin Magha
bentonmaking them keep theCommandments ;heisputting astop to
nmrders andother crime." [200]And inhisragehecried, "I'llmake
them keep theFiveCommandments!"And herepaired totheking,
saying, "Sire, there isaband ofrobbers going about sacking villages and
committing other villanies." When theking heard this, hebade the
headman goandbring themenbefore him.Andaway went themanand
haided upasprisoners before theking every oneofthose thirty men,
representing them tobethe i-ascals. Without enquiry into their doings,
thekingcommanded offhand thatthey should betrampled todeath by
theelephant. Forthwith theymade them liedown intheking's court-
yardandsent fortheelephant. TheBodhisatta exhorted them, saying,
"Bear inmind theCommandments ;lovetheslanderer, thekingandthe
elephant asyourselves." Andthey didso.
Then theelephant wasbrought intotrample them todeath. Yet
leadhim asthey might, hewould notapproach them, but fledaway
trumpeting loudly. Elephant after elephant wasbrought up;—butthey
allfledaway likethe first. Thinking thatthemenmust havesome di-ug
about their persons, theking ordered them tobesearched. Search was
made accordingly, butnothing wasfound;—and sothey told theking.
"Then theynmst bemuttering some spell," said theking; "askthem
whether theyhave gotaspell tomutter."
Thequestion being puttothem, theBodhisatta saidtheyhadgota
spell. And thi.stheking's people told hismajesty. Sothekinghadthem
allsummoned tohispresence and said, "Tellmeyour spell."
TheBodhisatta made answei-, "Sire, wehave noother spellthan this,
thatnotamanamong thewhole thirty ofusdestroys life,ortakeswhat

digtanks, andbuild apublic hall j—this isour spell, oursafeguard, and
ourstrength."
Well-pleased with them, theking gavethem allthewealth inthe
slandei'er's house andmade him their slave ;andhegavethem the
elephant andthevillage toboot.
Thenceforward, doing goodworks totheir hearts' content, theysent for
acarpenter andcaused him toputupalarge hall atthemeeting ofthe
fourhighways; but[201] astheyhad lost alldesire forwomankind, they
would notletanywoman share inthegoodwork.
Now inthose clays there were fourwomen intheBodhisatta's house,
whose names weie Goodness, Thoughtful, Joy, and Highborn. Of
these Goodness, finding herself alone with thecarpenter, gave him a
douceur, saying,—"Brother, contrive tomakemethe])rincipal person in
connexion with this hall."
"Very good," said he.And before doing anyother work onthe
building, hehadsome pinnacle- wood dried, which hefashioned andbored
andmade into afinished pinnacle. This hewraj^ped upinacloth and
laid aside. When thehallwas finished, and itwastime toputonthe
pinnacle, heexclaimed, "Alas,mymasters, there's onethingwehave not
made." "What's thaf?" "Why, weought tohave apinnacle." "All
right, letonebegot." "But itcan't bemade outofgreen wood; weought
tohave apinnacle which hadbeen cutsome time ago,andfashioned, and
bored, andlaidby." "Well, what istobedonenow?" "Why, have a
lookround tosee ifanybody hasgotsuch athing inhishouse asaready-
made pinnacle forsale." Asthey looked round accordingly, they found
oneinthehouse ofGoodness, butcould notbuy itofherforanymoney.
"Ifyou willmakemeapartner inthegoodwork," said she,"Iwillgive
ityoufornothing."
"No," wasthereply, "wedonotletwomen have ashare inthegood
work."
Then said thecarpenter tothem, "Mymasters, what isthisyou
say? Save theRealm ofBrahma, there isnoplace from which
women are excluded. Take the pinnacle, and ourwork will be
complete."
Consenting, theytook thepinnacle andcompleted their hall. Theyhad
benches putup,andjars ofwater setinside, providing alsoaconstant
supply ofboiled rice.Round thehallthey built awallwith agate, strew-
ingthespace inside thewallwith sandandplanting arowoffan-palms
outside. Thoughtful toocaused apleasaunce tobelaidoutatthis spot,
andnotaflowering orfruit-bearing treecould benamed which didnot
grow there. Joy, too,caused awater-tank tobedug inthesame place,
covered over with thefivekinds oflotuses, beautiful tobehold. High-
born didnothing atall.

The Bodhisatta fulfillpd these seven injunctions, —tocherish one's
mother, tocherish one's fatlier, tohonour one's elders, tospeak truth, [202]
toavoid harsh speech, toeschew shmder, andtoshun uig,2;ardliness ;—
Whoso supports hisparents, honours age,
Isgentle, friendly-spoken, slandering not,
Unchurlish, truthful, lord—notslave—ofwrath,—Him e'entheThirty Threeishall hailasGood.
Such wasthepraiseworthy state towhich liegrew, and athis life's
close hepassed away tobereborn intheRealm oftheTliirty-three as
Sakka, king ofDevas ;andthere toowere hisfriends reborn.
Inthose days there wereAsuras dwelling intheRealm oftheThirty-
three. Said Sakka, King ofDevas, "What good tousisakingdom
which others share 1"Sohemade theAsuras drink theliquor ofthe
Devas, andwhen theywere drunken, hehadthem hurled bythefeeton
tothesteeps ofMount Sineru. They tumbled rightdown to'TheAsura
Realm,' asitiscalled,—aregion onthelowest level ofMount Sineru,
equal inextent totheRealm oftheThirty-three. Here grows atree,
resembling theCoral Tree oftheDevas, which lasts foranaeon and is
called thePied Trumpet-flower. Theblossoms ofthis treeshewed them
atonce that thiswasnottheRealm ofDevas, forthere theCoral Tree
blooms. Sothey cried, "OldSakka hasmade usdrunk and castusinto
thegreat deep, .seizing onourheavenly city." "Come," theyshouted, "let
uswinback ourownrealm fromhimbyforce ofarms." Andupthe
sides ofSineru they climbed, likeantsupapillar.
Hearing thealarm given that theAsuras were up,Sakka went out
into thegreat deep togivethem battle, butbeing woisted inthefight
turned and fledaway along crest after crest ofthesouthern deep inhis
*Chariot ofVictory,' which wasahundred and fiftyleagues long.
Now ashischariot sped along thedeep, itcame totheForest ofthe
Silk-Cotton Trees. Along thetrack ofthechariot these mighty trees
weremowed down like somany palms, and fellinto thedeep. And as
theyoung oftheGarujas hurtled through thedeep, loudwere their shrieks.
SaidSakka toMatali, hischarioteer, "Matali, myfriend, whatmanner of
noi.se isthis? [203]How heartrending itsounds." "Sire, itisthe
united cryoftheyoung Garulas intheagony oftheir fear, astheir forest
isuprooted bytherush ofyour chariot." Said theGreat Being, "Let
them notbetroubled because ofme, friend Matali. Letusnot, for
1One ofthedevalokas, orangelic realms, ofBuddhist cosmogony, was the
Tavatifiisa-hhavanam, or'Eealm oftheThirty-three,' socalled because itsdenizens
were subject tothirty-three Devas headed bySakka, theIndra ofthepre-buddhist
faith. Every world-system, itmay here beadded, hadaSakka ofitsown, asis
indicated infra.

empire's sake, soactastodestroy life. Eather will I,fortheir sake, give
my lifeasasacrifice totheAsuras. Turn thecarback." And sosaying,
herepeated thisstanza:—
Let alltheforest's nestlings, Matali,
Escape ourall-devouring chariot.
IoSer up,awilling sacrifice,
My lifetoyonder Asuras;these poor birds
Shall not,through me,from outtheir nests betorn.
Attheword, Matali, thecharioteer, turned thechariot round, andmade
fortheRealm ofDevas byanother route. Butthemoment theAsuras saw
himbegin toturn hischariot round, they cried outthattheSakkas ofother
worlds were sui-ely coming up;"itmust behisreinforcements which make
himturn hischariot back again." Trembling fortheir lives, they allran
away andnever stopped tilltheycame totheAsura Realm. AndSakka
entering heaven, stood inthemidst ofhiscity, girtround byanangelic
host ofhisownandofBrahma's angels. And atthatmoment through
theriven earth there roseupthe'Palace ofVictory,' some thousand
leagues high,—so-called because itarose inthehour ofvictory. Then, to
prevent theAsviras fromcoming back again, Sakka hadguards setinfive
places,—concerning which ithasbeen said:—
[204] Impregnable both cities stand !between,
Infivefold guard, watch Nagas, Garulas,
Kumbhandas, Goblins, andtheFour Great Kings !
Butwhen Sakka wasenjoying asking ofDevas theglory ofheaven,
safely warded byhissentinels atthese five posts. Goodness diedandwas
reborn asahandmaiden ofSakka oncemore. Andtheeffect ofhergiftof
thepinnacle wasthatthere arose forheramansion^named 'Goodness'—
studded with heavenly jewels, fivehundred leagues high, where, under a
white heavenly canopy ofroyal state, satSakka, king ofDevas, ruling men
andDevas.
Thoughtful, too, died,andwasoncemore born asahandmaiden of
Sakka ;andtheeffect ofheraction inrespect ofthepleasaunce wassuch
thatthere arose apleasaunce called 'Thoughtful's Creeper-Grove.' Joy, too,
diedandwasreborn oncemore asoneofSakka's handmaidens ;andthe
fruit ofhertankwasthatthere arose atank called 'Joy'after her. But
Highborn, [205] having performed noactofmerit, wasreborn asacrane
inagrotto intheforest.
"There's nosign ofHighborn," saidSakka tohimself; "Iwonder
where shehasbeen reborn." And asheconsidered thematter, hedis-
covered herwhereabouts. Sohepaidheravisit,andbringing herback
withhimtoheaven shewed herthedelightful cityoftheDevas, theHall of
Goodness, Thoughtful's Creeper-Grove, andtheTank called Joy. "These
three," saidSakka, "have been reborn asmyhandmaidens byreason of
c.J. 6

thegoodworks they did ;butyou,having done nogood work, have been
reborn inthebrute creation. Henceforth keep theCommandments."
Andhaving exhorted herthus,andconfirmed herintheFiveCommand-
ments, hetook herback and lethergofree.And thenceforth shedid
keep theCommandments.
Ashort time afterwards, being curious toknow whether shereally was
abletokeep theCommandments, Sakka went andlaydown before herin
the shajie ofafish. Thinking the fishwasdead, thecrane seized itby
thehead. The fishwagged itstail. "Why, Idobelieve it'salive," said
thecrane, and letthe fish go."Very good, very good," saidSakka;
"you willbeable tokeep theCommandments." And sosaying hewent
away.
Dying asacrane, Highborn wasreborn intothefamily ofapotter in
Benares. Wondering where shehadgot to,andatlastdiscovering her
whereabouts, Sakka, disguised asanoldman, filled acartwithcucumbers
ofsolid goldand satinthemiddle ofthe village, crying, "Buymy
cucumbers !buymycucumbers !"Folkcame tohimandasked forthem.
"Ionly partwiththem tosuch askeep theCommandments," said he,
"doyoukeepthem?" "We don'tknow what youmean byyour'Com-
mandments'; sellusthecucumbers." "No; Idon't wantmoney for
mycucumbei'S. Igivethem away,—butonly tothose thatkeep the
Commandments." "Who isthiswag 1"said thefolk asthey turned
away. Hearing ofthis.Highborn thought toherself thatthecucumbers
musthavebeenbrought forher,andaccordingly wentandasked forsome.
"Doyoukeep theCommandments, madam ]"said he. "Yes, Ido,"was
thereply. "Itwasforyoualone that Ibrought these here," said he,and
leaving cucumbers, cartand allatherdoorhedeparted.
Continuing allher lifelong tokeep theCommandments, Highborn
after herdeath wasreborn thedaughter oftheAsura king Vepacittiya,
andforhergoodness wasrewarded with thegiftofgreat beauty. When
shegrew wp,herfather mustered theAsuras together togive hisdaughter
herpick ofthem forahusband. [206]AndSakka, whohadsearched and
found outherwhereabouts, donned theshape ofanAsura, andcamedown,
saying tohimself, "IfHighborn chooses ahusband really after herown
heart, Ishall behe."
Highboi-n wasarrayed andbrought forth totheplace ofassembly,
where shewasbidden toselect ahusband after herown heart. Looking
round andobserving Sakka, shewasmoved byherlove forhim ina
bygone existence tochoose himforherhusband. Sakka carried her oflfto
thecityofthedevas andmade herthechief oftwenty-five millions of
dancing-girls. Andwhen histerm oflifeended, hepassed away tofare
according tohisdeserts.

Hislesson ended, theMaster rebuked thatBrother inthese words, "Thus,
Brethren, thewiseandgood ofbygone dayswhen theywere rulers oftheDevas,
forbore, even atthesacrifice oftheirown lives, tobeguilty ofslaughter. And
canyou,whohavedevoted yourself tososaving acreed, drink unstrained water

Right inthefaceofthewhole gathering King Royal Mallard gave his

the loss ofthemallard princess, [208] thepeacock rose straight upfrom
theplaceand fledaway. AndKing Golden Mallard toowentback tohis

"While concord reigns.^' This storywastoldbytheMaster while dwelling in
theBanyan-grove near Ka[)ilavatthu, about asquabble over aporter's head-pad,
aswillberelated intheKunala-jataka^
Onthis occasion, however, theMaster spoke thus tohiskinsfolk:—"My
lords, strifeamong kinsfolk isunseemly. Yes, inbygone times, animals, who
haddefeated theirenemies when they lived inconcord, came toutter destruction
when they fellout." And attherequest ofhisroyal kinsfolk, hetold thisstory
ofthepast.
Onceupon atimewhen Brahmadatta waskingofBenares, theBodhisatta
wasborn aquail, andlived intheforest atthehead ofmany thousands of
quails. Inthose days afowler whocaught quails came tothat place ;and
heused toimitate thenoteofaquail tillhesawthat thebirds hadbeen
drawn together, when heflung hisnetoverthem, andwhipped thesides
ofthenettogether, soastogetthem allhuddled upinaheap. Then
hecrammed them into hisbasket, andgoing home sold hisprey fora
living.
Now onedaytheBodhisatta saidtothose quails, "Thisfowler ismaking
havoc among ourkinsfolk. Ihave adevice whereby hewillbeunable to
catch us. Henceforth, theverymoment hethrows thenetover you, let
eachoneputhisheadthrough amesh andthen allofyoutogether must
flyaway with thenettosuch place asyouplease, andthere letitdown on
athoi-n-brake;thisdone, wewill allescape from ourseveral meshes."
"Very good," saidthey allinready agreement.
Onthemorrow, when thenetwascastoverthem, they didjust asthe
Bodhisatta had toldthem:—they lifted upthenet,[209] and letitdown
onathorn-brake, escaping themselves from underneath. While thefowler
was still disentangling hisnet,evening came on ;andhewentaway
empty-handed. Onthemorrow andfollowing days thequails played the
same trick. Sothat itbecame theregular thing forthefowler tobe
engaged tillsunset disentangling hisnet,andthen tobetake himself home
empty-handed. Accordingly hiswifegrew angry and said, "Daybyday
youreturn empty-handed ;Isuppose you'x'e gotasecond establishment to
keepupelsewhere."
1No.536.


86 TheJdtaka. Book I.
"No,mydear," saidthefowler; "I've nosecond establishment tokeep
lip.The fact isthose quails havecome towork together now. Themo-
mentmynet isoverthem, offthey flywith itandescape, leaving itona
thorn-brake. Still, they won't live inunity always. Don't youbother
yourself ;assoon asthey start bickering among themselves, Ishall bag
the lot,andthat willbring asmile toyour facetosee."And sosaying, he
repeated thisstanza tohiswife :—
While concord reigns, thebirds bear offthenet.
When quarrels rise, they'll fallaprey tome.
Notlong after this,oneofthequails, inalighting ontheir feeding-
ground, trodbyaccident onanother's head. "Who trodonmyhead 1"
angrily cried this latter. "Idid;butIdidn't mean to.Don't beangry,"
saidthe first quail. Butnotwithstanding thisanswer, theother remained
asangry asbefore. Continuing toanswer oneanother, theybegan to
bandy taunts, saying, "Isuppose itisyousingle-handed who liftupthe
net," Astheywrangled thuswith oneanother, theBodhisatta thought
tohimself, "There's nosafety with onewho isquarrelsome. Thetime
hascomewhen they willnolonger liftupthenet,andthereby they will
come togreat destruction. Thefowler willgethisopportunity. Ican
stay here nolongei'." And thereupon hewith hisfollowing went
elsewhere.
Sureenough thefowler [210] came back again afewdays later, and
first collecting them together byimitating thenote ofaquail, flung his
netoverthem. Then saidonequail, "They saywhen youwere atwork
lifting thenet,thehairofyourhead fell off.Now's your time; liftaway."
Theother rejoined, "When youwere lifting thenet,they saybothyour
wings moulted. Now's yourtime ;liftaway."
Butwhilst theywere each inviting theother toliftthenet,thefowler
himself lifted thenetforthemandcrammed them inaheap into hisbasket
andborethem offhome, sothat hiswife's facewaswreathed with smiles.
"Thus, sire," said theMaster, "such athing asaquarrel among kinsfolk
isunseemly;quarrelling leads only todestruction." Hislesson ended, heshewed
theconnexion, and identified theBirth, bysaying, "Devadatta wasthefoolish
quail ofthose days,and Imyself thewiseandgood quail."

"'Tis notthecold."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about being seduced bythewife ofone'smundane lifebefore joining theBrother-
hood. Said theMaster onthisoccasion, "Isittrue, asIhear, Brother, that
youarepassion-tost ?"
"Yes,Blessed One."
"Because ofwhom?"
"Myformer wife, sir,issweet totouch ;Icannot giveherup !"Then said
theMaster, "Brother, thiswoman ishurtful toyou. Itwasthrough herthat in
bygone times tooyouwere meeting your end,when youwere saved byme."
And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattabecame hisfamily-priest.
Inthose dayssome fishermen hadcasttheir netintotheriver. Anda
great bigfishcame along amorously toying with hiswife. She, scenting
thenetassheswam ahead ofhim,made acircuit round itandescaped.
Butheramorous spouse, blinded bypassion, sailed right intothemeshes
ofthenet.Assoon asthefishermen felthim intheir net,theyhauled it
inandtook thefishout ;they didnotkillhim atonce,butflunghimalive
onthesands. [211] "We'll cookhim intheembei's forourmeal," said
they ;andaccordingly they settowork tolight afireandwhittle aspitto
roasthimon.The fishlamented, saying tohimself, "It's notthetorture
oftheembers ortheanguish ofthespitoranyother pain thatgrieves me;
butonly thedistressing thought thatmywifeshould beunhappy inthe
belief that Ihavegone offwith another." Andherepeated thisstanza :
'Tisnotthecold, theheat, orwounding net;
'Tisbutthefearmydarling wifeshould think
Another's lovehaslured herspouse away.
Just then thepriest came totheriverside with hisattendant slaves
tobathe. Now heunderstood thelanguage ofallanimals. Therefore,
when heheard thefish's lamentation, hethought tohimself, "This fish is
lamenting thelament ofpassion. Ifheshould dieinthisunhealthy state
ofmind, hecannot escape rebirth inhell. Iwillsavehim." Sohewent
tothefishermen aad said, "Mymen, don't yousupply uswith afish

"praytakeaway withyouany fishyoumaytakeafancy to." "Wedon't

Taking thetishinhistwohands, theBodhisatta seated himself onthe
bankand said, "Friend fish, ifIhadnotseenyouto-day, youwould have
metyour death. Cease forthefuture tobetheslave ofpassion." And
with thisexhortation hethrew the fishintothewater, andwent intothe
city.
[212] Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theTruths, attheclosewhereof
thepassion-tost Brother won theFirst Path. Also, theMaster shewed the
connexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "Theformer wifewasthefemale

"With wings thatflynot."—This storywas toldbytheMaster, whilst on
analms-pilgrimage through Magadha, about thegoing-out ofajungle fire.
Once theMaster, whilst onanalms-pilgrimage through Magadha, went on
hismorning round foralms through acertain hamlet inthat country; on
hisreturn, after hismeal, hewent outagain followed bythecompany of
theBrethren. Just then agreat firebroke out. There werenumbers of
Brethren both infront oftheMaster andbehind him. Oncame the fire,
spreading farandwide, till allwasonesheet ofsmoke andflame. Hereupon,
some unconverted Brethren were seized with thefearofdeath. "Let usmake a
counter fire," they cried ;"andthen thebig firewillnotsweep overtheground
wehave fired." And, with this view, they setabout kindling afirewith their
tinder-sticks.
Butothers said, "What isthisyou do.Brethren ?You arelikesuch as
mark notthemoon inmid-heaven, orthesun's orbrising withmyriad rays
from theeast, ortheseaonwhose shores they stand, orMount Sineru towering
before their very eyes,—when, asyoujourney along inthecompany ofhim
who ispeerless among devas andmen alike, you give notathought tothe
All-Enlightened Buddha, butcryout,*Letusmake afire!'Youknow not
themight ofaBuddha !Come, letusgototheMaster." Then, gathering
together from front and rear alike, theBrethren inabody flocked round
theLord ofWisdom. Atacertain spot theMaster halted, with thismighty
assembly oftheBrethren surrounding him.Onrolled theflames, roaring
asthough todevour them. Butwhen theyapproached thespotwhere the
Buddha hadtaken hisstand, theycame nonearer than sixteen lengths, but
there andthenwent out,—even asatorch plunged into water. Ithadno
power tospread overaspace thirty-two lengths indiameter.


No. 35. 89
TheBrethren burst into praises oftheMaster, saying, "Oh !howgreat are
thevirtues ofaBuddha! For,even this fire,though lacking sense, could
notsweep over thespotwhere aBuddha stood, butwent out likeatorch in
water. Oh !howmarvellous arethepowers ofaBuddha!"
[213] Hearing their words, theMaster said, "Itisnopresent power ofmine,
Brethren, thatmakes this firegooutonreaching thisspot ofground. Itis
thei^ower ofaformer 'Act ofTruth' ofmine. For inthisspotnofire will
burn throughout thewhole ofthis aeon,—themiracle being onewhich endures
foranseon^."_
Then theElderAnanda folded arobe intofourandspread itfortheMaster to
siton.TheMaster took his seat. Bowing totheBuddha ashesatcross-
legged there, theBrethren tooseated themselves around him. Then theyasked
him, saying, "Only thepresent isknown tous,sir ;thepast ishidden from
us.Make itknown tous." And, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthe
joast.
Once upon atime intliisselfsame spot inMagadha, itwasasaquail
that theBodhisatta came tolifeonce more. Breaking hiswayoutofthe
shell oftheegginwhich hewasborn, hebecame ayoung quail, about as
bigasalarge ball^. And hisparents kepthimlying inthenest, while
they fedhimwith foodwhich theybrought intheir beaks. Inhimself, he
hadnotthestrength either tospread hiswings and flythrough the air,or
tolifthisfeetandwalkupon theground. Year after year that spotwas
always ravaged byajungle-fire;and itwasjust atthistime that the
flames sweptdown onitwith amighty roaring. The flocks ofbirds, dart-
ingfrom their several nests, were seized with thefear ofdeath, andflew
shrieking away. Thefather andmother oftheBodhisatta were asfrightened
astheothers andflewaway, forsaking theBodhisatta. Lying there inthe
nest, theBodhisatta stretched forth hisneck,andseeing theflames spreading
towards him,hethought tohimself, "Had Ithepower toputforthmy
wings and fly,Iwould wingmywayhence tosafety;or,ifIcouldmove
mylegsandwalk, Icould escape elsewhere afoot. Moreover, myparents,
seized with thefear ofdeath, arefledaway tosave themselves, leaving
mehere quite alone intheworld. Iamwithout protector orhelper.
What, then, shall Idothisday ?"
Then thisthought came tohim :—"Inthisworld there exists what is
termed theESicacy ofGoodness, andwhat istermed theEflicacy ofTruth.
There arethose who,through their having realised thePerfections inpast
ages,have attained beneath theBo-tree tobeAll-Enlightened;who,having
won Release bygoodness, tranquillity andwisdom, possess also discern-
ment oftheknowledge ofsuch Release; [214]who are filled with truth,
compassion, mercy, andpatience ;whose loveembraces allcreatures alike;
whommen callomniscient Buddhas. There isanefficacy intheattributes
theyhavewon.And Itoograsp onetruth ;Iholdandbelieve inasingle

ofthepast,andtheEfficacy theyhavewon,and tolayhold ofthetrue
belief that isinmetoiiching theprinciple ofNature ;andbyanActof
Truth tomake theflames goback, tothesaving both ofmyself andofthe
restofthebirds."
Therefore ithasbeen said:—
There's saving grace inGoodness inthisworld;
There's truth, compassion, purity oflife.
Thereby, I'llwork amatchless ActofTruth.
Remembering Faith's might, andtaking thought
Onthosewhotriumphed inthedays gone by,
Strong inthetruth, anActofTruth Iwrought.
Accordingly, theBodhisatta, calling tomind the efficacy ofthe
Buddhas long since pastaway, performed anActofTruth inthename of
thetrue faith thatwasinhim, repeating thisstanza:—
With wings that flynot, feetthatwalk notyet,
Forsaken bymyparents, here Ilie !
Wherefore Iconjure thee, dread Lord ofFire,
Primaeval Jataveda, turn !goback !
Even asheperformed hisActofTruth, Jataveda went back aspace of
sixteen lengths ;andingoing back theflames didnotpassaway tothe
forest devouring everything intheir path. No;theywent outthere and
then, likeatorch plunged inwater. Therefore ithasbeen said:—
[215] Iwrought myActofTruth, andtherewithal
Thesheet ofblazing fire leftsixteen lengths
Unscathed, —likeflames bywater metandquenched.
And asthatspotescaped being wasted byfirethroughout awhole aeon,
themiracle iscalled an'seon-miracle.' When hislifeclosed, theBodhi-
satta,whohadperformed thisActofTruth, passed away tofareaccording
tohisdeserts.
"Thus, Brethren," said theMaster, "it isnotmypresent power butthe
efficacy ofanAct ofTruth performed bymewhen ayoung quail, that has
made theflames passover thisspot inthejungle." Hislesson ended, hepreached
theTruths, attheclosewhereof somewontheFirst, some theSecond, some the
Third Path, while others again became Arahats. Also, theMaster shewed
theconnexion andidentified theBirth bysaying, "Mypresent parents were the
parents ofthose days,and Imyself theking ofthequails."

"Fedenizens ofair."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aBrother whose cellwasburnt down.
Tradition saysthataBrother, having beengiven atheme formeditation bythe
Master, wentfromJetavana totheland ofKosala andthere abode inadwelling
inaforest hard byaborder-village. Now, during thevery firstmonth of
hisdwelling there, hiscellwasburnt down. Tliishereported tothevillagers,
saying, "My cellhasbeen burnt down; Ilive indiscomfort." Said they,
"The land issuffering from drought justnow; we'll seetoitwhen wehave

when thefences were putup,theyhad firsttodotheweeding andthereaping,
andthethreshing; till,what with onejobandanother which they kept
mentioning, three whole months passed by.
After three months spent intheopen airindiscomfort, thatBrother had
developed histheme formeditation, butcould getnofurther. So,after the
Pavarana-festival which ends theRainy Season, hewent back again tothe
Master," and, with due salutation, took hisseat aside. After kindly words
ofgreeting, theMaster said,"Well, Brother, haveyoulived ha[)pily through the
Rainy Season? Didyourtheme formeditation endinsuccess?" TheBrother
toldhim allthathadhappened, adding, "As Ihadnolodging tosuitme,
mytheme didnotendinsuccess."

Thewiser birdswhofollowed theBodhisatta's counsels, atonce roseup

"Itisalways likethiswithhim;he'salways seeing crocodiles inadrop of

"For theywhohonour age."—This storywastoldbytheMaster whilst onhis
way toSavatthi, about theway inwhich theElder Sariputta waskept out
ofanight's lodging.
For,when Anatha-pindika had built hismonastery, andhadsentword
that itwasfinished, theMaster leftRajagaha andcame toVesali, setting outagain
onhisjourney after stopping atthelatter place during hispleasure. Itwas
now thatthedisciples oftheSixhurried onahead, and, before quarters could
betaken fortheElders, monopolized thewhole oftheavailable lodgings, which
they distributed among their superiors, their teachers, andthemselves. When
theElders cameuplater, they could findnoquarters atallforthenight. E^en
Sariputta's disciples, for alltheir searching, could not find lodgings forthe
Elder. Being without alodging, theElder passed thenight atthefoot of
atreenear the^Master's quarters, either walking u]ianddown orsitting atthe
footofatree.
Atearlydawn theMaster coughed ashecame out.TheElder coughed too.
"Who isthat?" asked theMaster. "It isI,Sariputta, sir.""What areyou
doing here atthis hour, Sariputta?" Then theElder told hisstory, atthe
close ofwhich theMaster thought, "Even now, while Iam still alive, the
Brethren lack courtesy andsubordination;what willthey notdowhen Iam
dead andgone?" And thethought filledhimwith anxiety fortheTruth.
Assoon asdayhadcome, hehadtheassembly oftheBrethren called together,
andasked them, saying, "Is ittrue, Brethren, asIhear, that theadherents
oftheSixwent onahead andkept theElders among theBrethren outof
lodgings forthenight?" "That isso.Blessed One," wasthereply. Thereupon,
withareproof totheadherents oftheSixandasalesson toall,headdressed the
Brethren, andsaid, "Tellme,whodeserves thebestlodging, thebestwater, and
thebest rice,Brethren?"


No. 37. 93
Some answered,"Hewhowasanobleman before hebecame aBrother." Others
said,"Hewhowasoriginally abrahmin, oraman ofmeans." Others severally
said,"Theman versed intheEules oftheOrder; themanwhocanexpound
theLaw; themenwhohavewonthe first, second, third, orfourth stage ofmystic
ecstasy." Whilst others again said,"Theman inthe First, Second, orThird
Path ofSalvation, oranArahat ;onewhoknows theThree Great Truths;one
whohastheSixHigher Knowledges."
After theBrethren hadstated whom they severally thought worthiest of
precedence inthematter oflodging andthe like, theMaster said, [218] "In
thereligion which Iteach, thestandard bywhich precedence inthematter
oflodging andthe like istobesettled, isnotnoble birth, orhaving been a
brahmin, orhaving beenwealthy before entry intotheOrder; thestandard isnot
familiarity with theEules oftheOrder, withtheSuttas, orwith theMetaphysical
Books 1;nor isiteither theattainment ofany ofthefour stages ofmystic
ecstasy, orthewalking inanyoftheFour Paths ofsalvation. Brethren, inmy
religion itisseniority which claims respect ofword anddeed, salutation, and
alldueservice ;itisseniors whoshould enjoy thebest lodging, thebestwater,
andthebest rice. This isthetrue standard, andtherefore thesenior Brother
ought tohnve these things. Yet, Bretliren, here isSariputta, who ismychief
disciple, whohassetrolling theWheel ofMinor Truth, andwho deserves to
have alodging next after myself. AndSariimtta hasspent thisnight without a
lodging atthefootofatree !Ifyoulackrespect andsubordination evennow,
what willbeyourbehaviour astime goesby?"
And fortheir further instruction hesaid, "Intimes past, Brethren, even
animals came totheconclusion that itwasnotproper forthem tolivewithout
respect andsubordination one toanother, orwithout theordering oftheir
common life;even these animals decided tofindoutwhich among them was
thesenior, andthen toshewhim allforms ofreverence. Sothey looked into
thematter, andhaving found outwhich ofthem wasthesenior, theyshewed
him allforms ofreverence, whereby they passed away atthat life's close to
people heaven." And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime, hard byagreat banyan-tree ontheslopes ofthe
Himalayas, there dwelt three friends,—apartridge, amonkey, andan
elephant. And theycame tolack respect and subordination one to
another, andhadnoordering oftheircommon life.And thethought
came tothem that itwasnotseemly forthem tolive inthisway,and
thattheyought tofindoutwhich oftheirnumber wasthesenior andto
honour him.
Astheywereengaged thinking which wastheoldest, onedayanidea
struck them. Said thepartridge andthemonkey totheelephant asthey
allthree sattogether atthefoot ofthat banyan-tree, "Friend elephant,
how bigwas thisbanyan when youremember itfirst?" Said the
elephant, "When Iwasababy, thisbanyan wasamere bush, overwhich
Iused towalk;and asIstood astride ofit,itstopmost branches used
just toreach uptomybelly. I'veknown thetree since itwasamere
bush."
'i.e.thethree divisions, or'three baskets,' oftheBuddhist scriptures,

Next themonkey wasasked thesame question bytheother two;and
hereplied, "My friends, when Iwasayoungling, [219] Ihadonly to
streich outmyneck asIsatontheground, andIcould eatthetopmost
sprouts ofthisbanyan. SoI'veknown thisbanyan since itwasvery
tiny."
Then thepartridge wasasked thesame question bythetwoothers;
andhesaid,"Friends, ofoldthere wasagreat banyan-tree atsuchand
such aspot ;Iateitsseeds, andvoided them here ;thatwastheorigin of
this tree. Therefore, Ihave knowledge ofthis treefrom before itwas
born, andamolder than thepairofyou."
Hereupon them.onkey andtheelephant said tothesage parti'idge,
"Friend, youaretheoldest. Henceforth yovi shall havefrom usacts of
honour andveneration, mai'ks ofobeisance andhomage, respect ofword
anddeed, salutation, and allduehomage ;andwewillfollow your counsels.
You foryour part hencefoi-th willplease impart such counsel asweneed."
Thenceforth thepartridge gavethem counsel, andestablished them in
theCommandments, which healsoundertook himself tokeep. Being
thus established intheCommandments, andbecoming respectful and
subordinate among themselves, with proper ordering oftheircommon
life, these three made themselves sure ofrebirth inheaven atthis life's
close.
"Theaims ofthese three "—continued theMaster—"came tobe
known asthe'Holiness ofthePartridge,' and ifthese three animals.
Brethren, lived together inrespect andsubordination, howcanyou,who
haveembraced aFaith theRules ofwhich aresowell-taught, livetogether
without duerespect andsubordination ?Henceforth Iordain, Brethi'en,
that toseniority shall bepaid respect ofwordanddeed, salutation, and all
dueservice ;that senioiity shall bethe title tothebest lodging, thebest
water, andthebest rice ;andnevermore letasenior bekept outof
alodging byajunior. Whosoever sokeeps outhissenior commits an
offence."
Itwasattheclose ofthislesson thattheMaster, asBuddha, repeated
thisstanza:—
Fortheywhohonour age, inTruth areversed;
Praise now,and bliss hereafter, istheir meed.
[220]When theMaster had finished speaking ofthevirtue ofreverencing
age,hemade theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "Moggallana

''Guile profits not."—This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about atailoring Brother.
Tradition saysthat atJetavana dwelt aBrother whowasexceedingly skilful
inalloperations tobeperformed with arobe, such ascutting, joining, ar-
ranging, and stitching. Because ofthis skill, heused tofashion robes andso
gotthename of'The Robe-tailor.' What, you ask, didhedo?—Well, he
exercised hiscraft onoldbitsofclothandturned outanice softrobe, which,
after thedyeing wasdone, hewould enhance incolour with awash containing
flour tomake adressing, andrub itwith ashell, tillhehadmade itquite smart
andattractive. Then hewould layhishandiwork aside.
Being ignorant ofrobe-making, Brethren used tocome tohimwithbrand-new
cloth, saying, "We don'tknowhow tomake robes; youmakethem forus."
"Sirs," hewould reply, "arobe takes alongtimemaking; but Ihave one
which isjust finished. Youcantake that, ifyou willleave these cloths in
exchange." And, sosaying, hewould take hisoutandshew itthem. And they,
marking only itsfine colour, andknowing nothing ofwhat itwasmade ofj
thought itwasagood strong one,andsohanded over theirbrand-new cloth to
the'Robe-maker' andwent offwith therobe hegave them. When itgot
dirty andwasbeing washed inliotwater, itrevealed itsreal character, and
theworn patches were visible hereandthere. Then theowners regretted their
bargain. Everywhere thatBrother became well-known forcozening inthisway
allwhocame tohim.
Now, therewasarobe-maker inahamlet whoused tocozen everybody just
asthebrother didatJetavana. [221] Thisman's friends among theBrethren
saidtohim, "Sir, they saythat atJetavana there isarobe-maker whocozens
everybody just likeyou." Then thethought struck him,"Come now, letme
cozen that cityman !"Sohemade outofragsavery finerobe,which hedyed a
beautiful orange. Thisheputonandwent toJetavana. Themoment theother
saw it,hecoveted it,andsaid toitsowner, "Sir, didyoumake that robe?"
"Yes, Idid, sir,"wasthereply. "Letmehave that robe, sir; you'll getanother
initsplace." "But, sir,wevillage-Brethren find ithard togettheRequisites;
ifIgiveyou this,what shall Ihave towear myself?" "Sir, Ihavesome brand-
new cloth atmylodging; take itandmake yourself arobe." "Reverend sir,
herein have Ishewnmyownhandiwork ;but, ifyouspeak thus, what can I
do?Take it."Andhaving cozened theother byexchanging therag-robe for
thenew cloth, hewent hisway.
After wearing thebotched robe inhisturn, theJetavana manwaswashing
itnotlong afterwards inwarm water, when hebecame aware that itwasmade
outofrags; andhewasputtoshame. Thewhole oftheBrotherhood heard
thenews that theJetavana manhadbeen cozened byarobe-tailor from the
country.


96 TheJataha. Book I.
Now, onedaytheBrethren were seated intheHall ofTruth, discussing the
news,when theMaster entered andasked what theywere discussing;andthey
toldhim allabout it.
Said theMaster, "Brethren, this isnottheonly occasion oftheJetavana
robe-maker's cozening tricks ;inbygone times alsohedidjustthesame, and, as
hehasbeen cozened nowbythemanfrom thecountry, sowashetooinbygone
times." And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime theBodhisatta came tolifeinacertain forest-haunt
astheTree-sprite ofatreewhich stood near acertain lotus-pond. In
those days thewater used every summer tofallverylowinacertain
pond, notvery big,—which was plentifully stocked witli fish. Catching
sight ofthese fish,acertain crane saidtohimself, "Imust findaway to
cajole andeatthese fish." Sohewent and satdown indeepthought by
thesideofthewater.
Nowwhen thefishes caught sight ofhim,they said,"Ofwhat areyou
thinking, mylord, asyou sitthere"?" "Iamthinking about you," was
the reply. "And what isyour lordship thinking about us?" "The
water inthispoolbeing low, food scarce, andtheheat intense,—Iwas
wondering tomyself, asIsathere, what intheworld you fishes would
do.""And what arewetodo,mylord?" "Well, ifyou'll takemy
advice, [222] Iwilltakeyouuponebyoneinmybeak, andcarry you all
offtoafine lai'ge poolcovered with thefivevarieties oflotuses, and thei'e
putyoudown." "Mylord," said they, "nocrane evertook theslightest
thought forfishes since theworld began. Your desire istoeatusoneby
one." "No;Iwillnoteatyouwhile youtrustme," saidthecrane. "If
you don't takemyword that there issuch apond, send one ofyour
number togowithmeandseeforhimself." Believing thecrane, the fish
presented tohim agreat bigfish(blind ofoneeye,bytheway),whothey
thought would beamatch forthecrane whether afloat orashore ;and
they said, "Here's theonetogowith you."
Thecrane took thefishoffandputhim inthepool,andaftershewing
himthewhole extent ofit,brought himback again andputhiminalong
with theother fishinhisoldpond. And heheld forth tothem onthe
chai-ms ofthenew pool.
After hearing thisreport, theygrew eager togothere, andsaid tothe
crane, "Very good,mylord;please take usacross."
First ofall, tliecrane took that bigone-eyed fishagain andcarried
him offtotheedge oftiiepool, sothathecould seethewatei', butactually
alighted inaVarana-tree which grew onthebank. Dashing the fish
down inafork ofthe tree, hepecked ittodeath,—after which hepicked
him clean and letthebones fallatthefoot ofthe tree. Then back he
wentand said, "I'vethrown him in;who's thenextl"And sohetook
the fishonebyone,and atethem all, tillatlastwhen hecame back, he

could notfindanother left. But there was stillacrabremaining inthe
pond; sothecrane, whowanted toeathimuptoo,said,"Mister crab, I've
taken allthose fishesaway andturned them intoafinelarge poolcovered
alloverwith lotuses. Come along; I'lltakeyoutoo." "How willyou
carrymeacross]" saidthecrab. "Why, inmybeak, tobesure," said
thecrane. "Ah, butyoumight dropmelike that," said thecrab; "I
won't gowith you." "Don't befrightened ;I'llkeep tight hold ofyou
alltheway." Thought thecrab tohimself, "Hehasn't putthefishinthe
pool. But, ifhewould really putmein,thatwould becapital. Ifhe
does not,—why, I'llniphishead offand killhim." Sohespoke thus to
thecrane, "You'd never beable toholdmetight enough, friend crane;
whereas wecrabs have gotanastonishingly tight grip. [22-3] IfImight
take hold ofyour neck withmyclaws, Icould hold ittight andthen
would goalong with you."
Notsuspecting that thecrabwanted totrick him, thecrane gave his
assent. With hisclaws thecrab gripped hold ofthecrane's neck aswith
thepincers ofasmith, and said, "Now youcanstart." Thecrane took
himandshewed himthepool first,andthen started off*forthetree.
"The pool liesthisway, nunky," saidthecrab; "but you're taking
metheother way." "Very much yournunky dearamI!" saidthe
crane ;"andverymuchmynephew areyou !Isuppose youthought me
your slave toliftyouupandcarry youabout !Justyoucastyour eyeon
thatheap ofbones atthefootofthetree ;asIateupallthose fish, soI
willeatyou too." Said thecrab, "Itwasthrough theirown folly that
those fishwere eaten byyou;butIshan't giveyouthechance ofeating
me.No ;what Ishall do, istokill i/07i. Foryou, foolthatyouwere,
didnotseethat Iwasti-icking you. Ifwedie,wewillboth dietogether;
I'llchop your head clean off"."And sosaying hegripped thecrane's
weazand with hisclaws, aswith pincers. With hismouth wide open, and
tears streaming from hiseyes, thecrane, trembling forhis life, said,
"Lord, indeed Iwillnoteatyou !Sparemy life !"
"Well, then, just stepdown tothepoolandputmein,"saidthecrab.
Then thecrane turned backandstepped down asdirected tothepool,and
placed thecrabonthemud, atthewater-edge. But the crab, before
entering thewater, nipped offthecrane's head asdeftly asifhewere
cutting alotus stalk with aknife.
The Tree- fairywhodwelt inthe tree,marking thiswonderful thing,
made thewhole forest ringwith applause repeating thisstanza insweet
tones:—
Guile profits notyour very guileful folk.
Mark what theguileful crane gotfrom thecrab!

"Methinhs thegold.^^ —T\\\s, storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aco-resident pupil ofSariputta.
Tradition says that thisBrother wasmeek and docile, andwaszealous in
ministering totheElder. Now, ononeoccasion theElder departed with the
leave oftheMaster, onanalms-pilgrimage, andcame toSouth Magadha. When
hegotthere, that Brother grew soproud-stomached tliat hewould notdo
what theElder toldhim. Moreover, ifhewasaddressed with, "Sir,dothis," he
quarrelled with theElder. TheElder could notmake outwhat possessed him.
Aftermaking hisj^ilgrimage inthose parts, hecame back again toJetavana.
Themoment hegotback tothemonastery atJetavana, theBrother became
againwhat hehadalways been.
TheElder told this totheBuddha, saying, "Sir, aco-resident ofmine isin
oneplace likeaslave bought forahundred pieces, and inanother soproud-
stomached thatanorder todoanything makes himquarrel."
SaidtheMaster, "This isnotthe firsttime, Sariputta, thathehasshewn this
disposition ;inthepast too, ifhewent tooneplace, hewas likeaslavebought
forahundred pieces, whilst, ifhewent toanother place, hewould become
quarrelsome andcontentious." And, sosaying, byrequest oftheElder, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asasquire. Another squire, afriend ofhis,
wasanoldman himself, buthad[225] ayoung wifewhohadborne hima
sonand heir. Said theoldman tohimself, "Assoon asIamdead, this
girl,being soyoung asshe is,willmarry heaven knows whom, andspend
allmymoney, instead ofhanding itover tomyson. Wouldn't itbemy
bestcourse toburymymoney safely intheground?"
So,inthecompany ofahousehold slave ofhisnamed Nanda, hewent
totheforest andburied hisriclies atacertain spot, saying totheshxve,


No. 39. 99
"My good Nanda, reveal thistreasure tomysonafter Iamgone, and
don't letthewood besold."
After giving thisinjunction tohisslave, theoldman died. Indue
course thesongrew up,and hismother said tohim, "My son,your
father, inthecomi)any ofNanda, buried hismoney. Get itbackandlook
after theproperty ofthefamily." 80onedayhesaid toNanda, "Nunky,
isthere any treasure which myfather buried1""Yes,my lord."
"Where isitburied1""Intheforest,mylord." "Well, then, letusgo
there." Andhetook aspade andabasket, andgoing tothescene, saidto
Nanda, "Well, nunky, where's themoney 1"ButbythetimeNanda had
gotuptothetreasure andwasstanding right over it,hewas sopufied up
bythemoney thatheabused hismaster, saying, "Youservant ofaslave-
wench's son !howshould youhaveanymoney here?"
Theyoung gentleman, pretending nottohave heard this insolence,
simply said, "Letusbegoing then," andtook theslave backhome with
him.Two orthree days later, hereturned totheplace ;butagainNanda
abused him, asbefore. Without anyabusive rejoinder, theyoung gentle-
mancame back andturned thematter over inhismind. Thought heto
himself, "At starting, this slave always means toreveal where themoney
is;butnosooner doeshegetthere, than hefalls toabusing me.The
reason ofthis Idonotsee;but Icould find out, ifIwere toaskmy
father's oldfriend, thesquire." Sohewent totheBodhisatta, andlaying
thewhole business before him,asked hisfriend what wasthereal i-eason
ofsuch behaviour.
SaidtheBodhisatta, "Thespot atwhich Nanda stands toabuse you,
myfriend, istheplacewhere your father's money isburied. Therefore, as
soon ashestarts abusing youagain, saytohim,'Whom areyoutalking
to,you slave?' Pullhimfrom hisperch, take thespade, digdown,
remove your family treasui-e, andmake theslave caiTy ithome foryou."
And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—[226]
Methinks thegoldandjewels buried lie
Where Nanda, low-born slave, soloudly bawls!
Taking arespectful leave oftheBodhisatta, theyoung gentleman went
home, andtaking Nanda went tothespotwhere themoney was buried.
Faithfully following theadvice hehad received, hebrought themoney
away andlooked after thefanuly property. Heremained steadfast inthe
Bodhisatta's counsels, and after alifespent incharity andother good
works hepassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Said theMaster, "Inthepast toothismanwassimilarly disposed." His

KHADIRA>;GARA- JATAK A,
''Far rather in'llIheadlong plunge."—This story was toldbytheMaster
while atJetavana, about Anatha- pindika.
ForAiiatha-pindika, whohadlavished fifty-four crores ontheFaith ofthe
Buddha overtheMonastery alone, andwhovalued naught elsesaveonlytheThree
Gems, used togoevery daywhile theMaster wasatJetavana toattend the
Great Services,—once atdaybreak, once after breakfast, and once inthe
evening. There were intermediate services too; buthenever went empty-
handed, forfeartheNovices andladsshould look toseewhat hehadbrought
withhim.When hewent intheearlymorning [227], heused tohave rice-gruel
taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, andthelike;andin
theevening, hebrought perfumes, garlands and cloths. Somuch didheexpend
day after day, that hisexpense knew nobounds. Moreover, many traders
borrowed money fromhimontheir bonds,—totheamount ofeighteen crores;
and thegreat merchant never called themoney in.Furthermore, another
eighteen crores ofthefamily property, which were buried intheriver-bank, were
washed outtosea,when thebankwasswept away byastorm ;anddown rolled
thebrazen pots, with fastenings andsealsunbroken, tothebottom oftheocean.
Inhishouse, too,there wasalways ricestanding ready for500Brethren,—so
that themerchant's house was totheBrotherhood likeapooldugwhere four
roads meet, yea, likemother andfather washetothem. Therefore, even the
All-Enlightened Buddha used togotohishouse, andtheEighty Chief Elders
too ;andthenumber ofother Brethren passing inandoutwasbeyond measure.
Now hishouse wasseven stories highandhadseven portals ;andoverthe
fourth gateway dwelt afairywhowasaheretic. When theAll-Enlightened
Buddha came intothehouse, shecould notstay inherabode onhigh, butcame
down withherchildren totheground-floor ;andshehadtodothelikewhenever
theEighty Chief Elders ortheother Elders came inandout. Thought she,"So
long astheascetic Gotama and hisdisciples keepcoming into thishouse, Ican
havenopeace here; Ican't beeternally coming downstairs totheground floor.
Imust contrive tostopthem fromcoming anymore tothishouse." Sooneday,
when thebusiness manager hadretired torest, sheappeared before him in
visible shape.
"Who isthat?" said he.
"It isI,"wasthereply; "the fairywho lives over thefourth gateway."
"What brings youhere?" "You don't seewhat themerchant isdoing. Heedless
ofhisown future, heisdrawing upon hisresources, only toenrich theascetic
Gotama. Heengages innotraftic ;heundei-takes nobusiness. Advise the
merchant toattend tohisbusiness, andarrange thattheascetic Gotama with his
disciples shallcomenomore intothehouse."
Then said he,"Foolish Fairy, ifthemerchant does spend hismoney, he
spends itontheFaith oftheBuddha, which leads toSalvation. Even if
hewere toseizemebythehairand sellmeforaslave, Iwillsaynothing.
Begone!"
Another day,shewent tothemerchant's eldest sonandgavehimthesame
advice. Andheflouted herinjustthesame manner. But tothemerchant
himself shedidnotsomuch asdare tospeak onthematter.
Nowbydint ofunending munificence [228] andofdoing nobusiness, the
merchant's incomings diminished andhisestate grew lessand less; sothathe
sankbydegrees intopoverty, andhistable, hisdress, andhisbedandfoodwere
nolonger what theyhadonce been. Yet, inspite ofhisaltered circumstances,


No. 40. 101
hecontinued toentertain theBrotherhood, though hewasnolonger able tofeast
them. Soonedaywhen heiiadmade liisbowandtaken hisseat, theMaster said
tohim, "Householder, aregiftsbeing given atyour house"?" "Yes, sir,"saidhe;
"but there's onlyalittle sourhusk-porridge, leftoverfrom yesterday." "Benot
distressed, householder, atthethought thatyoucanonly oflferwhat isun-
palatable. Iftheheart begood, thefoodgiven toBuddhas, Pacceka Buddhas^,
andtheir disciples, cannot butbegood too.Andwhy?—Because ofthegreat-
ness ofthefruit thereof. Forhewhocanmake hisheart acceptable cannot
giveanunacceptable gift,— asistobetestified bythefollowing passage:—
For, iftheheart have faith, nogift issmall
ToBuddhas ortotheir disciples true.
'Tis saidnoservice canbereckoned small
That's paid toBuddhas, lords ofgreat renown.
Mark wellwhat fruit rewarded thatpoor gift
Ofpottage,—dried-up, sour,andlacking salt^."
Also, hesaid this fiu'ther thing, "Householder, ingiving thisunpalatable
gift,youaregiving ittothosewhohave entered ontheNoble Eightfold Path.
Whereas I,when inVelama's time Istirred upallIndia bygiving theseven
things ofprice, and inmylargesse poured them forth asthough 1hadmade
intoonemighty stream thefivegreat rivers,—Iyetfound nonewhohadreached
theThree Befuges orkept theFiveCommandments; forrare arethosewho
areworthy ofofferings. Therefore, letnotyour heart betroubled bythe
thought that your gift isunpalatable." And sosaying, herepeated the
Velamaka Sutta^.
Now that fairywhohadnotdared tospeak tothemerchant inthedays of
hismagnificence, thought thatnowhewaspoorhewould hearken toher,and so,
entering hischamber atdead ofnight sheappeared before him invisible shape,
standing inmid-air. "Who's thatf saidthemerchant, when hebecame aware
ofherpresence."Iamthefairy, great merchant, who dwells over thefourth
gateway." "What brings youhere?" "Togiveyoucounsel." "Proceed, then."
"Great merchant, youtakenothought foryourown future orforyourown
children. Youhaveexpended vastsums ontheFaith oftheascetic Gotama; in
fact,bylong-continued [229] expenditure andbynotundertaking newbusiness
youhave been brought bytheascetic Gotama topoverty. Buteven inyour
poverty youdonotshake off"theascetic Gotama !The ascetics areinandout

yourself totheascetic Gotama anddon't lethisdisciples setfoot inside youi-
house. Donoteven turn tolook attheascetic Gotama butattend toyour trade
and traffic inorder torestore thefamily estate."
Then hesaid toher,"Was thisthecounsel youwanted togiveme?"
"Yes, itwas."
Saidthemerchant, "The mighty Lord ofWisdom hasmademeproof against
ahundred, athousand, yeaagainst ahundred thousand fairies such asyouare!
Myfaith isstrong and steadfast asMount Sineru! Mysubstance hasbeen
expended ontheFaith thatleads toSalvation. Wicked areyourwords;itisa

childreu bythehandandweut forth. Butthough shewent, shewasminded, if
shecould notfind herself alodging elsewhere, toappease themerchant and
return todwell inhishouse ;andinthismind sherepaired tothetutelary deity
ofthecityandwithduesalutation stood before him. Being asked what had
brought herthither, shesaid,"My lord, Ihave been speaking imprudently to
Anatha-pindika, andheinhisanger hasturned meoutofmyhome. Takeme
tohimandmake itupbetween us,sothathemay letmelivethere again."
"Butwhatwas ityousaidtothemerchant?" "Itoldhim forthefuture notto
support theBuddha andtheOrder, andnottolettheascetic Gotama setfoot
again inhishouse. This iswhat Isaid,mylord." "Wicked wereyour woi-ds;
itwasablowaimed attheFaith. Icannot takeyouwithmetothemerchant."
Meeting withnosupport from him, shewent totheFour C4reat Regents ofthe
world. Andbeing repulsed bythem inthesame manner, shewentontoSakka,
king ofDevas, and toldhimherstory, beseeching him stillmore earnestly, as
follows, "Deva, finding noshelter, Iwander about homeless, leading mychildren
bythehand. Grantmeofyourmajesty some place wherein todwell."
Andhetoosaid tolier,"You havedone wickedly; itwasablowaimed at
theConqueror's Faith. Icannot speak tothemerchant onyour behalf. But I
can tellyouoneway [230] whereby themerchant maybeledtopardon you."
"Pray tellme,deva." "Alen have hadeighteen crores ofthemerchant on
bonds. Take thesemblance ofhisagent, andwithout telling anybody repair to
their houses with thebonds, inthecompany ofsomeyoung goblins. Stand inthe
middle oftheir houses withthebond inonehandandareceipt intheother, and
terrify them withyour goblin power, saying, 'Here's youracknowledgment of
thedebt. Ourmerchant didnotmove inthematter while hewasaffluent ;but
nowheispoor, andyoumust payupthemoney you owe.' Byyour goblin
power obtain allthose eighteen crores ofgoldand fillthemerchant's empty
treasuries. Hehadanother treasure buried inthebanks oftheriver AciravatI,
butwhen thebankwaswashed away, thetreasiu'e wasswept intothesea. Get
thatback alsobyyoursupernatural power andstore itinhistreasuries. Further,
there isanother sum ofeighteen crores lyingunowned insuchandsuch aplace.
Bring thattooandpour themoney into hisempty treasuries. When youhave
atoned bytherecovery ofthese fifty-four crores, askthemerchant toforgive
you." "Very good, deva," said she.And shesettowork obediently, anddid
justasshehadbeen bidden. When shehadrecovered allthemoney, shewent
intothemerchant's chamber atdead ofnight andappeared before himinvisible
shape standing inthe air.
Themerchant asking whowas there, shereplied, "It isI,great merchant,
theblindandfoolish fairywho lived overyour fourth gateway. Inthegreatness
ofmyinfixtuate folly Iknew notthevirtues ofaBuddha, andsocame tosay
what Isaid toyousome days ago. Pardon memyfault !Attheinstance of
Sakka, king ofDevas, Ihavemade atonement byrecovering theeighteen crores
owing toyou, theeighteen crores which hadbeenwashed down intothesea,and
another eighteen crores which were lyingunowned insuchandsuchaplace,—
making fifty-four crores inall,which Ihavepoured intoyourempty treasure-
chambers. Thesumyouexpended ontheMonastery atJetavana isnowmade
upagain. Whilst Ihavenowhere todwell, Iaminmisery. Bear notinmind
what Ididinmyignorant folly, great merchant, butpardon me."
Anatha-pindika, hearing what shesaid,thought tohimself, "She isafairy,
andshesaysshehasatoned, andconfesses herfault. TheMaster shall consider
thisandmake hisvirtues known toher. Iwilltakeherbefore theAll-En-
lightened Buddha." Sohesaid,"Mygood fairy, ifyouwantmetopardon you,
askmeinthepresence ofthemaster." "Very good," said she,"1will.Takeme
along withyoutotheMaster." "Certainly," said he.And early inthemorning,
when night wasjustpassing away, hetook herwithhimtotheMaster, andtold
theBlessed One allthatshehaddone.
Hearing this, theMaster said,"You see,householder, how thesinfulman
regards sin[231] asexcellent before itripens toitsfruit. Butwhen ithas
rii)ened, thenhesees sintobesin. Likewise thegoodman looks onhisgoodness


No. 40. 103
assillbefore itripens toitsfruit; butvvheu itripens, liesees ittobegoodness."
And sosaying, herepeated these twostanzas from theDhamniapada: —
Thesinner thinks hissinful deed isgood.
Solong assinhasripened nottofruit.
Butwhen hissinatlast toripeness grows.
Thesinner surely sees"'twas sin Iwrought."
Thegoodman thinks hisgoodness isbut sin.
Solong asithasripened nottofruit.
Butwhen hisgoodness unto ripeness grows.
Thegoodman surely sees"'twas good Iwrought'."
Attheclose ofthese stanzas that fairywasestablished intheFruit ofthe
First Path. She fellattheWheel-marked feet oftheMaster, crying, "Stained
asIwaswith passion, depraved bysin,misled bydelusion, andblinded by
ignorance, Ispoke wickedly because Iknew notyour virtues. Pardon me!"
Then shereceived pardon from theJMaster andfrom thegreat merchant.
Atthistime Anatha-pindika sang hisown praises intheMaster's presence,
saying, "Sir, though this fairy didherbest tostopmefrom giving support to
theBuddha andhisfollowing, shecould notsucceed ;andthough shetried to
stopmefrom giving gifts, yet Igavethem still !Was notthisgoodness onmy
part?"
Said theMaster, "You, householder, areaconverted manandanelect
disciple; your faith isfirmandyour vision ispurified. Nomarvel then that
youwere notstopped bythisimpotent fairy. Themarvel wasthatthewiseand
good ofabygone da}',when aBuddha hadnotappeared, andwhen knowledge
hadnotripened toitsfull fruit, should from theheart ofalotus-flower have
given gifts, although MUra, lordoftheRealm ofLusts, appeared inmid-heaven,
shouting, 'Ifyougive gifts, you shall beroasted inthis hell,'—andshewing
them therewithal apiteighty cubits deep, filled with red-hot embers." And so
saying, attherequest ofAnatha-pindika, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahraadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolife inthefamily oftheLordHigh Treasurer of
Benares, andwasbrought upinthelapofallluxury likearoyal prince.
Bythetimehewascome toyears ofdiscretion, being barely sixteen years
old,hehadmade himself perfect inallaccomplishm(;nts. Athisfather's
death hefilled theoffice ofLordHigh Treasurer, and built sixalmonries,
oneateach ofthefourgates ofthecity,oneinthecentre ofthecity,and
oneatthegate ofhisownmansion. Very bountiful washe[232], andhe
kept thecommandments, andobserved thefast-day duties.
Now onedayatbreakfast-time when dainty fareofexquisite taste and
variety wasbeing brought infortheBodhisatta, aPacceka Buddha rising
fi'om aseven days' trance ofmystic ecstasy, and noticing that itwas
time togohisrounds, bethought himthat itwould bewell tovisit the
Treasurer ofBenares thatmorning. Sohecleaned histeeth with atooth-
stickmade from thebetel-vine, washed hismouth with water fromLake
Anotatta, putonhisunder-cloth ashestood onthetableland ofManosila,
fastened onhisgirdle, donned hisouter-cloth ;and,equipped with abowl

which hecalled intobeiug forthepurpose, hepassed through theairand
arrived atthegateofthemansion just astheBodhisatta's breakfast was
taken in.
Assoon astheBodhisatta became aware ofhispresence there, herose
atoncefrom hisseatandlooked attheattendant, indicating thataservice
was required. "What amItodo,mylord?'' "Bring hisreverence's
bowl," saidtheBodhisatta.
Atthat very instant Mara theWicked roseupinastate ofgreat
excitement, saying, "Itisseven days since thePacceka Buddha hadfood
givenhim;ifhegetsnone to-day, hewillperish. Iwilldestroy himand
stoptheTreasurer toofrom giving." And thatvery instant hewent and
called intobeing within themansion apitofred-hot embers, eighty cubits
deep, filled with Acacia-charcoal, allablaze andaflame likethegreat hell
ofAvici. When hehadcreated this pit,Mara himself took hisstand in

When themanwhowasonhiswaytofetch thebowlbecame aware of
this,hewas terrified andstarted back. "What makes youstart back,my
mani" asked theBodhisatta. "My lord," wastheanswer, "there's a
great pitofred-hot enibeis blazing andflaming inthemiddle ofthe
house." And asman afterman gottothespot, they allwere panic-
stricken, andranaway asfastastheir legswould carry them.
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "Mara, theEnthraller, must have
been exerting himself to-day tostopmefrom alms-giving. Ihave yetto
learn, however, that Iamtobeshaken byahundred, orbyathousand,
Maras. Wewillseethisdaywhose strength isthestronger, whose might
isthemightier, mine orMara's." Sotakiug inhisownhand thebowl
which stood ready, hepassed outfrom thehouse, and, standing onthe
brink ofthe fiery pit,looked uptotheheavens. Seeing Mara, hesaid,
"Who areyou ]""IamMara," wastheanswer.
"Didyou callintobeing this pitofred-hot embers 1" "Yes, Idid."
[233]"Why 1""To stopyoufrom alms-giving andtodestroy the life
ofthatPacceka Buddha." "Iwillnotpermit youeither tostopmefrom
myalms-giving ortodestroy thelifeofthePacceka Buddha. Iamgoing
toseeto-day whether your strength ormine isthegreater." And still
standing onthebrink ofthat fiery pit,hecried, "Keverend Pacceka
Buddha, eventhough Ibeinacttofallheadlong into thispitofred-hot
embers, Iwillnot tui-n back. Only vouchsafe totake thefood Ibring."
And sosaying herepeated thisstanza:—
Farrather will Iheadlong plunge amain
Full inthisgulf ofhell,than stoop toshame I
Vouchsafe, sir,atmyhands totake thisalms!
With these words theBodhisatta, grasping thebowl offood, strode on
withundaunted resolution right ontothesurface ofthepitoffire. But

hisbowl aloft intotheheavens, andright inthesight ofalltliepeople he
himself rosebodily iuto theairlikewise, andpassed away totheHimalayas
again, seeming totread atrack formed ofclouds fantastically shaped.
And Mara, too,defeated and dejected, passed away back tohisown
abode.
But theBodhisatti, stillstanding inthe lotus, preached ['234] the
Truth tothepeople, extolling alms-giving andthecommandments ;after
which, girtround bytheescorting multitude, hepassed into hisown

LOSAKA-JATAKA.
"Theheadstrong manP—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about theElder Losaka Tissa.
'Who,' you assk,'was thisElder Losaka Tissa.^'Well; hisfather wasa
tisherman inKosala, andhewasthebane ofhisfamily;and,when aBrother,
never hadanything given tohim. Hisprevious existence ended, hehadbeen
conceived byacertain fisherman's wife inafishing-village ofathousand families

thelikebadfortune dogged themfrom thatdayforward. Also, before hisbirth,
thevillage wasdestroyed seven times by fire,andvisited seven times bythe
king's vengeance. Sointime itcame topassthatthepeople fellintoawretched
plight. Reflecting thatsuchhadnotbeen their lotinformer days, butthatnow
they were going torackand ruin, they concluded that there must besome
breeder ofmisfortune among them, andresolved todivide intotwobands. This
they did;andthere werethentwobauds offivehundred families each. Thence-
forward, ruindogged theband which included theparents ofthefuture Losaka,
whilst theother fivehundred families throve apace. Sotheformer resolved togo
onhalving theirnumbers, anddidso,until thisonefamily wasparted from all
the rest. Then theyknew that thebreeder ofmisfortune was inthat family,
andwithblows drovethem away. [235]With difficulty could hismother geta
livelihood; but,when hertimewascome, shegave birth toherson ina
certain place. (Hethat isborn into hislastexistence cannot bekilled. For
likealamp within ajar, even sosecurely within hisbreast burns theflame ofhis

runabout, andwhen hecould runabout then sheputapotsherd inhishands,

child used tobeghisfoodthereabouts andsleep where hecould. Hewasun-

flungaway therinsings oftherice-pots.
Sariputta, Captain oftheFaith, going intoSavatthi onhisround foralms,
noticed thechild, and,wondering what village thehapless creature came from,
was filled with love forhimand called out"Come here." The child came,
bowed totheElder, andstood before him. Then saidSariputta, "What village
doyoubelong to,andwhere areyour parents.'"
"Iamdestitute, sir,"' saidthechild; "formyparents saidtheywere tired
out,andsoforsook me,andwent away."
"Would you like tobecome aBrotherT'"Indeed Ishould, sir;butwho

'Losaka Tissa willpassaway to-day;andto-day atanyrate Iwillseethathe

because Losaka waswith him, itwas allinvain that Sariputta held outhis

Sohebade theElder gobackandseathimself inthesitting- halloftheMonastery,
andcollected foodwhich hesentwithamessage [236] that itwastobegiven to

forgetting allabout Losaka, ate itthemselves. Sowhen Sariputta rose up,and
wasentering themonastery, Losaka came tohimandsaluted him. Sariputta
stopped, andturning round said, "Well, didyougetthefood, brother?"
"Ishall, nodoubt, get itingood time," said theElder. Sariputta was
greatly troubled, andlooked toseewhat hour itwas. Butnoon waspassed i.
"Stay here, Brother," saidSariputta; "and donotmove"; andhemade Losaka
Tissa sitdown inthe sitting-hal), and setout forthepalace oftheking of

sweet kinds offood-. With thishereturned, andstood before him,bowl in

hewanted andwas satisfied, andthat selfsame daypassed away bythatdeath
whereby existence ceases forever.
TheAll-Enlightened Buddha stood by,andsawthebodyburned ;andthey
built ashrine forthecollected ashes.
Seated inconclave intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren said, "Brethren,
Losaka wasunlucky, and little wasgiven tohim.Howcame hewith his
unluck andhisneediness towintheglory ofArahabshipT'
Entering theHall, theMaster asked what theywere talking about ;andthey
toldhim. "Brethren," said he,"this Brother's own actions were thecause both
ofhisreceiving solittle, andofhisbecoming anArahat. Inbygone dayshehad
prevented others from receiving, andthat iswhyhereceived solittle himself.
But itwasbyhismeditating onsorrow, transitoriness, andtheabsence ofan
abiding principle inthings, that hewonArahatship forhimself." And so
saying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once iijjon atime, inthedays oftheBuddha Kassapa, there wasa
Brother who lived thevillage lifeandwasmaintained byacountry squire.

thisBrother. Sopleased wasthesquire [237] with theverydemeanour of
theEkler that, taking hisbowl, heledhimintothehouse andwith every
mark ofrespect invited him toeat.Then helistened toashort discourse
bytheElder, andatitsclose said, with abow, "Sir, praydonotjourney
further than ourmonastery close by;intheevening Iwillcome and call
uponyouthere." SotheElder went tothemonastery, saluting theresident
Brother onhisentrance ;and, firstcourteously asking leave, took aseatby
hisside.TheBrother received himwith allfriendliness, andasked whether
anyfoodhadbeen given him asalms.
"Oh yes," replied theElder. "Where, pray?" "Why, inyour village
close by,atthesquire's house." And sosaying, theElder asked tobe
shewn hiscellandmade itready. Then laying aside hisbowland robe,
andseating himself, hebecame absorbed inblissful Insight andenjoyed
thebliss oftheFruits ofthePaths.
Intheevening came thesquire, with servants carrying flowers and
perfumes and lamjjs and oil. Saluting theresident Brother, heasked
whether aguest hadappeared, anElder. Being told that hehad, the
squire asked where hewasandlearned which cellhadbeen given him.
Then thesquire went totheElder and, fii'stbowing courteously, seated
himself bytheElder's sideandlistened toadiscourse. Inthecool oftiie
evening thesquire made hisofferings attheTope andBo-Tree, lithis
lamp, anddeparted withaninvitation toboth Elder andBrother tocome
uptohishouse nextdayfortheir meal.
"I'm lo.singmyholdonthesquire," thought theBrother. "Ifthis
Elder stops, Ishall count fornothiug with him." Sohewasdiscontented
and fella-scheming how tomake theElder seethathemust not settle
down there forgood. Accordingly, when theElder came topay his
respects intheearly morning, theBrother didnotopen his lips. The
Arahat read the other's thoughts and said tohimself, "This Brother
knows notthat Ishall never stand inhislight either with thefamily that
supports himorwith hisBrotherhood." And going back tohis cell,he
became absorbed inthebliss ofInsight andinthebliss oftheFruits.
Next day,theresident Brother, having firstknocked gingerly onthe
gong', andhaving tapped onthegong with theback ofhisnail,went off
alone tothesquire's house. Taking fromhim hisalms-bowl, thesquire
badehimbeseated andasked where thestranger was.
"Iknow nonews ofyour friend," said theBrother. "Though I
knocked onthegongandtapped athisdoor, Icouldn't wake him. Ican

commend themselves toyou."
(Meantime theArahat, whohadwaited tillthetimecame togohis
round foralms, hadwashed anddressed andrisen withbowlandrobe in
theairandgone elsewhere.)
Thesquire gave theBrother riceandmilk toeat,withgheeandsugar
andhoney in it.Then hehad hisbowl scoured withperfumed chunam
powder and filled afresh, saying, "Sir,theElder must befatigued with
hisjourney; takehim this." Without demur theBrother took thefood
andwent hisway, thinking tohimself, "Ifourfriend once getsataste of
this, taking himbythethroat andkicking himoutofdoors won't getrid
ofhim. Buthow canIgetridofit? IfIgive itaway toahuman
being, itwillbeknown. IfIthrow itintothewater, theghee will float
ontop.And asforthrowing itaway ontheground, that willonlybring
allthecrows ofthedistrict flocking tothe s])ot." Inhisperplexity his
eye fellonafield thathadbeen fired, and, scraping outtheembers, he
flung thecontents ofhisbowl intothehole, filled intheembers onthe
top,andwent off"home. Notfinding theElder there, hethought thatthe
Arahat hadunderstood hisjealousy anddeparted. "Woe isme," he
cried, "formygreed hasmademetosin."
And thenceforth sore aflliction befell himandhebecame like aliving
ghost. Dying soon aftei-, hewasre-born inhellandtherewastormented
forhundreds ofthousands ofyears. Byreason ofhisripening sin,infive
hundred successive births hewasanogreandnever hadenough toeat,
except onedaywhen heenjoyed asurfeit ofoff"al. Next, forfivehundred
more existences hewasadog,andhere too,onlyononesingle dayhadhis
fill—ofavomit ofrice;onnoother occasion didhehaveenough toeat.
Evenwhen heceased tobeadog,hewasonlyborn intoabeggar family
inaKasi village. Fi-om thehour ofhisbirth, that family became still
more beggared, andhenever gothalf asmuch water-gruel ashewanted.
Andhewascalled Mitta-vindaka [239].
Unable atlasttoendure thepangs ofhunger' thatnowbeset them, his
father andmother beathimanddrove himaway, crying, "Begone, you
curse!"
Inthecourse ofhiswanderings, thelittle outcast came toBenares, where
inthose days theBodhisatta wasateacher ofworld-wide fame with five
hundred young Brahmins toteach. Inthose times theBenares folkused to

satta. Buthewas fierce andintractable, always fighting with hisfellows

andheedless ofhismaster's reproofs ;andsotheBodhisatta's fees fell off.
And ashequarrelled so,andwould notlirook reproof, theyouth ended by
running away, andcame toaborder-village where hehired himself outfor
aliving, andmarried amiserably poorwoman bywhom hehadtwo chil-
dren. Later, thevillagers paidhim toteach themwhatwastruedoctrine
andwhatwas false, andgavehimahuttoliveinattheentrance totheir
village. But, allbecause ofMitta-vindaka's coming toliveamong them,
theking's vengeance fellseven times onthose villagers, andseven times
were theirhomes burned totheground ;seven times toodidtheir water-
tankdryup.
Then they considered thematter andagreed that itwasnotsowith
them before Mitta-vindaka's coming, butthatever since hecame theyhad
been going frombad toworse. Sowithblows theydrove himfrom their
village ;andforth hewent with hisfamily, andcame toahaunted forest.
And there thedemons killed and atehiswifeand children. Fleeing
thence, hecame aftermany wanderings toavillage onthecoast called
Gambhira, amving onadaywhen ashipwasputting tosea;andhe
hired himself forservice aboard. Foraweek theship heldonherway,

theygavehimaraftofbamboos, andlaying hold ofhim, casthim over-
board. And forthwith theshipmadewayagain [240].
Mitta-vindaka clambered ontohisbamboos andfloated onthewaves.
Thanks tohishaving obeyed thecommandments inthetimes ofthe
Buddha Kassapa, hefound inmid-ocean fourdaughters ofthegods dwell-
inginapalace ofcrystal, withwhom hedwelt happily forseven days.
Now palace-ghosts enjoy happiness only forseven days atatime;and
so,when theseventh daycame andtheyhad todepart totheir j)unish-
ment, they lefthimwith aninjixnction toawait their return. Butno
sooner were they departed, thanMitta-vindaka putoffonhisraftagain
andcame towhere eight daughters ofthegods dwelt inapalace ofsilver.
Leaving them inturn, hecame towhere sixteen daughters ofthegods
dwelt inapalace ofjewels, andthereafter towhere thirty-two dwelt ina
palace ofgold. Paying noregard totheir words, again hesailedaway and
came toacityofogres, setamong islands. And there anogress wasrang-
ingabout intheshape ofagoat. Notknowing thatshewasanogress,
Mitta-vindaka thought tomake ameal offthegoat,andseized hold ofthe
creature bythe leg. Straightway, byvirtue ofherdemon-nature, she
hurled himupandaway over theocean, andplump hefellinathorn-
brake ontheslopes ofthedrymoat ofBenares, andthence rolled to
earth.
Now itchanced that atthattime thieves used tofi-equent thatmoat

and killtheKing's goats ;andthegoatherds hadhidden themselves hard
bytocatch therascals.
Mitta-vindaka picked himself upandsawthegoats. Thought heto
himself,"Well, itwasagoat inanisland intheocean that, being seized
bytheleg,hurled mehereover seas. Perhaps, ifIdothesamebyoneof
these goats, Imay gethurled back again towhere thedaughters ofthe
gods dwell intheir ocean palaces." So,without thinking, heseized oneof
thegoats bythe leg.Atonce thegoatbegan tobleat, andthegoatherds
came running upfrom every side. They laidhold ofhimatonce, crying,
"This isthethief thathassolong livedontheKing's goats." And they
beathimandbegan tohaulhimaway inbonds totheKing.
Just atthattime theBodhisatta, with hisfivehundred young Brah-
minsround him,wascoming outofthecitytobathe. Seeing andrecog-
nising Mitta-vindaka, hesaid tothegoatherds, "Why, this isapupil of
mine,mygoodmen; what haveyouseized himfor?" "Master," saidthey,
"wecaiight this thief intheactofseizing agoatbythe leg,and that's
why we've gothold ofhim." "Well," [241] saidtheBodhisatta, "sup-
poseyouhandhimover toustolivewith usasourslave." "All right,
sir," replied themen,and letting their prisoner go,theywent their way.
Then theBodhisatta asked Mitta-vindaka where hehadbeen allthatlong
time; andMitta-vindaka toldhim allthathehaddone.
"'Tisthi'ough nothearkening tothosewhowished him well," said
theBodhisatta, "that hehassuffered allthese misfortunes." And Ik;
recited thisstanza:—

Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give.

When bythelegheseized thegrazing goat.
And inthose times both thatTeacher andMitta-vindaka passed away,
andtheir after-lot wasaccordinf; totheir deeds.

andofhisgetting Arahatship." Hislesson ended, heshewed theconnexion and

about acertain greedy Brother. Hisgreediness willberelated intheNinth
Book intheKaka- Jataka i.
Butonthisoccasion theBrethren toldtheMaster, saying, "Sir, thisBrother

SaidtheMaster, "Is ittrue [242] asthey say,Brother, thatyouaregreedy?"
"Yes, sir,"wasthereply.
"So tooinbygone days, Brother, youwere greedy, andbyreason ofyour
greediness lostyour life ;alsoyoucaused thewiseandgood tolosetheirhome."
And sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodlii-
sattawasborn apigeon. Now theBenares folkofthose days, asanactof
goodness, used tohangupstraw-baskets indivers places fortheshelter
andcomfort ofthebirds; andthecook oftheLordHigh Treasurer of
Benares hung uponeofthese baskets inhiskitchen. Inthisbasket the
Bodhisatta tookuphisabode, sallying outatdaybreak iuquest offood,
andreturning home intheevening; andsohelived his life.
Butonedayacrow, flying over thekitchen, snuffed upthegoodly
savour from thesaltandfresh fishandmeat there, andwas filled with
longing totaste it.Casting about how tohave hiswill,heperched hai'd
by,andatevening sawtheBodhisatta comehome andgointothekitchen.
"Ah !"thought he,"Icanmanage itthrough thej)igeon."
Sobackhecame nextdayatdawn, and,when theBodhisatta sallied
outinquest offood, kept following himabout from place toplace like his
shadow. SotheBodhisatta said, "Why doyoukeepwithme,friend?"
"My lord," answered thecrow, "your demeanour haswonmyadmira-
tion; andhenceforth itismywish tofollow you." "But your kind of
foodandmine, friend, isnotthesame," said theBodhisatta; "you will
behard put toitifyouattach yourself tome." "Mylord," saidthe
crow, "when youareseeking your food, Iwillfeed too,byyour side."
"Sobeit,then," saidtheBodhisatta; "only yonmust beearnest." And
with thisadmonition tothecrow, theBodhisatta ranged about pecking up
grass-seeds; whilst theother went about turning overcowdung andpick-

totheBodhisatta andremarked, "My lord,yougive toomuch time to

Andwhen theBodhisatta hadfedandreached home again atevening,
inflewthecrow withhimintothekitchen [243].
"Why, ourbirdhasbrought another home withhim;" exclaimed the
cook,andhungupasecond basket forthecrow. Andfrom thattime on-
ward thetwobirds dwelt together inthekitchen.
Now onedaytheLordHigh Treasurer hadinastore offishwhich the
cookhung upabout thekitchen. Filled with greedy longing atthesight,
thecrowmade uphismind tostay athome next dayand treat himself to
thisexcellent fare.
Soallthenight longhelaygroaning away;andnext day,when the
Bodhisatta wasstarting insearch offood,and cried, ''Come along, friend
crow," thecrow replied, "Gowithout me,mylord; forIhave apain inmy
stomach." "Friend," answered theBodhisatta, "Inever heard ofcrows
having pains intheir stomachs before. True, crows feelfaint ineach of
thethree night-watches; but ifthey eatalamp-wick, their hunger is
appeased forthemomenta Youmust behankering after the fishinthe
kitchen here. Come now, man's food willnotagree with you.Donot
giveway like this, butcome andseekyour foodwith me." "Indeed, I
amnot able,mylord," said thecrow. "Well, yourownconduct will
shew," said theBodhisatta. "Only fallnotaprey togreed, butstand
steadfast." And with thisexhortation, away heflew tofindhisdaily food.
Thecook took several kinds offish,anddressed some oneway,some
another. Then lifting thelids oft'hissaucepans alittle toletthesteam

hestood wiping thesweat from hisbrow. Just atthatmoment out
popped thecrow's headfrom thebasket. Aglance toldhimthatthecook

Atevening theBodhisatta came back, andsawthewretched plight of
thecrow. "Ah! greedy crow," heexclaimed, "you would notheedmy
words, andnowyourowngreed hasworked youwoe." Sosaying, he
repeated thisstanza :—
Theheadstrong man who,when exhorted, pays
Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give,
Shall surely perish, likethegreedy crow.
Who laughed toscorn thepigeon's warning words.
Then, exclaiming "Itoocannolonger dwell here," theBodhisatta
flewaway. Butthecrow died there andthen, andthecook flung him,

SaidtheMaster, "You were greedy, Brother, inbygone times, justasyouare
now;and allbecause ofyour greediness thewiseandgood ofthose dayshadto
abandon their homes." Having ended thislesson, theMaster preached theFour
Truths, attheclose whereof thatBrother won theFruit oftheSecond Path.
Then theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth asfollows:—
"The greedy Brother wasthecrow ofthose times, and Ithepigeon."

''The headstrong »»«>!-."- -This story was toldbytheMaster while atJeta-

whether thereport wastrue thathewasheadstrong, andtheBrother admitted
that itwas. "Brother," saidtheMaster, "this isnotthe firsttimeyouhavebeen
headstrong: youwere just asheadstrong informer days also, [245] and, asthe
result ofyour headstrong refusal tofollow theadvice ofthewiseandgood,you
metyourendbythebiteofasnake." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoawealthy family intheKingdom ofKasi.
Having come toyears ofdiscretion, hesawhowfrom passion springs pain
andhowtrue blisscomes bytheabandonment ofpassion. Soheputlusts
from him,andgoing forth totheHimalayas became ahermit, winning by
fulfilment oftheordained mystic meditations the five orders ofthe

Higher Knowledge and theeight Attainments, And ashelived his
lifeintherapture ofInsight, hecame inafter times tohave alarge
following offivehundred hermits, whose teacher hewas.
Now onedayayoung poisonous viper, wandering about asvipers do,
came tothehutofoneofthehermits ;andthatBrother grew asfond
ofthecreatiTre asifitwere hisown child, housing itinajoint ofhamboo
andshewing kindness toit.And because itwaslodged inajoint of
bamboo, theviper wasknown bythename of"Bamboo." Moreover,
because thehermit was asfond oftheviper asifitwere hisown child,
they called him"Bamljoo's Father."
Hearing thatoneoftheBrethren waskeeping aviper, theBodhisatta
sent forthatBrother andasked whether thereport was true.When
toldthat itwastrue, theBodhisatta said,"Aviper cannever betrusted;
keep itnolonger."
"But," urged theBrother, "my viper isdear tomeasapupil to
ateacher;—Icould notlivewithout him." "Well then," answered the
Bodhisatta, "know that thisvery snake will loseyouyour life." But
heedless ofthemaster's warning, thatBrother stillkept thepethecould
notbear topart with. Only avery fewdays later alltheBrethren
went outtogather fruits, andcoming toas})otwhere allkinds grew
inplenty, they stayed there two orthree days. With them went
"Bamboo's Father," leaving hisviper behind initsbamboo prison. Two
orthree days afterwards, when hecame back, hebethought himoffeeding
thecreature, and,opening thecane, stretched outhishand, saying, "Come,
myson;youmust behungry." Butangry with itslong fast,theviper
bithisoutstretched hand, killing himonthespot,andmade itsescape into
theforest.
Seeing himlying there dead, theBrethren came and toldtheBodhi-
satta [246], whobade thebody beburned. Then, seated intheir midst, he
exhorted theBrethren byrepeating thisstanza:—
Theheadstrong man, who,when exhorted, pays
Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give,—
Like'Bamboo's father,' shall bebrought tonought.
Thus didtheBodhisatta exhort hisfollowers; andhedeveloped
within himself thefourNoble States, and athisdeath wasre-born into
theBrahma Realm.
SaidtheMaster, "Brother, this isnotthefirsttimeyouhaveshewn yourself
headstrong
;youwerenolessheadstrong intimes gone by,andthereby metyour
death from aviper's bite." Having ended hislesson, theMaster shewed the
connexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "In tho.se days, thisheadstrong
Brother was'Bamboo's Father,' mydisciples were theband ofdisciples, and I
myself their teacher."

"Sense-lacl'ing friends."—This story was toldbytheMaster whilst onan
alms-pilgrimage inMagadha, about some stupid villagers inacertain hamlet.
Tradition says that, after travelling from Savatthi tothekingdom ofMagadha,
hewasonhisround inthatkingdom when hearrived atacertain hamlet, which
wasthronged with fools. Inthishamlet these foolsmettogether oneday,and
debated together, saying, "Friends, whenweareatwork inthejungle, the
mosquitos devour us;andthat hinders ourwork. Let us,arming ourselves
withbowsandweapons, gotowarwith themosquitos andshoot orhewthem all
todeath." So oft"tothejungle they went, and shouting, "Shoot down the
mosquitos," shotandstruck oneanother, tillthey were inasadstate and
returned only tosinkontheground inorwithin thevillage oratitsentrance.
Surrounded bytheOrder oftheBrethren, theMaster came inquest ofalms
tothat village. The sensible minority among theinhabitants nosooner saw
theBlessed One,than they erected apavilion attheentrance totheir village
and, after bestowing largealmsonthe[247] Brotherhood with theBuddha atits
head, bowed totheMaster andseated themselves. Observing wounded men
lying around onthis sideandonthat, theMaster asked those lay-brothers,
saying, "There arenumbers ofdisabled menabout ;what hashappened to
them?" "Sir," wasthereply, "they went forth towarwith themosquitos, but
only shotoneanother andsodisabled themselves." Said theMaster, "This is
notthe firsttime that these foolish people have dealt outblows tothem.selves
instead oftothemosquitos theymeant tokill ;informer times, also, there were
those who,meaning tohitamosquito, hitafellow-creatm-e instead." And so
saying, atthose villagers' request hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta gained hislivelihood asatrader. Inthose days inaborder-
village inKasi there dwelt anumber ofcarpenters. And itchanced that
one ofthem, abald grey-haired man, was ]»laning away atsome wood,
with hishead glistening like acopper bowl,when amosquito settled
onhisscalpandstung himwith itsdart-like sting.
Said thecarpenter tohisson,whowasseated hard by,—"My boy,
there's amosquito stinging meonthehead; dodrive itaway." "Hold
stillthen, father," saidtheson;"oneblow will settle it."
(Atthatverytime theBodhisatta hadreached that village intheway
oftrade, andwassitting inthecarpenter's shop.)
"Ridmeofit,"cried thefather. "All right, fivther," answered the
son,whowasbehind theoldman's back, and, raising asharp axeonhigh
with intent tokillonly themosquito, hecleft— hisfather's head intwain.
Sotheoldman felldeadonthespot.
Thought theBodhisatta, whohadbeenaneye-witness ofthewhole
scene,—"Better than such afriend isanenemy with sense,whom fear

lines:—
Sense-lacking friends areworse than foeswith sense;
Witness thesonthatsought thegnat toslay,
But cleft, poor fool, hisfather's skull intwain. [248]
Sosaying, theBodhisatta roseupanddeparted, passing away inafter
days tofareaccording tohisdeserts. And asforthecarpenter, hisbody
wasburned byhiskinsfolk.
"Thus, laybrethren," saidtheMaster, "inbygone times alsotherewere those
who, seeking tohitamosquito, struck down afellow-creatiu'e." This lesson
ended, heshewed theconnexion and identitied theBirth bysaying, "Inthose
days Iwasmyself thewiseandgood trader whodeparted after repeating the

Tradition says that, inthecourse ofanalms-journey among the\)eople of
Kosala, theMaster came toacertain hamlet. Asquire oftheplace invited the
Buddha totake themid-day meal athishouse, andhadhisguest seated inthe
pleasaunce, where heshewed hospitality totheBrotherhood with theBuddha at
itshead, andcourteously gavethem leave tostroll atwillabout hisgrounds. So
theBrethren rose u[)andwalked about thegrounds with thegardener. Ob-
serving intheir walk abare space, they said tothegardener, "Lay-disciple,
elsewhere inthepleasaiuice there isabundant shade ;buthere there's neither
treenorshrub. Howcomes this?"
"Sirs," replied theman,•'when these grounds were being laidout,avillage
lad,whowasdoing thewatering, pulled upalltheyoung trees hereabouts and
then gavethemmuch orlittle [250] water according tothesizeoftheir roots.
Sotheyoung trees withered anddied oft';andthat iswhy thisspace isbare."
Drawing near totheMaster, theBrethren toldhim this. "Yes, Brethren,"
.said he,"this isnotthe firsttime that village ladhasspoiled apleasaunce; he
didprecisely thesame inbygone times also." And sosaying, hetold thisstory

Now inthose clays, atribe ofmonkeys was living intheking's
pleasaunce; andtheking's gardener thought tohimself, "They 'reholiday-
making upinthe city. I'llgetthemonkeys todothewatering for
me,andbeofi'toenjoy myself with therest." Sosaying, hewent tothe
king ofthemonkeys, and, firstdwelling onthebenefits hismajesty and
hissubjects enjoyed from residence inthepleasaunce intheway offlowers
and fruit andyoung shoots toeat,ended bysaying, "To-day there's
holiday-making upinthecity,andI'm ofi'toenjoy myself. Couldn't you
water theyoung trees while I'maway?"
"Oh! yes," saidthemonkey.
"Only mind you do," said thegardener; and offhewent, giving the
monkeys thewater-skins andwooden watering-pots todothework
with.
Then themonkeys took thewater-skins andwatering-pots, and fellto
watering theyoung trees. "Butwemustmind nottowaste thewater,"
observed their king; "asyouwater, first pulleachyoung treeupand
look atthesizeofitsroots. Then give plenty ofwater tothose whose
roots strike deej), butonly alittle tothose with tiny roots. When tliis

"Tobesure," saidtheother monkeys, anddidashebadethem.
Atthisjuncture acei'tain wiseman, seeing themonkeys thusengaged,
asked themwhythey pulled uptree after treeandwatered them according
tothesizeoftheir roots.
"Because such areourking's commands," answered themonkeys.
Their replymoved thewiseman toreflect how, with every desire

'Tisknowledge crowns endeavour with success.
For fools arethwarted bytheir foolislmess,—Witness theapethat killed thegarden trees.

VEDABBHA-JATAKA.
''MisgvAded effort."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about aself-willed Brother. Said theMaster tothat Brother, "This isnotthe
first time. Brother, thatyouhave been self-willed
;youwere ofjust thesame
disposition inbygone tunes also [253];andtherefore itwas that, asyouwould
notfollow theadvice ofthewiseandgood,youcame tobecutintwobyasharp
sword andwere flung onthehighway ;andyouwere the S(jlecausewhya
thousand menmettheir end." A.ndsosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Oncf onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBeuares, there
wasabrahmin inavillage whoknew thecharm called Vedabbha. Now
thischarm, sothey say,was precious beyond allprice. For, ifata
certain conjunction oftheplanets thecharm wasrepeated andthegaze
bentupwards totheskies, straightway from theheavens there rained the
Seven Things ofPrice,—gold, silver, pearl, coral, catseye, ruby, and
diamond.
Inthose days theBodhisatta wasapupil ofthisbrahmin ;andone
day hismaster leftthe village onsome business orother, andcame
with theBodhisatta tothecountry ofCeti.
Inaforest bythewaydwelt fivehundred robbers—known as"theDe-
spatchei's"—whomade thewayimpassable. And these caught theBodhi-
satta andtheVedabbha-brahmin. (Why, you ask,were they called the
Despatchers'? —Well, thestory goes that ofevery two prisoners they
made they used todespatch one tofetch theransom ;and that'swhy
theywere called theDespatchers. Iftheycaptured afather andason,
they toldthefather togofortheransom tofree hisson ;iftheycaught a
mother andherdaughter, they sent themother forthemoney; ifthey
caught two bi'others, they lettheelder go ;and sotoo, ifthey caught
ateaclier and hispupil, itwas thepupil they setfree. Inthis case,
therefore, they kept theVedabbha-brahmin, andsent theBodhisatta for

theransom.) And theBodhisatta saidwith abow tohismaster, "In
adayortwo Isliall surely come back]have nofear ;only failnotto
doasTshall say. To-day willcome topass theconjunction ofthe
planets which brings about therain oftheThings ofPrice. Take heed
lest, yielding tothismishap, you repeat thecharm and calldown the
precious shower. For, ifyou do,calamity will certainly befall bothyou
andthisband ofrobbers." With thiswarning tohismaster, theBodhi-
sattawent hisway inquest oftheransom.
Atsunset therobbers bound thebrahmin and laidhimbytheheels.
Just atthismoment the fullmoon roseover theeastern horizon, and
thebrahmin, studying theheavens, knew [254] thatthegreat conjunction
wastaking place. "Why," thought he,"should Isuffer thismisery?
Byrepeating thecharm Iwill calldown theprecious rain, paythe
robbers theransom, andgofree." Sohecalled out totherobbers,
"Friends, whydoyoutakemeaprisoner?" "To getaransom, reverend
sir," said they. "Well, ifthat isallyouwant," saidthebrahmin, "make
haste anduntieme;havemyhead bathed, andnew clothes putonme;
and letmebeperfumed anddecked with flowers. Then leavemeto
myself." Therobbers didashebade them. And thebrahmin, marking
theconjunction oftheplanets, repeated hischarm with eyes uplifted
totheheavens. Forthwith theThings ofPrice poinded down from the
skies !Therobbers picked them allup,wrapping their booty intobundles
with their cloaks. Then with their brethren theymarched away; and
thebrahmin followed intherear. But, asluckwould have it,theparty
wascaptured byasecond band offivehundred robbers! "Why doyou
seize us?" saidthe first tothesecond band. "For booty," wastheanswer.
"Ifbooty iswhat youwant, seizeonthatbrahmin, whobysimply gazing
upattheskies brought down riches asrain. Itwashewhogave usall
thatwehave got." Sothesecond band ofrobbers letthe firstband go,
and seized onthebrahmin, crying, "Give usriches too!" "Itwould
givemegreat pleasure," saidthebrahmin; "but itwillbeayear before
therequisite conjunction oftheplanets takes place again. Ifyou will
only besogood astowait tillthen, Iwillinvoke theprecious shower for
you."
"Rascally brahmin!" cried theangiy robbers, "youmade theother
band rich ofi"-hand, butwant xistowait awhole year !"Andthey cuthim
intwowith asharp sword, andflung hisbody inthemiddle oftheroad.
Then hurrying after the firstband ofI'obbers, they killed everyman of
them tooinhand-to-hand fight, andseized thebooty. Next, they divided
intotwocompanies andfought among themselves, company against com-
pany, tilltwohundred and fiftymenwere slain. And sotheywent on
killing oneanother, tillonlytwowere leftalive. Thus didthose thousand
mencome todestruction.

Now,when thetwo sui'vivors hadmanaged tocarry offthetreasure
they hid itinthejungle near avillage ;andoneofthem satthere, sword
inhand, [255] toguard it,whilst theother went intothevillage toget
riceandhave itcooked forsupper.
"Covetousness istheroot ofruin!" mused he'thatstopped bythe
treasure. "Wheiimymatecomes back, he'llwant halfofthis. Suppose
Ikillhimthemoment hegets back." Sohedrew hissword and sat
waiting forhiscomrade's return.
Meanwhile, theother hadequally reflected that thebooty had tobe
halved, andthought tohimself, "Suppose Ipoison the rice,andgive it
him toeatand sokillhim, andhave thewhole ofthetreasure to
myself." Accordingly, when thericewasboiled, hefirst atehisown share,
andthen put ])oison inthe rest, Avhich hecarried back withhimtothe
jungle. But scarce hadheset itdown, when the otlier robber cuthim
intwowith hissword, and hidthebodyaway inasecluded spot.
Then heatethepoisoned rice,and died thenand thei^e. Thus, by
reason ofthetreasure, notonly thebrahmin but alltherobbers came to
destruction.
Howbeit, after adayortwotheBodhisatta came backwith theransom.
Notfinding hismaster where hehad lefthim,butseeing treasure strewn
allround about, hisheart misgave him that, inspite ofhisadvice, his
master must have called down ashower oftreasure from theskies, and
that allmust have perished inconsequence;andheproceeded along the
road. Onhiswayhecame towhere hismaster's body laycloven intwain
upon theway. "Alas !"hecried, "heisdead tlu'ough notheeding my
warning." Then with gathered sticks hemade apyre andburnt his
master's body,making anoffering ofwild flowers. Further along theroad,
hecame upon thefivehundred "Despatchers," andfurther stillupon the
twohundred and fifty,andsoonbydegrees until atlasthecame towhere
layonlytwo corpses. Marking how ofthethousand allbuttwohad
perished, andfeeling surethattheremust betwosurvivors, andthatthese
could notrefrain from strife, hepressed ontoseewhere theyhadgone. So
onhewent tillhefound thepathbywhich with thetreasure theyhad
turned intothejungle;andthere hefound theheap ofbundles oftreasure,
andonerobber lying dead with hisrice-bowl overturned athis side.
Realising thewhole story ataglance, theBodhisatta sethimself tosearch
forthemissing man,andatlastfoimd hisbody inthesecret spotwhere it
hadbeen flung [256]."And thus," mused theBodhisatta, "through not
following mycounsel mymaster inhisself-will hasbeen themeans of

asmymaster." Andhei-epeated thisstanza:—
Misguided effort leads toloss, notgain;
Thieves killed Vedabbha andthemselves were slain.
Thus spake theBodhisatta, andhewentontosay,—"Andeven asmy
master's misguided andmisplaced effort incausing therain oftreasure
tofallfrom heaven wrought both hisowndeath andthedestruction of
others with him.even soshall every othermanwhobymistaken means
seeks tocompass hisown advantage, utterly perish andinvolve others in
hisdestruction." With these words didtheBodhisatta make theforest
ring ;and inthisstanza didhepreach theTruth, whilst theTree-fairies
shouted applause. Thetreasure hecontrived tocarry offtohisownhome,
where helived outhisterm oflifeintheexercise ofalmsgiving andother
good works. Andwhen hislifeclosed, hedeparted totheheaven hehad
won.
Said theMaster, "This isnotthe first time. Brother, youwere self-willed;
youwere self-willed inbygone times aswell ;andbyyour selfwill youcame
toutter destruction." His lesson ended, heidentified theBirth bysaying,
"The selfwilled Brother wastheVedabbha-brahmin ofthose days,and Imyself

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, some
townsfolk hadasked acountry-girl inmarriage and liadnamed tlieday.
Having already made thearrangement, they asked their family ascetic
whether the .starswere propitious fortheceremony onthatday. Piqued
attheir having fixed thedaytosuitthemselves without firsttaking counsel
with him, theascetic madeuphismind tothwart their marriage festivities
forthatday; [2.58] andaccordingly hemade answer that thestarswere
notfavourable forthat day,and that, ifthey persisted, grave misfortune
would betheresult. So,intheir faith intheascetic, they stayed athome!
When thecountry folkfound thatthetown party didnotcome, they said
among themselves, "Itwastheywho fixed themarriage forto-day, and
nowtheyhave notcome. Who arethey, forsooth 1"Andtheymarried
the gii'ltosomeone else.
Next daythetownsfolk came andasked forthegirl ;butthe}' ofthe
country made thisanswer:—"You town-people lackcommon decency.
Youyourselves named thedayandyetdidnotcome tofetch thebride.
Asyoustopped away, wemarried hertosomeone else." "Butweasked
our ascetic, andhetold usthestarswere unfavourable. That's whywe
didnotcome yesterday. Give usthe girl." "You didn't come atthe
proper time,andnow she's another's. How canwemarry hertwice over?"
Whilst theywrangled thuswith oneanother, awisemanfrom thetown
came intothecountry onbusiness. Hearing thetownsfolk explain that
theyhadconsulted their ascetic andthat their absence wasdue tothe
unfavourable disposition ofthestars, heexclaimed, "What, forsooth, do

thestars matter? Isnotthelucky thing togetthegirl?" And, so
saying, herepeated thisstanza:—
The foolmaywatch for'lucky days,'
Yetluck shall always miss;
'Tisluck itself isluck's own star.
What canmere stars achieve ?

ascetic hasthwarted that family's festivities ;hedidjustthesame thing in

"Jthousand evil-doers."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJeta-

Book intheMahil-Kanha-jataka^
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasreborn inthewomb oftheQueen Consort. When hewas
born, hewasnamed Prince Brahmadatta onhisname-day. Bysixteen
years ofagehehadbeen welleducated atTakkasila, hadlearned theThree
Vedas byheart, andwasversed intheEighteen Branches ofKnowledge.
And hisfather madehimaViceroy.
Now inthose days theBenares folkweremuch given tofestivals to

carcasses. Thought thedestined Lord ofMercy tohimself, "Ledastray
bysuperstition, mennowwantonly sacrifice life;themultitude arefor
themost part given uptoirreligion :butwhen atmyfather's death I
succeed tomyinheritance, Iwill findmeans toendsuch destruction
oflife. Iwill devise some clever stratagem whereby the evil shall be
stopped without harming asinglehuman being." Inthismood theprince
onedaymounted hischariot anddrove outofthe city.Onthewayhe
sawacrowd gathered together ataholy banyan-tree, praying tothefairy
whohadbeen i-eboi-n inthat tree, togrant them sonsanddaughters,
honour andwealth, each according tohisheart's desire. Alighting from
hischariot theBodhisatta drew near tothetreeandbehaved asawor-
shipper sofarastomake offerings ofperfumes andflowers, sprinkling the
treewith water, andpacing reverently round itstrunk. Then mounting
hischariot again, hewent hiswayback intothecity.
Thenceforth theprince made likejourneys from time totime tothe
tree [260], andworshipped itlikeatrue believer in'gods.'
Induecourse, when hisfather died, theBodhisatta ruled inhisstead.
Shunning thefour evil courses, and practising thetenroyal virtues, he
ruled hispeople inrighteousness. Andnow that hisdesire hadcome to
passandhewas king, theBodhisatta sethimself tofulfil hisformer
resolve. Sohecalled together hisministers, thebrahmins, thegentry, and
theother orders ofthepeople, andasked theassembly whether theyknew
howhehadmade himself king. Butnomancould tell.
"Have youever seenmereverently worshipping abanyan-tree with
perfumes andthelike,andbowing down before if?"
"Sire,wehave," saidthey.
"Well, Iwasmaking avow ;andthevowwas that, ifever Ibecame
king, Iwould offer asacrifice tothat tree.Andnowthatbyhelp ofthe
god Ihave come tobeking, Iwill offermypromised sacrifice. So
prepare itwith allspeed."
"But what arewetomake itof1"
"Myvow," saidtheking, "was this:—Allsuch asareaddicted tothe

aswalk intheTenPaths ofUnrighteousness, them willIslay,andwith

Obedient totlieking's commands, theministers hadproclamation made
bybeat ofdrum accordingly throughout thelength andbreadth ofBenares.
Such wasthe effect oftheproclamation onthetownsfolk thatnotasoul
persisted intheoldwickedness. And throughout theBodliisatta's reign
notamanwasconvicted oftransgressing. Thus, without harming asingle
oneofhissubjects, theBodhisatta madethem observe theCommandments.
And attheclose ofalifeofalms-giving andother goodworks hepassed
away with hisfollowers tothrong thecityofthedevas.

Goodness. Ateach ofthefour city-gates hebuiltanalmonry, another in
theheart ofthecity,andyetanother athisown palace-gates, —sixinall;
andateachhedistributed ahiis topoor travellers andtheneedy. Hekept
theCommandments andobserved thefast-days ;heabounded inpatience,
loving-kindness, andmercy ;and inrighteousness heruled theland,
cherishing allcreatures alike with thefond love ofafather forhisbaby
boy.
Now oneoftheking's ministers haddealt treacherously intheking's
harem, and thisbecame matter ofcommon talk. Theministers reported it
totheking. Examining into thematter himself, theking found the
minister's guilt tobeclear. Sohesent forthe culprit, and said,"O
blinded byfolly !youhave sinned, andarenotworthy todwell inmy
kingdom;takeyour substance andyour v/ifeandfamily, andgohence."
Driven thus from therealm, that minister lefttheKasi country, and,
entering theservice oftheking ofKosala, gradually rose tobethat
monarch's confidential adviser. Onedayhesaid totheking ofKosala,
"Sire, thekingdom ofBenares islikeagoodly honeycomb untainted by
flies ;itsking isfeebleness itself ;and atrifling force would suflice to
conquer thewhole country."
Hereon, theking ofKosala reflected that thekingdom ofBenares was
large, and, considering this inconnexion with theadvice that atrifling
force could conquer it,hegi-ew suspicious that hisadviser wasahireling
suborned toleadhim into atrap. "Traitor," hecried, "youarepaid to
saythis!"
"Indeed Iamnot," answered theother; "Idobutspeak thetruth.
Ifyoudoubt me,sendmen tomassacre avillage over hisborder, andsee
whether, when they arecaught andbrought before him, theking doesnot
letthem oS"scot-free andeven loadthem with gifts."
"Heshows avery bold front inmaking hisassertion," thought the
king ;"Iwill test hiscounsel [2G.3] without delay." And accordingly
hesentsome ofhiscreatures toharry avillage across theBenares border.
The ruffians were captured andbrought before theking ofBenares, who
asked them, saying,"My children, whyhaveyoukilledmyvillagers?"
"Because wecould notmake aliving," saidthey.
"Then whydidyounotcome tomel" saidtheking. "See thatyou
donotdothelikeagain."
And hegavethem presents andsentthem away. Back theywent
andtold thistotheking ofKosala. But thisevidence wasnotenough to
nerve him totheexpedition ;andasecond band wassent tomassacre
another village, thistime intheheart ofthekingdom. These toowere
likewise sentaway with presents bytheking ofBenares. Buteven this
evidence wasnotdeemed strong enough ;andathird party wassent to
plunder thevery streets ofBenares !And these, like their forerunners,
c.J. 9


130 TlieJataha. Book I.
were sentaway with presents !Satisfied atlastthat theking ofBenares
wasanentirely good king, theking ofKosala resolved toseize onhis
kingdom, andsetoutagainst himwith troops andelephants.
Now inthese days theking ofBenares hadathousand gallant warriors,
whowould facethecharge even ofarutelephant,—whom thelaunched
thunderbolt ofIndra could not terrify,—amatchless band ofinvincible
heroes ready attheking's command toreduce allIndia tohissway !
These, hearing theking ofKosala wascoming totake Benares, came to
their sovereign with thenews, andprayed thattheymight bedespatched
against theinvader, "We willdefeat andcapture him, sire," saidthey,
"before hecansetfootovertheborder."
"Not so,mychildren," saidtheking. "None shall suffer because of
me. Letthosewho covet kingdoms seize mine, ifthey will." Andhe
refused toallow them tomarch against theinvader.
Then theking ofKosala- crossed theborder andcame tothemiddle-
country;andagain theministers went tothekingwithrenewed entreaty.
But stilltheking refused. Andnowtheking ofKosala appeared outside
thecity,andsentamessage totheking bidding him either yield upthe
kingdom orgive battle. "Ifight not," wasthemessage oftheking of
Benares inreply;"lethim seizemykingdom."
Yet athird time theking's ministers came tohimandbesought him
nottoallow theking ofKosala toenter, buttopermit them tooverthrow
andcapture himbefore the city. Still refusing, thekingbade thecity-
gates beopened, [264] and seated himself instate aloftupon hisroyal
throne with histhousand ministei-s round him.
Entering thecityandfinding none tobarhisway, theking ofKosala
passed with hisarmy totheroyal })alace. The dooi's stood openwide ;and
there onhisgorgeous throne with histhousand ministers around himsate
thegreatKing Goodness instate. "Seize them all," cried theking of
Kosala ;"tietheir hands tightly behind their backs, andaway withthem
tothecemetery !There digholes andburythem aliveuptotheneck, so
thattheycannot movehand orfoot. Thejackals willcome atnight and
givethem sepulchre !"
Atthel)idding ofthernfiianly king, hisfollowers bound theking of
Benares and hisministers, andhauled them off.Buteven inthishour
notsomuch asanangry thought didthegreat King Goodness harbour
against therufiians ;andnotamanamong hisministers, evenwhen they
were being marched offinbonds, could disobey theking,—soperfect is
saidtohavebeen thediscipline among hisfollowers.
SoKing Goodness andhisministers were ledoffandburied uptothe

Goodness exhorted hiscompanions, saying, "Letyour hearts befilled with
naught butloveandcharity, mychildren."
Now atmidnight thejackals came trooping tothebanquet ofhuman
flesh ;and atsight ofthebeasts thekingand hiscompanions raised a
mighty shout alltogether, frightening thejackals away. Halting, the
pack looked back, and, seeing noonepursuing, again came forward, A
second shout drove themaway again, butonly toreturn asbefore. But
thethird time, seeing thatnotamanamongst them allpursued, thejackals
thought tothemselves, "These must bemenwho aredoomed todeath."
Theycame onboldly ;evenwhen theshout wasagain being raised, they
didnotturn tail.Onthey came, each singling outhisprey,—thechief
jackal making fortheking, andtheother jackals forhiscompanions [265].
Fertile inresource, thekingmarked thebeast's approach, and, raising his
throat asiftoreceive the bite, fastened histeeth inthejackal's throat
with agrip likeavice !Unable tofree itsthroat from themighty grip of
theking's jaws, andfearing death, thejackal raised agi'eat howl. Athis
cryofdistress thepack conceived that their leader must havebeencaught
byaman. With noheart lefttoapproach theirowndestined prey,away
they allscampered fortheir lives.
Seeking tofree itself from theking's teeth, thetrapped jackal plunged
madly toand fro,andthereby loosened theearth above theking. Here-
upon the latter, letting thejackal go,putforth hismighty strength, and
byplunging from side tosidegothishands free !Then, clutching the
brink ofthe i)it,hedrew himself up,andcame forth likeacloud scudding
before thewind. Bidding hiscompanions beofgood cheer, henow setto
work toloosen theearth round them andtogetthem out, tillwith allhis
ministers hestood fi'eeoncemore inthecemetery.
Now itchanced that acoi'pse hadbeen exposed inthat part ofthe
cemetery which laybetween therespective domains oftwoogres ;andthe
ogres were disputing over thedivision ofthespoil.
"Wecan't divide itourselves," saidthey ;"but thisKing Goodness is
righteous; hewilldivide itfor lis.Letusgotohim." Sotheydragged
thecorp.se bythefoot totheking, and said, "Sire, divide thismanand
give useach ourshare." "Certainly Iwill,myfriends," saidtheking.
"But, asIamdirty, Imust bathe first."
Straightway, bytheir magic i)ower, theogres brought totheking the
scented water prepared fortheusurpei-'s bath. Andwhen thekinghad
bathed, they brought him therobes which hadbeen laidout forthe
usurper towear. When hehadputthese on,they brought hismajesty

they brought flowers ofdivers kinds laidoutupon jewelled fans, ina

andreturned with riceflavoured with allthechoicest flavours, which had
been prepared fortheusurper's table. And theking,nowbathed and
scented, dressed andarrayed, ateofthedainty fare. Thereupon theogres
brought theusurper's perfumed water forhim todrink, intheusurper's
owngolden bowl, notforgetting tobring thegolden cuptoo.When the
kinghaddrunk andhadwashed hismouth andwaswashing hishands,
they bi'ought himfragrant betel tochew, andasked whether hismajesty
hadanyfurther commands.''Fetch me," said he,"byyour magic power
thesword ofstatewhich liesbytheusurper's pillow." And straightway
thesword wasbrought totheking. Then theking took thecorpse, and
setting itupright, cut itintwodown thechine, giving one-half toeach
ogre. This done, thekingwashed theblade, andgirded itonhisside.
Having eaten their fill,theogres were glad ofheart, and intheir
gratitude asked thekingwhatmore they could doforhim. "Setmeby
yourmagic power," said he,"intheusurj)er's chamber, andseteach ofmy
ministers back inhisownhouse." "Certainly, sire," snidtheogres ;and
forthwith itwasdone. Now inthathour theusurper waslying asleep on
theroyal bedinhischamber ofstate. And asheslept inalltranquillity,
thegood king struck himwith the flatofthesword upon the belly.
Waking upinafright, theusurper sawbythelamp-light that itwasthe
greatKing Goodness. Summoning upallhiscourage, herosefrom his
couch andsaid:—"Sire, itisnight; aguard isset;thedoors arebarred;
andnonemay enter. How thencame youtomybedside, sword inhand
and clad inrobes ofsplendour?" Then theking toldhim indetail all
thestory ofhisescape. Then theusurper's heartwasmoved within him,
andhecried, "Oking, I,though blessed withhuman nature, knew not
yourgoodness ;butknowledge thereof wasgiven tothe fierce and cruel
ogres, whose food isfleshandblood. Henceforth, I,sire, [267] willnot
plot against such signal virtue asyou possess." Sosaying, heswore an
oath offi'iendship upon hissword andbegged theking's forgiveness. And
hemade theking liedown upon thebedofstate, while hestretched
himself upon alittle couch.
Onthemorrow atdaybreak, when thesunhad risen, hiswhole host
ofevery rank anddegree wasmustered bybeat ofdrum attheusurper's
command ;intheir presence heextolled King Goodness, asifraising the
full-moon onhigh intheheavens ;andright before them all,heagain
asked theking's forgiveness andgavehim back hiskingdom, saying,
"Henceforth, let itbemycharge todeal with rebels ;rulethou thy

Seated inmajesty andsplendour beneath awhite canopy ofsovereignty

upou athrone ofgoldwith legs asofagazelle, thegreatKing Goodness
contemplated hisown glory andthought thus within himself:—"Had I
notpersevered, Ishould notbeintheenjoyment ofthismagnificence, nor
wouldmythousand ministers bestillnumbered among theliving. Itwas
byperseverance that Irecovered theroyal state Ihad lost,andsaved the
lives ofmythousand ministers. Verily, weshould strive onunremittingly
with dauntless hearts, seeing thatthefruit ofperseverance issoexcellent."
And therewithal thekingbroke into this heai-tfelt utterance :—
Toil on,mybrother ;still inhope stand fast;
Nor letthycourage flagand tire.
Myself Isee,who, allmywoes o'erpast,Ammaster ofmyheart's desire.

"What^ Leave ^mtasted.''^ —Thia story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about some drugged liquor.
Onceonatime the ti})i)lers ofSavatthi met totake counsel, saying, "We've
notgottheprice ofadrink left ;howarewetogetit?"
"Cheer up!" saidoneruffian; "I've alittle plan."
"What maythatbe?" cried theothers.
"It's Anatha-pindika's custom," said the fellow, "towear hisrings and
richest attire, when going towaitupon theking. Letusdoctor some liquor
withastupefying drugand fitupadi-inking-booth, inwhichwewill allbesitting
when Anatha-pindika passes by.'Come and join us.LordHigh Treasurer,'
we'll cry,andplyhimwith ourliquor tillheloses hissenses. Then letus
relieve himofhisringsandclothes, andgettheprice ofadrink."
Hisplan mightily pleased theother rogues, andwasduly carried out.As
Anatha-pindika wasreturning, theywent outtomeethimandinvited him[269]
tocome along withthem ;fortheyhadgotsome rare liquor, andhemust taste
itbefore hewent.
"WhatT' thought he,"shall abeliever, wliohasfound Salvation, touch
strong drink ?Howbeit, though Ihavenocraving for it,yetwill Iexpose these
rogues." Sointotheir booth hewent, where their proceedings soonshewed him
that their liquor wasdrugged;andheresolved tomake therascals take totheir
heels. Soheroundly charged them with doctoring their liquor with aview to
drugging strangers firstandrobbing them afterwards. "You sitinthebooth
youhave opened, andyoupraise uptheliquor," saidhe;"but asfordrinking
it,notoneofyouventures onthat. Ifitisreally undrugged, drink away at
ityourselves." Thissunnnary exposure made thegang take totheir heels, and
Anatha-pindika went offhome. Thinking hemight aswell telltheincident to
theBuddha, hewent toJetavana andrelated thestory.
"This time, layman," saidtheMaster, "it isyouwhom these rogues have
tried totrick ;sotoointhepastthey tiied totrick thegoodandwise ofthose
days." Sosaying, athishearer's request, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasTreasurer ofthat city.And then toodidthesamegang
oftipplers, conspiring together inlikemanner, drug liquor, andgofortli
tomeethim injust thesame way, andmade just thesame overtures.
TheTreasurer didnotwant todrink atall,butnevertheless went with
them, solely toexpose them. Marking theii* proceedings anddetecting
their scheme, hewasanxious toscarethemaway and sorepresented that
itwould beagross thing forhim todrink spirits just before going tothe
king's palace. "Sityouhere," said he,"till I'veseen thekingandam
onmywayback;then I'llthink about it."
Onhisreturn, therascals called tohim,buttheTreasurer, fixing his

"IVken nearavillage."—Tliiswas toldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about alaybrother whowas skilled intheknowledge offruits. Itai)pears that
acertain squire ofSavattlii hadinvited theBi'otherhood with theBuddha at
their head, andhadseated them inhispleasaunce, where theywere regaled with
rice-gruel and cakes. Afterwards hebade hisgardener goround with the
Brethren andgivemangoes andother kinds offruits totheir Reverences. In
obedience toorders, themanwalked about thegrounds with theBrethren, and
could tellbyasingle glance upatthetreewhat fruitwasgreen, what nearly
ripe,andwhat quite ripe,andsoon.Andwhat hesaidwasalways found true.
SotheBrethren came totheBuddha andmentioned howexpert thegardener
was,andhow, whilst himself standing ontheground, hecould accurately tellthe
condition ofthehanging fruit. "Brethren," saidtheMaster, "this gardener is
nottheonlyonewhohashadknowledge offruits. Alikeknowledge wasshewn
bythewiseandgood offormer days also." And sosaying, hetold tliisstory of
thepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahniadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta wasborn amerchant. When hegrew up,andwastrading
with fivehundred waggons, hecame oneday towhere theroad led
through agreat forest. [271] Halting attheoutskirts, hemustered the
caravan and addressed them thus:—-"Poison-trees grow inthis forest.
Take heed thatyoutaste nounfamiliar leaf, flower, orfruit without first
consulting me." Allpromised totake every care ;andthejourney into


136 TheJataka. Book I.
theforest began. Now justwithin theforest-border stands avillage, and
just outside that village grows aWhat-fruit tree. TheWhat-fruit tree
exactly resembles amango alike intrunk, branch, leaf, flower, and fruit.
And notonly inoutward semblance, but also intaste and smell, the
fruit—ripeorunripe—mimics themango. Ifeaten, itisadeadly poison,
andcauses instant death.
Nowsome greedy fellows, whowent onahead ofthecaravan, came to
thistreeand, taking ittobeamango, ateofitsfruit. Butothers said,
"Let usaskourleader before weeat"; andthey accordingly halted by
thetree, fruit inhand, tillhecame up. Perceiving that itwasnomango,
hesaid:—"This'mango'isaWhat-fruit tree;don't touch itsfruit."
Having stopped them from eating, theBodhisatta turned hisattention
tothosewhohadalready eaten. First hedosed them with anemeti(;,
andthen hegavethem thefoursweet foods toeat ;sothat intheend
they recovered.
Nowonformer occasions caravans hadhalted beneath thissame tree,
andhaddied from eating thepoisonous fruit which they mistook for
mangoes. Onthemorrow the villagers woukl come, andseeing them
lying there dead, would flingthem bythe heels intoasecret place,
departing with allthebelongings ofthecaravan, waggons and all.
Andonthedaytooofourstory these villagers failed nottohurry at
daybreak tothetree fortheir expected spoils. "Theoxenmust beours,"
saidsome. "And we'll have thewaggons," sai<l others;—whilst others
again claimed thewares astheir share. Butwhen theycame breathless
tothetree, there wasthewhole cai-avan aliveandwell!
"Howcame you toknow thiswasnotamango-tree 1"demanded the
disappointed villagers. "We didn't know," saidthey ofthecaravan; "it
wasourleader whoknew."
80thevillagers came totheBodhisatta and said, "Man ofwisdom,
what didyoudotofindoutthistreewasnotamango 1"
"Two things toldme," replied theBodhisatta, andherepeated this

"When noAttachment" —This story wastold l>ytheMaster while atJeta-
vana, about aBrother whohadgiven upallearnest effort.
SaidtheMaster tohim, "Isthereport true, Brother, that 3'ouareaback-
slider?"
"Yes, Blessed One."
"Inbygone days, Brother," saidtheMaster, "thewiseandgoodwonathrone
bytheir dauntless perseverance inthehour ofneed."
And sosaying, hetold this stoi-y ofthepast.
Once onatime wlien Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, itwasas
his(jueen's child thattheBodhisatta came tolifeonce more. Ontheday
when hewastobenamed, thejiarents enquired astotheir child's destiny
from eight hundred brahmins, towhom tlieygave their hearts' desire iu
allpleasures ofsense. INtarking thepromise which heshewed ofa
glorious destiny, these clever soothsaying brahmins foretold that,coming
tothethrone attheking's death, thechild should beamighty king
endowed with every virtue ;famed andrenowned forhisexploits with
fiveweapons, heshould stand peerless inallJambudipa'. [273]And
because ofthisprophecy ofthebrahmins, theparents named their son
Prince Five-Weapons.
Now, when theprince wascome toyears ofdiscretion, andwas
sixteen years old,thekingbadehimgoaway andstudy,
"With whom, sire,amItostudy?" asked theprince.
"With theworld-famed teacher inthetown ofTakkasila inthe
Gandhara country. Here ishisfee," said theking, handing hissona
thousand pieces.
Sotheprince went toTakkasila andwastaught there. When hewas
leaving, hismaster gavehimasetoffiveweapons, armed with which,
after Itidding adieu tohisoldmaster, theprince setoutfrom Takkasila for
Benares.
Onhiswayhecame toaforest haunted byanogrenamed Hairy -grip;
and, attheentrance totheforest, menwhomethim tried tostop him,
saying:—"Young brahmin, donotgothrough that forest; itisthehaunt

oftheogre Hairy-grip, andhekillsevery onehemeets." But,bold asa
lion, theself-reliant Bodhisatta pressed on, tillintheheart oftheforest he
came ontheogre. Themonster made himself appear instature astallas
apalm-tree, with ahead asbigasanarbour andhuge eyes likebowls,
withtwotusks liketurnips andthebeak ofahawk ;hisbellywasblotched
with purple ;andthepalms ofhishands andthesoles ofhisfeetwere
blue-black! "Whither away?" cried themonster. "Halt! youaremy
prey.""Ogre," answered theBodhisatta, "Iknew what Iwasdoing
when entering this forest. You willbeill-advised tocome near me. For
with apoisoned arrow Iwill slayyouwhere youstand." And with this
defiance, hefitted tohisbowanarrow dipped indeadliest poison andshot
itattheogre. But itonlystuck ontothemonster's shaggy coat. Then he
shotanother andanother, till fiftywere spent, allofwhich merely stuck
ontotheogre's shaggy coat. Hereon theogre, shaking thearrows off'so
that they fellathisfeet,came attheBodhisatta ;andthe latter, again
shouting defiance, drew hissword andstruck attheogre. But, likethe
arrows, hissword, which wasthirty-three inches long, merely stuck fastin
theshaggy hair. Next theBodhisatta hurled hisspear, andthat stuck
fast also. Seeing this, hesmote theogrewith hisclub ;but, like his
other weapons, that toostuck fast. And thereupon theBodhisatta
shouted, "Ogre, younever heard yetofme,[274] Prince Five-Weapons.
When Iventured into this forest, Iputmytrust notinmybowandother
weapons, butinmyself !Now willIstrike youablowwhich shall crush
youintodust." Sosaying, theBodhisatta smote theogre with hisright
hand ;butthehand stuck fastupon the hair. Then, inturn, with his
lefthandandwith hisright and left feet,hestruck atthemonster, but
handandfeetalike clave tothehide. Again shouting "Iwillcrush you
intodust!"hebutted theogrewith hishead, andthattoostuck fast.
Yetevenwhen thuscaught andsnared infivefold wise, theBodhisatta,
ashehung upon theogre, was still fearless, stillundaunted. And the
monster thought tohimself, "This isavery lionamong men, ahero
without apeer,andnomere man. Though heiscaught intheclutches of
anogre likeme,yetnotsomuch asatremor willheexhibit. Never,
since Ifirsttook toslaying travellers upon this road, have Iseen aman
toequal him.How coines itthatheisnotfrightened?"Notdaring to
devour theBodhisatta offliand, hesaid, "How isit,young brahmin, that
youhavenofearofdeath ?"
"Why should I?"answered theBodhisatta. "Each lifemust surely
have itsdestined death. Moreover, within mybody isasword of
adamant, which youwillnever digest, ifyou eatme. Itwillchopyour
inwards intomincemeat, andmydeath willinvolve yours too. Therefore
itisthat 1have nofear." (By this, itissaid, theBodhisatta meant
theSword ofKnowledge, which waswithin him.)


No. 55. 139
Hereon, theogre fella-thinking. "Thisyoung brahmin isspeaking
thetx'uth andnothing butthetruth," thought he."Not amorsel sobig
asapeacould Idigest ofsuch ahero. I'lllethimgo."And so,infear
ofhis life,helettheBodhisatta gofree, saying, "Young brahmin, youare
alionamong men ;Iwillnoteatyou.Goforth frommyhand, even as
themoon from thejaws ofRahu, andreturn togladden thehearts of
your kinsfolk, your friends, andyour country."
"Asformyself, ogi'e," answered theBodhisatta, "Iwill go.Asfor
you, itwasyour sins inbygone days thatcaused you tobereborn a
ravening, murderous, flesh-eating ogre ;and, if[275] youcontinue insin
inthisexistence, 3onwillgoonfrom darkness todarkness. But,having

ghost oramong thefallen spirits. Or, ifthere-birth beintotheworld
ofmen, thensuch sincutsshort thedays ofaman's life."
Inthisandother ways theBodhisatta shewed theevilconsequences of
thefivebadcourses, andtheblessing thatcomes ofthefivegood courses;
andsowrought indivers ways u})on that ogre's fears thatbyhisteaching
heconverted themonster, imbuing himwith self-denial andestablishing
him intheFiveCommandments. Thenmaking theogrethefairy ofthat
forest, with aright tolevy dues', and chai'ging him toremain stedfast,
theBodhisatta Aveiit hisway, making known thechange intheogre's
mood asheissued from theforest. And intheendhecame, armed with
thefiveweapons, tothecityofBenares, andpresented himself before his
parents. Inlater days,when king, hewasarigliteous ruler ;and after a
lifespent inchai'ity andother goodworks hepassed away tofare there-
after accoidinir tohisdeserts.
This lesson ended, theMaster, asBuddha, recited thisstanza:—

When hehadthus ledhisteaching uptoArahatship asitscrowning point,
theMaster wentontopreach theFour Truths, attheclosewhereof thatBrother

"When gladness.''^—This story was toldbytheMaster while atSavatthi,
about acertain Brother. Tradition says that through hearing theMaster
preach ayoung gentleman ofSavatthi gave hisheart totheprecious Faithiand
became aBrother. Histeachers andmasters proceeded toinstruct him inthe
whole oftheTenPrecepts ofMorality, oneafter theother, expounded tohimthe
Short, theMedium, andtheLong Moralities-, setforth the^Morality which rests
onself-restraint according tothePatimokkha', theMorality which restsonself-
restraint astotheSenses, theMorality which rests onablameless walk
of life, theMorality which relates tothewtiy aBrother may usethe
Requisites. Thought theyoung beginner, "There isatremendous lotofthis
Morality ;and Ishall undoubtedly failtofulfil allIhavevowed. Yetwhat is
thegood ofbeing abrother atall, ifonecannot keep therules ofMorality 1My
be.stcourse istogoback totheworld, takeawifeandrearchildren, living alife

saying thatheproposed toreturn tothelower state ofalayman, andwished to
hand back hisbowlandrobes. "Well, ifitbesowith you," saidthey,"atleast
take leave oftheBuddha before yougo;" andthey brought theyoung man
before theMaster intheHall ofTruth.
"AVhy, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "areyoubringing thisBrother tome
against hiswill?"
"Sir, hesaid that Morality wasmore than hecould observe, andwanted
togiveback hisrobes andbowl. Sowetookhimandbrought him toyou."
"But why, Brethren," asked theMaster, "didyouburthen himwith so
much \Hecandowhat hecan,butnomore. Donotmake thismistake again,
andleavemetodecide what should bedone inthecase."
Then, turning totheyoung Brother, theMaster said,"Come, Brother; what
concern haveyouwith Morality inthemass? Doyouthink youcould obey
justthree moral rules?"
"Oh, yes. Sir."
"Well now,watch andguard thethree avenues ofthevoice, themind, and
thebody ;donoevilwhether inword, orthought, oract. Cease nottobea
Brother, butgohence andobey justthese three rules."
"Yes, indeed. Sir, Iwillkeepthem," hereexclaimed thegladyoung man,and
back hewent with histeachers again. And ashewaskeeping histhree rules,
hethought within himself, "Ihadthewhole ofMorality tokimebymy in-
structors;butbecause theywerenottheBuddha, they could notmakemegrasp
even this nuich. Whereas [277] theAll-Enlightened One,byi-eason ofhis

hewonInsight andinafewdays attained Arahatship. When thiscame tothe
earsoftheBrethren, theyspoke ofitwhen mettogether intheHall ofTruth,
telling howtheBrother, whowasgoing back totheworld because hecould not
hope tofulfil Morality, hadbeen furnished bytheMaster with three rules
embodying thewhole of]\Iorality, andhadbeenmade tograsp those three rules,
andsohadbeen enabled bytheMaster towinArahatship. How marvellous,
they cried, wastheBuddha.
Entering theHall atthis point, andlearning onenquiry thesubject oftheir
talk, theMaster said, "Brethren, even aheavy burthen becomes light, iftaken
piecemeal ;andthus thewiseandgood ofpast times, onfinding ahugemass of
gold tooheavy tolift, firstbroke itupandthen were enabled tobear their
treasure away piece bypiece." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasafarmer inavillage, andwasploughing one
dayinafieldwhere once stood avillage. Now, inbygone days, awealthy
merchant haddiedleaving buried inthis field ahuge barofgold, asthick
round asaman's thigh, andfourwhole cubits inlength. And fullonthis
barstruck theBodhisatta's plough, and thei'e stuck fast. Taking ittobe
aspreading root ofatree,hedug itout ;butdiscovering itsrealnature,
hesettowork toclean thedirt offthegold. The day'swork done, at
sunset helaid aside liisplough and gear, andessayed toshoulder his
treasure-trove andwalk ofi'with it.But, ashecould notsomuch aslift
it,hesatdown before itand fella-thinking what useshewould put itto.
"I'll have somuch tolive on,somuch tobury asatreasure, somuch
totrade witli, and somuch forcharity andgood works," thought heto
himself, and accordingly cutthegold into four. Division made his
burthen easy tocarry ;andheborehome thelumps ofgold. After a
lifeofcharity andother good works, hepassed away tofare thereafter
accordinor tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster, asBuddha, recited thisstanza:—[278]
When gladness fillstheheart and fillsthemind,
When righteousness ispractised Peace towin.
Hewho sowalks shall gain thevictory
And alltheFetters utterly destroy.
Andwhen theMaster hadthus ledhisteaching uptoArahatship asits

"Inthose days Imyself wasthemanwhogotthenugget ofgold."

"Whoso, monley-hingP —This story wastoldbytheMaster, while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta's going about tokillhim. Being informed of
Devadatta's mm-derous intent, theMaster said, "This isnotthe first time.
Brethren, thatDevadatta hasgone about seeking tokillme;hedidjustthe
same inbygone days, butfailed towork hiswicked will." And sosaying, he
toldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asamonkey. When full-grown, hewas
asbigasamare's foalandenormously strong. Helived alone onthe
banks ofariver, inthemiddle ofwhich wasanisland whei'eon grew
mangoes andbread-fruits, andother fruit-trees. And inmid-stream, half-
waybetween theisland andtheriver-bank, asolitaiy rock roseoutofthe
watei'. Being asstrong asanelephant, theBodhisatta used toleapfrom
thebankontothisrockandthence ontotheisland. Here hewould eat
his fillofthefruits thatgrew ontheisland, returning atevening bythe
wayhecame. Andsuchwashislifefromday today.
Now there lived inthose days inthat river acrocodile and liis
mate;and she,being withyoung, wasledbythesight oftheBodhisatta
journeying toand frotoconceive [279] alonging forthemonkey's
heart toeat. Soshebegged her lord tocatch themonkey forher.
Promising that sheshould have her f;incy, thecrocodile went offand
took hisstand ontherock,meaning tocatch themonkey onhisevening
journey home.
After ranging about theisland allday, theBodhisatta looked outat
evening towards therockandwondered why therock stood sohigh out
ofthewater. Forthestory goes that theBodhisatta always marked the
exact height ofthewater intheriver, andoftherock inthewater. So,
when hesaw that, though thewater stood atthesame level, therock
seemed tostand higher outofthewater, hesuspected thatacrocodile
might belurking there tocatch him. And, inorder tofindoutthefacts
ofthe case, heshouted, asthough addressing therock, "Hi! rock!"
And, asnoreply came back, heshouted three times, "Hi! rock!" And


No. 57. 143
astherock stillkept silence, themonkey called out,"How comes it,
friend rock, thatyouwon't answer meto-day?"
"Oh!" thought thecrocodile; "sotherock's inthehabit ofanswering
themonkey. Imust answer fortherock to-day." Accordingly, he
shouted, "Yes, monkey; what isit?""Who areyou?" saidtheBodhi-
satta. "I'm acrocodile." "What areyou sitting onthat rock for?"
"Tocatch youandeatyour heart." Astherewasnootherwayback, the
only thing tobedonewas tooutwit thecrocodile. SotheBodhisatta
cried out,"There's nohelp foritthenbuttogivemyself uptoyou.Open
yourmouth andcatchmewhen Ijump."
Now youmustknow thatwhen crocodiles open their mouths, their
eyes shut'. So,when this crocodile unsuspiciously opened hismouth, his
eyes shut. And there hewaited with closed eyesandopenjaws !Seeing
this,thewilymonkey made ajump ontothecrocodile's head, andthence,
with aspring like liglitning, gained thebank. When thecleverness of
this featdawned onthe crocodile, hesaid,"Monkey, hethat inthis
world [280] possesses thefour virtues overcomes hisfoes.And you,me-
thinks, possess allfour." And, sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Whoso, monkey-king, likeyou,combines
Truth, foresight, fixed resolve, and fearlessness.
Shall seehisrouted foemen turnand flee.
And with this praise oftheBodhisatta, the ci'ocodile betook himself to
hisown dwelling-place.
SaidtheMaster, "This isnotthefirsttime then, Bretliren, thatDevadatta has
goneabout seeking tokillme;hedidjustthesame inbygone days too." And,
having ended hislesson, theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified the
Birth bysaying, "Devadiitta wasthecrocodile ofthose days, tliebrahmin-girl
Cinca^ wasthecrocodile's wife,and Imyself theMonkey-King."

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, Devadatta
came tolifeagain asamonkey, anddwelt near theHimalayas asthe
lord ofatribe ofmonkeys allofhisown begetting. Filled with fore-
bodings that hismale offspring might grow uptoousthimfrom his
lordship, heused togeld[281] them allwith histeeth. Now theBodhi-
sattahadbeen begotten bythissamemonkey ;and hismother, inorder
tosave herunborn progeny, stoleaway toaforest atthefoot ofthe
mountain, where indueseason shegave birth totheBodhisatta. And
when hewasfull-grown andhadcome toyears ofunderstanding, hewas
gifted withmarvellous strength.
"Where ismyfather'?" saidheonedaytohismother. "He dwells
atthefootofacertain mountain, myson," shereplied; "and isking
ofatribe ofmonkeys." "Takemetoseehim,mother." "Not so,my
son ;foryour father issoafraid ofbeing supplanted byhissons that
hegeldsthem allwith histeeth." "Never mind; takemethere, mother,"
.saidtheBodhisatta; "Ishallknow what todo." Soshetookhimwith
hertotheoldmonkey. Atsight ofhisson,theoldmonkey, feeling sure
that theBodhisatta would growuptodepose him, resolved byafeigned
embrace tocrush the lifeoutoftheBodhisatta. "Ah!myboy!" he
cried; "where haveyoubeen allthislong time*?" And,making ashow
ofembracing theBodhisatta, hehugged him like avice. But the
Bodhisatta, whowas asstrong asanelephant, returned thehug so
mightily that hisfather's ribswere liketobreak.
Then thought theoldmonkey, "Thissonofmine, ifhegrows up,will

theBodhisatta;aud otfhestarted. Approaching thelakewith caution,
hestudied thefootprints onitsbanks andmarked how allofthem led
doivn tothewater, butnone evercame back. Realising thatthelakewas
haunted byanogre, hedivined that hisfather, being unable himself tokill
him,wished togethimkilled [282] bytheogre. "But I'llgetthelotuses,"
said he,"without going into thewater atall." Sohewent toadry
spot,andtaking arunleaped from thebank. Inhisjump, ashewas
clearing thewater, heplucked two flowers which grew upabove the
surface ofthewater, andalighted withthem ontheopposite bank. On
hiswayback, heplucked twomore inlikemanner, ashejumped;and
somade aheap onboth sides ofthelake,—butalways keeping outof
theogre's watery domain. When hehadpicked asmany ashethought
hecould carry across, andwasgathering together those ononebank,
theastonished ogre exclaimed, "I've lived alongtime inthis lake, but
Inever saweven ahuman being sowonderfully clever !Here isthis
monkey whohaspicked alltheflowers hewants, andyethaskept safely
outofrange ofmyjjower." And, parting thewaters asunder, theogre
came upoutofthelake towhere theBodhisatta stood, andaddressed
him thus,"0king ofthemonkeys, hethathasthree qualities shallhave
themastery over hisenemies ;andyou,methinks, have allthree." And,
sosaying, herepeated thisstanza intheBodhisatta's praise:—
Whoso, likeyou, monkey-king, combines
Dexterity andValour andResource,
Shall seehisrouted foemen turnand flee.
Hispraises ended, theogreasked theBodhisatta whyhewasgathering

"My father isminded tomakemeking ofhistribe," saidtheBodhi-
satta, "and that iswhy Iamgathering them."
"But one .sopeerle.ss asyouought nottocarry flowers," exclaimed
theogre; "Iwillcarry them foryou." And sosaying, hepicked upthe

Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasabrahmin inthe city ofTakkasila inthe
Gandliara country ;andbythetime heliadgrown up,such was his
proficiency intheThree Vedas and allaccomplishments, that hisfame as
ateacher spread through alltheworld.
Inthose days there wasabrahmin family inBenares, untowhom a
sonwasbom;andonthedayofhisbirth they took fireandkept it
always bvirning, until theboywas sixteen. Then hisparents toldhim
how the fire,kindled onthedayofhisbirth, hadnever been allowed to
goout ;andtheybade their sonmake hischoice. Ifhisheart was set
onwinning enti'ance hereafter into theRealm ofBrahma, then lethim
takethe fireand retire with ittotheforest, there towork outhisdesire
byceaseless worship oftheLord ofFire. But, ifhepreferred thejoys
ofahome, theybade their songotoTakkasila andthere study under

andmother, and,with athousand pieces ofmoney fortheteacher's fee,
setoutforTakkasila. There hestudied tillhiseducation wascomplete,
andthen betook himself home again.
Now hisparents grew towishhimtoforsake theworld andtoworship

desjiatch him totheforest bybringing home tohim thewickedness of
women, wasconfident that hiswiseandlearned teacher would beable
tolaybarethewickedness ofthesextoherson,andsosheasked whether
hehadquite finished hiseducation. "Oh yes," saidtheyouth.
[286]"Then ofcourse youhave notomitted theDolour Texts?" "I
have notlearnt those, mother." "How thencanyousayyour education
isfinished? Goback atonce,myson, toyour master, andreturn to
uswhen youhave learnt them," said hismother.
"Very good," saidtheyouth, and offhestai-ted forTakkasila once
more.
Now hismaster toohadamother,— anoldwoman ofahundred and
twenty years ofage,—whom with hisownhands heused tobathe, feed
andtend. And forsodoing hewasscorned byhisneighbours,—somuch
soindeed thatheresolved todepart totheforest and there dwell with
hismother. Accordingly, inthesolitude ofaforest hehadahutbuilt
inadelightful spot, where water was plentiful, and after laying ina
stock ofgheeand riceandother provisions, hecarried hismother toher
newhome, andthere lived cherishing heroldage.
Not finding hismaster atTakkasila, theyoung brahmin made en-
quiries, and finding outwhat hadhappened, setout forthe forest, and
presented himself respectfully before hismaster. "What brings you

back sosoon,mybay?" saidthe latter. "Idonotthink, sir,1learned
theDolour Texts when Iwaswith you," saidtheyouth. "Butwho told
youthatyouhadtolearn theDolour Texts?""Mymother, master," was
thereply. Hereon theBodhisatta reflected that there werenosuch texts
asthose, andconcluded that hispupil's mother must have wanted her
sontolearnhowwicked women were. Sohesaid totheyouth that it
was allright, andthatheshould induecourse betaught theTexts in
question. "From to-day," said he,"you shall takemyplace aboutmy
mother, andwith yourownhands wash, feedandlook after her.As
yourubherhands, feet, head and back, becareful toexclaim, 'Ah,
Madam! ifyouaresolovely nowyouaresoold,what must younot
havebeen intheheyday ofyour youth!' And asyouwash andperfume
herhands and feet, burst into praise oftheir beauty. Further, tellme
without shame orreserve every single wordmymother says toyou. Obey
meinthis,andyou shallmaster theDolour Texts ;disobey me,andyou
shallremain ignorant ofthem forever."
Obedient tohismaster's commands, theyouth did allhewasbidden,
and sopersistently praised theoldwoman's beauty that shethought he
had fallen inlove with her; and, blind and decrepit though shewas,
passion waskindled within her[287]. Soonedayshebroke inonhiscom-
pliments byasking, "Isyour desire towards me?" "It isindeed, madam,"
answered theyouth; "butmymaster issostrict." "Ifyoudesire me,"
said she,"killmyson!" "Buthow shall I,thathave learned somuch
from him,—how shall Iforpassion's sake killmymaster?" "Well then,
ifyouwillbefaithful tome, Iwill killhimmyself."
(So lustful, vile,anddegraded arewomen that, giving therein tolust,
ahag like this,and oldasshewas, actually thirsted fortheblood ofso
dutiful ason!)
Now theyoung brahmin told allthis totheBodhisatta, who, com-
mending him forreporting thematter, studied howmuch longer his
mother wasdestined tolive. Finding thatherdestiny was todiethat
very day,hesaid,"Come, young brahmin; Iwillputhertothetest." So
hecutdown afig-tree andhewed outofitawooden figure about hisown
size,which hewrapped up,headand all,inarobeandlaidupon hisown
bed,—with astring tied toit."Now gowithanaxetomymother," said
he;"and giveherthisstring asaclue toguide hersteps."
Soaway went theyouth totheoldwoman, and said,"Madam, the
master islyingdown indoors onhisbed; Ihave tied thisstring asaclue
toguide you; take thisaxeand killhim, ifyoucan." "But youwon't
forsake me,willyou?" said she."Why should 11"was hisreply. So
shetook theaxe, and, rising upwith trembling limbs, groped herway
along bythestring, tillshethought she felther son. Then shebared
thehead ofthefigure,and— thinking tokillhersonatasingleblow—


150 The Jcltaka. Book I.
brought down theaxeright onthefigure's throat,—only tolearnbythe
thud that itwaswood! "What areyoudoing, mother?" saidtheBodhi-
satta. With ashriek that shewasbetrayed, theoldwoman felldead to
theground. For, says tradition, itwasfated that sheshould dieatthat
verymoment andunder herown roof.
Seeing that shewas dead, hersonburnt lierbody, and,when the
flames ofthe pilewere quenched, graced herashes with wild-flowers.
Then with theyoung brahmin hesatatthedoor ofthehutand said,
"My son,there isnosuch separate passage asthe'Dolour Text.' [28S]
Itiswomen who aredepi'avity incarnate. Andwhen yourmother sent
youback tometolearn theDolour Texts, her object was thatyou
shoidd learnhowwicked women are.Youhavenowwitnessed withyour
owneyesmymother's wickedness, andtherefrom you willseehow lustful
and vilewomen are."Andwith this lesson, hebade theyouth depart.
Bidding farewell tohismaster, theyoung brahmin wenthome tohis
parents. Said hismother tohim, "Have younow leai-nt theDolour
Texts 1"
"Yes,mother."
"And what," slieasked, "isyour final choice? willyou leave the
woi-ld toworship the Loixl ofFire, orwillyouchoose afamily life?"
"Nay," answered theyoung bi-ahmin; "with myown eyeshave Iseen
thewickedness ofwomankind ;Iwillhavenothing todowith family life.
Iwillrenounce theworld." And hisconvictions found vent inthis
stanza:—
Inlustunbridled, likedevouring fire,
Arewomen,—frantic intheir rage.
The sexrenouncing, fainwould Iretire
Tofindpeace inahermitage.
[289]With thisinvective against womankind, theyoung brahmin took
leave ofhispai'ents, andrenounced theworld forthehermit's life,—
wherein winning thepeace hedesired, heassured himself ofadmittance
after that lifeintotheRealm ofBrahma.
"Soyou see.Brother," saidtheMaster, "how lustful, vile,andwoe-bringing
arewomen." And after declaring thewickedness ofwomen, hepreached the
Four Truths, attheclose whereof thatBrother wontheFruit oftheFirst Path.
Lastly, tlieMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying,
"Kapilanli wasthemother ofthose days,Maha-Kassapa wasthefather, Anauda
the pu))il, and Imyself theteacher."

"Blindfold, a-lutiuff."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about another passioii-tost person.
SaidtheMaster, "Isthereport truethatyouarepassion-tost, Brother 1"
"Quite true," wasthereply.
"Brother, women cannotbewarded;indays gonebythewisewhokept
watch overawoman from themoment shewasborn, failed nevertheless tokeep
hersafe." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta came tolifeasthechild oftheQueen-consort. When liegrew
up,hemastered every accomplishment;andwhen, athisfather's death,
hecame tobeking, hoproved arighteous king.Nowheused toplay at
dicewith hischaplain, and, asheflung thegolden diceupon thesilver
table, hewould sing thiscatch forluck :—
'Tisnatm-e's lawthat rivers wind;
Trees grow ofwood bylawofkind;
And, given opportunity.
Allwomen work iniquity.
[290]Asthese linesalways made thekingwinthegame, thechaplain was
inafairway toloseevery penny hehad intheworld. And, inorder
tosave himself from utter ruin, heresolved toseek outalittle maid
thathadnever seen another man,andthen tokeep herunder lockand
keyinhisown house. "For," thought he,"Icouldn't manage tolook
after agirlwho hasseen another man. SoImust take anew-born
baby girl,andkeep herundermythumb asshegrows up,with aclose
guard over her, sothatnonemaycome near herandthat shemay be
true tooneman. Then Ishallwin oftheking, andgrow rich." Now
hewas skilled inprognostication ;and seeing apoorwoman whowas
about tobecome amother, andknowing thatherchild would beagirl,
hepaid thewoman tocome andbeconfined inhishouse, andsenther
away after herconfinement with a])resent. Theinfant wasbrought up
entirely bywomen, andnomen—other than himself—were everallowed
toseteyesonher.When thegirlgrew up,shewassubject tohimand
hewashermaster.
Now, while the girlwasgrowing up,thechaplain forbore toplay
with theking; butwhen shewasgrown upandunder hisown control.


152 21ieJdtaka. Book I.
hechallenged theking toagame. Theking accepted, andplay began.
But,when inthrowing the dice theking sang hislucky catch, the
chaplain added,—"always excepting my girl." And then luck changed,
and itwasnowthechaplain whowon, while theking lost.
Thinking thematter over, theBodhisatta suspected thechaplain had
avirtuous girlshutupinhishouse; andenquiry proved hissuspicions
true. Then, inorder towork her fall,hesent foraclever scamp, and
asked whether hethought hecould seduce the girl. "Certainly, sire,"
saidthefellow. Sothekinggavehimmoney, andsenthimaway with
orders tolosenotime.
With theking's money thefellow bought perfumes andincense and
aromatics ofallsorts, andopened aperfumery shop close tothechaplain's
house. Now thechaplain's house wasseven stories high,andhadseven
gateways, ateach ofwhich aguard was set,—^aguard ofwomen only,—-
andnomanbutthebrahmin himself waseverallowed toenter. Thevery
baskets thatcontained thedustandsweepings [291] wereexamined before
theywere passed in.Only thechaplain wasallowed toseethegirl,and
shehadonlyasingle waiting-woman. Thiswoman hadmoney given her
tobuyflowers andperfumes forhermistress, andonherwaysheused to
passnear theshopwhich thescamp hadopened. And he,knowing very
well that shewasthe girl's attendant, watched onedayfurhercoming,
and,rushing outofhisshop, fellather feet, clasping herknees tightly
with both hands andblubbering out, "mymother Iwhere have you
been allthislongtime?"
And hisconfederates, who stood byhisside, cried,"What alikeness !
Hand and foot, faceand figure, even instyle ofdress, they areidentical!"
Asoneand allkept dwelling onthemarvellous likeness, thepoorwoman
lostherhead. Ci'ying outthat itmust beherboy,shetooburst into tears.
Andwithweeping andtears thetwo felltoembracing oneanother. Then
saidtheman,"Where areyouliving, mother?"
"Up atthechaplain's, myson.Hehasayoung wife ofpeerless
beauty, avery goddess forgrace; andI'mherwaiting-woman." "And
whither away now, mother?" "Tobuy herperfumes and flowers."
"Why goelsewhere for tlieni ?Come tomeforthem infuture," said
thefellow. And hegave thewoman betel, bdellium, and soforth, and
allkinds offlowers, refusing allpayment. Struck with thequantity of
flowers andperfumes Avhich thewaiting-woman bi'ought home, the girl
askedwhythebrahmin wassopleased with herthat day."Why doyou
saythat,mydear?" asked theoldwoman. "Because ofthequantity of
things youhave brought home." "No, itisn't that thebrahmin was
freewith hismoney," saidtheoldwoman;"for Igotthem atmyson's."
Andfrom thatdayforth shekept themoney thebrahmin gave her,and
gotherflowers andother things free ofcharge attheman's shop.

And he,afewdays later,made outtobe ill,andtook tohisbed.
Sowhen theoldwoman came totheshopandasked forherson,shewas
toldhehadbeen taken ill.Hastening tohisside, shefondly stroked
hisshoulders, assheasked what ailed him. Buthemade noreply.
"Why don't you tellme,mysou?'' "Not even ifIwere dying, could I
tellyou, mother." "But, ifyoudon't tellme,[292]whom areyou to
tell]" "Well then, mother, mymalady liessolely inthis that, hearing the
praises ofyouryoung mistress's beauty, Ihave fallen inlovewith her.
It'Iwin her, Ishall live; ifnot, this willbemydeath-bed." "Leave
that tome,myboy," said theoldwoman cheerily ;"and don't worry
yourself onthisaccount." Then—with aheavy load ofperfumes and
flowers totakewith her—shewent home, andsaid tothebrahmin's young
wife, "Alas! here'smysoninlovewith you,merely because Itoldhim
howbeautiful youare !What istobodone 1"
"Ifyoucansmuggle him inhere," replied the girl,"you havemy
leave."
Hereupon theoldwoman settowork sweeping together allthedust
shecould findinthehouse from toptobottom ;thisdust sheputintoa
huge flower-basket, andtried topassoutwith it.When theusual search
wasmade, sheemptied dust over thewoman onguard, who fledaway
under such ill-treatment. Inlikemanner shedealt with alltheother
watchers, smothering indust eachoneinturn that saidanything toher.
And soitcame topassfrom thattime forward that,nomatter what the
oldwoman took inoroutofthehouse, there wasnobody boldenough to
search her.Now wasthetime !The oldwoman smuggled thescamp
intothehouse inaflower-basket, andbrought him toheryoung mistress.
Hesucceeded inwrecking the girl's virtue, andactually stayed adayor
two intheupper rooms,—-hiding when thechaplain was athome, and
enjoying the society ofhismistress when thechaplain was offthe
premises. Adayortwopassed andthegirlsaid toher lover, "Sweet-
heart, youmust begoing now." "Very well; only Imust cuff" the
brahmin first." "Certainly," said she,andhidthescamp. Then, when
thebrahmin came inagain, sheexclaimed, "Oh,mydear husband, I
should solike todance, ifyouwould play thelute forme." "Dance
away,mydear," said thechaplain, andstruck upforthwiili. "But I
shall betooashamed, ifyou're looking. Letmehideyourhandsome face
firstwith acloth; andthen Iwilldance." "All right," saidhe;"if
you're toomodest todance otherwise." Soshetook athick clothandtied
itover thebrahmin's face soastoblindfold him. And, blindfolded ashe
was, thebrahmin began toplaythelute. After dancing awhile, shecried,
"My dear, Ishould solike tohityouonce onthehead." "Hit away,"
saidtheunsuspecting dotard. Then thegirlmade asign toherparamour;
andhesoftly stoleupbehiiul thel)rahmin [293] andsmote himonthehead.


154 TheJataka. Book I.
Sucliwastheforce oftheblow, that thebrahmin's eyeswere liketostart
outofhishead, andabump roseuponthespot. Smarting with pain,he
called tothegirl togivehimherhand; andsheplaced itinhis."Ah !
it'sasofthand," saidhe;"but ithitshard!"
Now, assoon asthescamp hadstruck thebrahmin, hehid ;andwhen
hewashidden, the girltook thebandage offthechaplain's eyesand
rubbed hisbruised head with oil.Themoment thebrahmin went out,
thescamp was.stowed away inhisbasket again bytheoldwoman, andso
carried outofthehouse. Making hisway atonce totheking, hetold
himthewhole adventure.
Accordingly, when thebrahmin wasnext inattendance, theking
proposed agame with thedice;thebrahmin waswilling ;andthedicing-
table wasbrought out.Asthekingmade histhrow, hesang hisold
catch, andthebrahmin—ignorant ofthe girl's naughtiness—added his
"always excepting my girl,"^—andnevertheless lost!
Then theking,whodidknow what hadpassed, said tohischaplain,
"Why except herl Her virtue hasgiven way. Ah,youdreamed that
bytaking agirlinthehour ofherbirth andbyplacing asevenfold guard
round her,youcould becertain ofher.Why, youcouldn't becertain of

youasyouplayed thelute toher,sheletherparamour strike youonthe
head, andthensmuggled himoutofthehouse. Where then isyour

Blindfold, a-luting, byhiswife beguiled.
Thebrahmin sits,—who tried torear
Aparagon ofvirtue undefiled I
Learn hence tohold thesexinfear.
[294] InsuchwisedidtheBodhisatta expound theTruth tothebralnnin.
And thebrahmin wenthome andtaxed the girlwith thewickedness of
which shewas acciised. "My dearhusband, who canhave saidsuch a
thing about mel" said she. "Indeed Iaminnocent; indeed itwasmy
ownhand, andnobody else's, that struck you ;and, ifyoudonotbelieve
me,Iwillbrave theordeal offiretoprove thatnoman's hand hastouched

brahmin. Andhehadaquantity ofwood brought and setlight to it.
Then thegirlwassummoned. "Now," said he,"ifyoubelieve yourown
story, brave tliese flames!"
Now before thisthe girlhadinstructed herattendant asfollows:—
"Tell your son,mother, tobethere and toseizemyhand just asIam
about togointothe fire." And theoldwoman didasshewasbidden;
andthefellow came andtook hisstand among thecrowd. Then, to

delude thebrahmin, the girl, standing there before allthe people,
exclaimed with fervour, "No man's hand butthine, brahmin, hasever
touched me ;and,bythetruth ofmyasseveration Icallonthis fireto
harmmenot." Sosaying, sheadvanced totheburning pile,—when up
dashed herparamour, who seized herbythehand, crying shame onthe
brahmin whocould force sofairamaid toenter theflames !Shaking her
hand free, thegirlexclaimed tothebrahmin thatwhat shehadasserted
wasnow undone, andthat shecould notnow brave theordeal offire.
"Why nof?" saidthebrahmin. "Because," shereplied, "my asseveration
wasthatnoman's hand butthine hadevertouched me;[295] andnow
here isamanwhohasseized hold ofmyhand !"But thebrahmin,
knowing thathewastricked, drove herfromhimwith blows.
Such,welearn, isthewickedness ofwomen. What crime willthey
notcommit ;andthen, todeceive their husbands, what oaths willtheynot
take—aye, inthelight ofday—thatthey did itnot !Sofalse-hearted are
they !Therefore has itbeen said:—
Asexcomposed ofwickedness and guile,

Asgreedily ascows seek pastures new.
