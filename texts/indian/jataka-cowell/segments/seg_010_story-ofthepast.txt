totheHimalayas withthousands ofbirds inhistrain. During their stay
inthat place, acertain fierce bird used togoinquest offood along a
highway where shefound rice, beans, andother grain dropped bypassing
waggons. Casting abouthow best tokeep theothers fromcoming there
too,sheaddressed them asfollows:—-"The highway isfullofperil.
Along itgoelephants and horses, waggons drawn byfierce oxen, and
such likedangerous things. And asitisimpossible totakewing onthe

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intothechaplain's family, andonhisfather's death
succeeded tothechaplaincy.
Now thekingpromised togrant whatsoever boon hisqueen should ask
ofliim,andshe said,—"Theboon Iask isaneasyone ;henceforth you

Accordingly, when hemarched outwith hishost, leaving theBodhisatta
inthecity, theking sentback amessenger attheendofevery league to
letthequeenknowhowhewas,and tofindouthowshefared. Ofeach
man ashecame sheasked what brought himback. Andoni-eceiving the
answer thathewascome tolearnhowshefared, thequeen beckoned the
messenger toherandsinned with him.Now thekingjounieyed twoand
thirty leagues andsenttwoandthirty messengers [438], andthequeen
sinned withthem all.Andwhen hehad pacified the frontier, tothe
great joy oftheinhabitants, hestarted onhishomeward journey, de-
spatching asecond series ofthirty-two messengers. And thequeen mis-
behaved with eachoneofthese, asbefore. Halting hisvictorious army
near thecity, tlieking sent aletter totheBodhisatta toprepare thecity
forhisentry. Thepreparations inthecitywere done, andtheBodhisatta
waspreparing thepalace fortheking's arrival, when hecame tothequeen's
apartments. Thesight ofhisgreat beauty somoved thequeen that she
called tohim tosatisfy her lust. ButtheBodliisatta pleaded with her,
urging thekijig's honour, andprotesting thatheshrank from allsinand
would notdoasshewished. "No thoughts oftheking frightened sixty-
four oftheking's messengers," said she;"and willyou fortheking's
sake feartodomywill 1"
Said theBodhisatta, "Had these messengers thought with me,they
would nothave acted thus. Asformethatknow theright, Iwillnot
commit this sin."
"Don't talk nonsense," said she. "Ifyou refuse, Iwillhave your
headchopped off."
"Sobeit.Cut offmyhead intliisorinahundred thousand exist-
ences;yetwill Inotdoyour l)idding."
"Allright ;Iwill see," said thequeen menacingly. And retiring to
herchamber, shescratched herself, i)ut oilonherlimbs, clad herself in
dirty clothes andfeigned tobeill.Then shesent forherslaves andbade
them telltheking,when heshould askafter her,thatshewas ill.
Meantime theBodliisatta hadgone tomeet the king, who, after
marching round thecity insolemn procession, entered hispalace. Not
seeing thequeen, hea.sked where shewas,andwas told thatshewas ill.
Entering theroyal bed-chamber, theking caressed thequeen andasked
what ailed her. Shewassilent ;butwhen thekingasked thethird time,
shelooked athimand said, "Though mylord theking still lives, yet
poorwomen likemehave toownamaster."
"What doyoumean ?"
"Thechaplain whom you lefttowatch over thecitycame hereon
pretence ofseeing after thepalace ;andbecause Iwould notyield tohis
will, [439] hebeatmetohisheart's content andwent off."

Then thekingfumed with rage, likethecrackling ofsaltorsugar in

them bind thechaplain with hishands behind hixn, likeonecondemned
todeath, andcutoffhishead attheplace ofexecution. Soaway they
hurried andbound theBodhisatta. And thedrumwasbeaten toannounce
theexecution.
Thought theBodhisatta, "Doubtless thatwicked queen hasalready
poisoned theking's mind against me,andnowmust Isavemyself from
this peril." Sohesaid tohiscaptors, "Bringmeintotheking's presence
before you slayme.""Why so?" said they. "Because, astheking's
servant, Ihave toiled greatly ontheking's business, andknow where great
treasures arehidden which Ihave discovered. IfIamnotbrought before
theking, allthiswealth willbelost. Soleadmetohim,andthen do
your duty."
Accordingly, they brought him before theking, who asked why
reverence hadnotrestrained himfrom such wickedness.
"Sire," answered theBodhisatta, "Iwasborn abrahmin, andhave
never taken the lifesomuch asofanemmet orant. Ihave never taken
whatwasnotmyown, even toablade ofgrass. Never have Ilooked
with lustful eyesupon another man's wife. Noteven injesthave I

Then theking ordered offallthesixty-four tobebeheaded.
But atthispoint [440] theBodhisatta cried out,"Nay, sire,themen

pardon them. And asforthequeen:—she isnottoblame, forthe
jjassions ofwomen areinsatiate, andshedoes butactaccording toher

Upon thisentreaty thekingwasmerciful, andsotheBodhisatta saved

"Sire, thebaseless accusations offolly putthewise inunmerited bonds,

grew abeautiful Wishing Tree (also called theMukkhaka) with straight

Here dwelt onewhohadbeen amighty deva-king andhadbeenreborn a

andthat pillar grew sbaky. Being told ofthis, theking sent forcar-
penters andordered them toput inasound pillar andmake itsecure.
Sothecarpenters [442] looked about foratree thatwould doand, not
finding oneelsewhere, went tothepleasaunce andsawtheMukkhaka.
Then away theywent back totheking. "Well," said he,"have you
found atreethat willdol" "Yes, sire," saidthey;"butwedon't liketo
fell it.""Why not?" saidtheking. Then they toldhimhowtheyhad
invainlooked everywhere foratreeanddidnot dai"e tocutdown the
sacred ti'ee. "Goandcut itdown," said he,"andmake theroof secure.
Iwilllookoutforanother tree."
Sotheywent away. And theytook asacrifice tothepleasaunce and
offered ittothe tree, saying among themselves thattheywould comeand
cut itdown next day. Hearing their words, theTree-sprite knew that
herhome would bedestroyed onthemorrow, andburst into tears asshe
clasped herchildren toherbreast, notknowing whither toflywiththem.
Her friends, thespirits ofthe forest, came andasked what thematter
was. Butnotoneofthem could devise how tostaythecarpenters' hand,
and allembraced herwith tearsandlamentations. Atthismoment up
came theBodhisatta tocallupon theTree-sprite andwas told thenews.
"Have nofear," saidtheBodhisatta cheerfully. "Iwill seethat thetree
isnotcutdown. Only waitand seewhat Iwilldowhen thecarpenters
come to-morrow."
Next daywhen themencame, theBodhisatta, assuming theshape ofa
chameleon, wasatthetreebefore they were, andgotinattherootsand
worked hiswayup tillhegotoutamong thebranches, making thetree
look full ofholes. Then theBodhisatta rested among theboughs with
hishead rapidly moving toand fro.Upcame thecarpenters; and at
sight ofthechameleon their leader struck thetreewith hishand, and
exclaimed that thetreewasrotten andthat they didn't look carefully
before making their offerings theday before. And offhewent full of
scorn forthegreat strong tx"ee. Inthisway theBodhisatta saved the
Tree-sprite's home. Andwhen allherfriends [443] andacquaintances

"Away with you, then," said theking. And hegotdown from the
elephant, making themahout mount instead, andwent himself tothe
foot ofthemountain, whilst themahout rodeontheelephant's backup
tothe to2)ofMount Vepulla. Thekingwith hiscourtiers alsoclimbed
themountain, andhadtheelephant halted atthebrink ofapreci])ice,
"Now," saidhetotheman, "ifheissowell trained asyousay,makehim
stand onthree legs."
And themahout ontheelephant's back justtouched theanimal with
hisgoadbyway ofsignand called tohim,"Hi!mybeauty, stand on
three legs." "Now makehimstand onhistwo fore-legs," saidtheking.
And theGreat Being raised hishind-legs andstood onhisfore-legs alone.
"Now onthehind-legs," saidtheking, andtheobedient elephant raised
hisfore-legs tillhestood onhishind-legs alone. "Now ononeleg," said
theking, andtheelephant stood onone leg.
Seeing thattheelephant didnot fallover theprecipice, theking cried,
"Now ifyoucan,makehimstand intheair."
Then thought themahout tohimself, "All India cannot shew the
match ofthiselephant forexcellence oftraining. Surely thekingmust
want tomakehimtumble over theprecipice andmeet hisdeath." Sohe
whispered intheelephant's ear,"My son,thekingwants youtofallover

toBenares."
And theGreat Being, endowed ashewaswith themarvellous powers

thisstanza :—

272 TlieJdtaka. Book I.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn intoarichbrahmin's family, andwhen hegrew up,was
versed inallknowledge andwasaworld-renowned professor with five
hundred young brahmins toinstruct.
Atthetime ofourstory there wasamong theyoung brahmins one
whoalways had foolish notions inhisheadandalways saidthewrong
thing; hewasengaged with therestinlearning thescriptures asapupil,
butbecause ofhisfolly could notmaster them. Hewasthedevoted
attendant oftheBodhisatta andministered tohim likeaslave.
Now onedayafter supper theBodhisatta laidhimself onhisbedand
therewaswashed andperfumed bytheyoung brahmin onhands, feetand
back. And astheyouth turned togoaway, theBodhisatta said tohim,
"Prop upthefeetofmybedbefore yougo."And theyoimg brahmin
propped upthefeet ofthebedononeside allright, butcould notfind
anything toprop itupwithontheother side. Accordingly heused his
legasapi'opandpassed thenight so.When theBodhisatta gotupin
themorning andsawtheyoung brahmin, heasked whyhewas sitting
there. "Master," said theyoung man,"Icould notfindoneofthel)ed
supports; soI'vegotmylegunder toprop itupinstead."
Moved atthese words, theBodhisatta thought, "What devotion!
And tothink itshould come from theveriest dullard ofallmypupils.
YethowcanIimpart learning tohim?" And thethought came tohim
thatthebestwaywastoquestion theyoung brahmin onhisreturn from
gathering firewood and leaves, astosomething hehadseen ordone that
day;andthen toaskwhat itwas like. [448] "Fox-," thought themaster,
"this willleadhimontomaking comparisons andgiving reasons, andthe
continuous practice ofcomparing andreasoning onhispart willenable me
toimpart learning tohim."
Accordingly hesent fortheyoung manandtoldhimalways onhis
return from picking upfirewood andleaves tosaywhat hehadseen or
eaten ordrunk. And theyoung manpromised hewould. Sooneday
having seen asnake when outwith theother pupils picking upwood in
the forest, hesaid,"Master, Isawasnake." "What did itlook like?"
"Oh, like theshaft ofaplough." "That isavery good comparison.
Snakes areliketheshafts ofploughs," saidtheBodhisatta, whobegan to
have hopes thathemight atlastsucceed with hispupil.
Another daytheyoung brahmin sawanelephant intheforest and
told hismaster. "And what isanelephant like?" "Oh, liketheshaft of
aplough." Hismaster saidnothing, forhethought that, astheelephant's
trunk andtusks bore acertain resemblance totheshaft ofaplough,
perhaps hispupil's stupidity made himspeak thus generally (though he
wasthinking ofthetrunk inparticular), because ofhisinability togo
intoaccurate detail,

Athird dayhewasinvited toeatsugar-cane, andduly told hismaster.
"And what isasugar-cane like?" "Oh, like theshaft ofaplough."
"That isscarcely agood comparison," thought hismaster, but said
nothing. Another day, again, thepupils were invited toeatmolasses
with curds andmilk, and thistoowasduly reported. "And what are
curds andmilk like?""Oh, like theshaft ofaplough." Then the
master thought tohimself, "This young manwasperfectly right insaying
asnake wasliketheshaft ofaplough, andwasmore orlessright, though
not accurate, insaying anelephant and asugar-cane hadthesame
similitude. Butmilkandcurds (which arealways white incolour) take
theshape ofwhatever vessel they areplaced in;[449] andherehemissed
thecomparison entirely. This dullard willnever learn." Sosaying he
uttered thisstanza:—
Foruniversal application he
Employs aterm oflimited import.

said he,"that thisBrother hasbeen regular inthefulfilment ofduties. Indays
gonebyfivehundred hermits going outtogather fruits were supported onthe
fruits that hisgoodness provided." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin intheNorth, and,growing iip,gaveup
theworld anddwelt atthehead offivehundred hermits atthefoot ofthe
mountains. Inthose days therecame agreat drought upon theHimalaya
country, andeverywhere thewater wasdried up,and sore distress fell
upon allbeasts. Seeing thepoor creatures suffering from thirst, one of
thehermits cutdown atreewhich hehollowed intoatrough;and this
trough hefilled with allthewater hecould find. Inthiswayhegave
theanimals todrink. Andtheycame inherds anddrank anddrank till
thehermit hadnotime lefttogoandgather fruits forhimself. Heed-
lessofhisownhunger, heworked away toquench theanimals' thirst.

agreed todo,every animal thatcame bringing mangoes orjambus or
bread-fruits orthelike, tilltheir ofierings would have filled twohundred
and fiftywaggons ;andtherewasfood forthewhole fivehundred hermits
withabundance tospare. Seeing this, theBodhisatta exclaimed, "Thus

hermits. Truly, weshould always bestedfast inright-doing." Sosaying,
heuttered thisstanza:—
Toil on,mybrother ;still inhope stand fast;

"Ifhe'mid strangers."—This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aboastful Brother. Theintroductory story about him islikewhat has
been already related ^
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenai'es, the
Bodhisatta wasarichTreasurer, andhiswife borehimason. Aiid the
selfsame dayafemale slave inhishouse gave birth toaboy,andthetwo
children gi-ew uptogether. Andwhen the richman's sonwasbeing
taught towrite, theyoimg slave used togowith hisyoung master's
tablets andsolearned atthesame time towrite himself. Next helearned
twoorthree handicrafts, andgrew vxptobeafair-spoken andhandsome
young man ;and hisname wasKatahaka. Being employed asprivate
secretary, hethought tohimself, "Ishall notalways bekept atthis
work. The slightest fault and Ishall bebeaten, imprisoned, branded,
andfedonslave's fare. Ontheborder there lives amerchant, afriend of
mymaster's. Why should Inotgotohimwith aletter purporting to
come frommymaster, and,passing myself offasmymaster's son,marry
themerchant's daughter and livehappily everafterwards %"
Sohewrote aletter, [452] saying, "The bearer ofthis ismyson. It
ismeet that ourhouses should beunited inmarriage, andIwould have
yougiveyourdaughter tothismysonandkeep theyoung couple nearyou
forthepresent. Assoon asIcanconveniently doso,Iwillcome toyou."
This letter hesealed with hismaster's private seal,andcame totheborder-
merchant's with awell-filled purse, handsome dresses, andperfumes and
the like.And with abowhestood before themerchant. "Where do
youcome from?" saidthemerchant. "From Benares." "Who isyour
father]" "TheTreasurer ofBenares." "And what brings youhere?"
"This letter will tellyou," saidKatahaka, handing ittohim. The
merchant readtheletter andexclaimed, "This givesmenew life."And
inhisjoyhegave hisdaughter toKatahaka and setuptheyoung couple,
who lived ingreat style. ButKatahaka gave himself airs,andused to
findfault with thevictuals andtheclothes thatwere brought him, calling
them "provincial." "These misguided provincials," hewould say, "have

noidea ofdressing. And asfortaste inscents andgarlands, they've got
none."
Missing hisslave, theBodhisatta said, "Idon't seeKatahaka. Where
hashegone 1Find him." And offwent theBodhisatta's people inquest
ofhim,andsearched farandwide tilltheyfound him. Then back they
came, without Katahaka recognizing them, andtoldtheBodhisatta.
"This willnever do," saidtheBodhisatta onhearing thenews. "I
willgoandbring himback." Soheasked theKing's permission, and
departed with agreat following. And thetidings spread everywhere that
theTreasurer wasonhiswaytotheborders. Hearing thenewsKatahaka
felltothinking ofhiscourse ofaction. Heknew thathewasthesole
reason oftheTreasurer's coming, andhesawthat torunawaynowwas to
destroy allchance ofreturning. Sohedecided togotomeet theTreasurer,
andconciliate himbyacting asaslave towards him asintheolddays.
Acting onthisplan, hemade apoint ofproclaiming in[453] public onall
occasions hisdisapprobation ofthelamentable decay ofrespect towards
parents which shewed itself inchildren's sitting down tomeals with their
parents, instead ofwaiting upon them. ""Whenmyparents take their
meals," saidKatahaka, "Ihand theplates anddishes, bring thespittoon,
andfetch their fans forthem. Such ismyinvariable practice." Andhe
explained carefully aslave's duty tohismaster, such asbringing thewater
andministering tohimwhen heretired. And having already schooled
folk ingeneral, hehadsaid tohisfather-in-law shortly before thearrival of
theBodhisatta, "Ihearthatmyfather iscoming toseeyou.Youhadbetter
make ready toentertain him,while Iwillgoandmeethimontheroad
with apresent." "Doso,mydear boy," said hisfather-in-law.
SoKatahaka took amagnificent present andwent outwith alarge
retinue tomeet theBodhisatta, towhom hehanded thepresent with alow
obeisance. TheBodhisatta took thepresent inakindly way, and at
breakfast timemade hisencampment and retired forthepurposes of
nature. Stopping hisretinue, Katahaka tookwater andapproached the
Bodhisatta. Then theyoung man fellattheBodhisatta's feetand cried,
"Oh, sir,Iwillpayanysumyoumayrequire;butdonotexpose me."
"Fearnoexposure atmyhands," saidtheBodhisatta, pleased athis
dutiful conduct, andentered intothe city,where hewasfeted with great
magnificence. AndKatahaka stillacted ashisslave.
AstheTreasurer satathisease, theborder-merchant said,"My Lord,
upon receipt ofyour letter Idulygavemydaughter inmarriage toyour
son." And theTreasurer made asuitable reply about 'hisson' inso
kindly awaythat themerchant wasdelighted beyond measure. Butfrom
thattime forth theBodhisatta could notbear thesight ofKatahaka.
OnedaytheGreat Being sent forthemerchant's daughter and said,
"Mydear, please lookmyhead over." Shedid so,andhethanked herfor

hermucli-needed services, [454] adding, "And now tellme,mydear,
whether myson isareasonable man inwealandwoe,andwhether you
manage togetonwellwithhim."
"Myhusband hasonlyone fault. Hewillfind fault with hisfood."
"He hasalways hadhisfaults,mydear; butIwill tellyouhow to
stop histongue. Iwill tellyouatextwhich youmust learn carefully and
repeat toyourhusband when hefinds fault again with hisfood." Andhe
taught herthelinesandshortly afterwards setoutforBenares. Katahaka
accompanied hirapart oftheway,andtook hisleave after offering most
valuable presents totheTreasurer. Dating from thedeparture ofthe
Bodhisatta, Katahaka waxed prouder andprouder. Oneday hiswife
ordered anice dinner, andbegan tohelphim toitwith aspoon, butat
the firstmouthful Katahaka began togrumble. Thereon themerchant's
daughter i-emembering herlesson, repeated thefollowing stanza :—
Ifhe'mid strangers farfromhome talks big^,
Back comes hisvisitor tospoil itall.—Come, eatyour dinner then, Katahaka^.
"Dearme,"thought Katahaka, "theTreasurer must haveinformed her
ofmyname, andhave toldherthewhole story." And from thatday
forth hegave himself uomore airs,buthuDibly atewhat was setbefore
him,andathisdeath passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

"What uprightness!"thought theBodhisatta, andthenceforward he
made apoint ofgoing, attended bytheother rats, topayhisrespects morn-
ingandevening tothesaintly jackal. Andwhen theratswere leaving,
thejackal seized anddevoured thehindermost oneofthem, wiped his lips,
andlooked asthough nothing hadhappened. Inconsequence ofthisthe
ratsgrew fewer andfewer, tillthey noticed thegaps intheir ranks, and
wondering why thiswas so,asked theBodhisatta thereason. Hecould
notmake itout,butsuspecting thejackal, [461] resolved toputhim to
the test. Sonext dayhelettheother ratsgoout firstandhimself
brought upthe reai*. Thejackal made aspring ontheBodhisatta who,
seeing himcoming, faced round and cried, "Sothis isyour saintliness,
youhypocrite andrascal !"Andherepeated thefollowing stanza:—
Where saintliness isbutacloak
Whereby tocozen guileless folk
And screen avillain's treachery,—The cat-like nature thex^e wesee^.
Sosaying, theking oftheratssprang atthejackal's throat and bithis

other ratsandgobbled upthebody ofthejackal witha'crunch, crunch,

peace andquiet.
His lesson ended, theMaster made theconnection bysaying, "This hypo-

Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattawasKing oftheRatsanddwelt intheforest. Now afirebroke out
intheforest, andajackal whocould notrunaway puthishead against a
tree[462] and lettheflames sweep byhim. The tiresinged thehair otF
hisbody everywhere, and lefthim perfectly bald, except foratuft likea
scalp- knot^ where thecrown ofhisheadwas pressed against the tree.
Drinking onedayinarocky pool,hecaught sight ofthistop-knot reflected
inthewater. "At lastI'vegotwherewithal togotomarket," thought he.
Coming inthecourse ofhiswanderings intheforest totherats' cave, he
said tohimself, "I'llhoodwink those ratsanddevour them;" andwith this
intent hetookuphisstand hard by,just asintheforegoing story.
Onhiswayoutinquest offood, theBodhisatta observed thejackal
and, crediting thebeast with virtue andgoodness, came tohimandasked
what hisname was.
"Bharadvaja-, Votary oftheFire-God."
"Why haveyoucome here?"
"Inorder toguard youandyours."
"What willyoudotoguard us?"
"Iknowhow tocount onmyAngers, and willcount yournumbers
bothmorning andevening, soastobesure that asmany camehome at

"Then stay, uncle, andwatch over us."
And accordingly, astheratswere starting inthemorning hesetabout
counting them "One, two,three;" and soagainwhen theycame back at
night. Andevery time hecounted them, heseized andatethehindmost.
Everything came topass asintheforegoing story, except thathere the

"What isthematter with you,mydear?" saidherhusband.
"Wind troubles me."
"What can Igetforyou?"
"Sweets, savouries, rich food, rice-gi'uel, boiled-rice, oil,andsoforth."
Theobedient husband didasshewished, andtoiled likeaslave forher. She

"Mypoorwifedoesn't seem togetanybetter ofthewind," thought thebrahmin
atlast,andbetook himself with offerings ofpeifumes, flowers, andthe like, to
theMaster atJetavana. Hisobeisance done, hestood before theBlessed One,

Benares. Tohim flocked aspupils theyoung nobles andbrahmins from
alltheprincely andwealthy families. Now acountry brahmin, whohad
learned from theBodhisatta thethree Vedas, andtheeighteen Sciences,
andwhostopped oninBenares tolook after hisestate, came two or
three times every daytolisten totheBodhisatta's teachings. [464] And
thisbrahmin hadawifewhowasabad,wicked woman. And everything
came topass asabove. When thebrahmin explained how itwasthathe
could notgetaway tolisten tohismaster's teachings, theBodhisatta, who
knew that thebrahmin's wifewasonly feigning sickness, thought tohim-
self,"Iwill tellhimwhat physic willcure thecreature." Sohesaid to
thebrahmin, "Get hernomore dainties, myson,butcollect thestalings

oftheir talk. "Brethren," said he,"this isnotthe firsttime thatDevadatta has
been ungrateful; hewasjustasungrateful inbygone days." Sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
[4G6] Once onatime,when acertain king ofMagadha wasreigning in
Rfijagaha, theBodbisatta was hisTreasurer, worth eighty ci'ores, and
known asthe 'Millionaire.' InBenares there dwelt aTreasurer also
worth eighty crores, whowasnamed Piliya, andwasagreat friend ofthe
Millionaire. Forsome reason orother Piliya ofBenares gotinto difficiilties,
and lost allhisproperty, andwasreduced tobeggary. Inhisneedheleft
Benares, andwith hiswifejourneyed onfoot toBajagaha, toseethe
Millionaire, thelasthope lefthim.And theMillionaire embraced his
friend andtreated him asanhonoured guest, asking, induecourse, the
reason ofthevisit. "Iamaruined man," answered Piliya, "Ihave lost
everything, andhavecome toaskyoutohelpme."
"With allmyheart !Have nofearonthat score," saidtheMillionaire.
Hehad hisstrong-room opened, andgave toPiliya forty crores. Alsohe
divided intotwoequal parts thewhole ofhisproperty, livestock and all,
andbestowed onPiliya thejust half ofhisentire fortune. Taking his
wealth, Piliya wentback toBenares, andthere dwelt.
Notlong after alikecalamity overtook theMillionaire, who, inhis
turn, lostevery penny hehad. Casting aboiit whither toturn inthehour
ofneed, hebethought himhowhehadbefriended Piliya tothehalf ofhis
possessions, andmight gotohim forassistance without fearofbeing thi-own
over. Sohesetoutfrom Rajagaha with hiswife,andcame toBenares.
Attheentrance tothecityhesaid toher,"Wife, itisnotbefitting for
you totrudge along thestreets with me.Wait here alittle tillIsend

saying, heleftherunder shelter, andwent onalone into thetown, till
hecame toPiliya's house, where hebade himself beannounced asthe
Millionaire from Rajagaha, come toseehisfriend.
"Well, showhim in,"saidPiliya; butatsight oftheother's condition

fortunate friend halfa-quartern ofpollard tocarryaway tiedupinthe

nowdoled outhalf-a-quartern ofpollard tohisbenefactor !Accordingly,
theservant measured outthepollard inabasket, andbrought ittothe
Bodhisatta, whoargued within himself whether ornoheshould take it.And
hethought, "This ingrate breaks offour fi-iendship because Iamaruined
man. Now, ifIrefuse hispaltry gift, Ishallbeasbadashe.Forthe
ignoble, whoscorn amodest gift,outrage the firstidea offriendship. Be

hisway 1)ack towhere hehadhoused hiswife.
"What haveyougot,dearl" said she.
"Our friend Piliya gives usthispollard, andwashes hishands ofus."
"Oh,why didyoutake if? Isthis afitreturn fortheforty

"Don't cry,dear wife," saidtheBodhisatta. "Itook itsimply because
Iwanted not toviolate theprinciple offriendship. Why these tears?"

former mistress. Recognising hismaster and mistress, hefellattheir

Bodhisatta toldhimtheir story.
"Keep upyour spirits," said theman, cheei'ily; and,taking them to
hisown dwelling, theremade ready perfumed baths, andameal forthem.
Then helettheother slaves know that their oldmaster andmistress had

"Isthissol" saidtheking toPiliya.
"Yes, sire," said he.
"And when, inhistui'n, your benefactor confided inyouandsought

Here Piliya was silent.
"Did youhave ahalf-quartern ofpollard doled outintothecorner of

[469] Still Piliya was silent.
Then theking took counsel with hisministers astowhat should be
done, and finally, asajudgment onPiliya, ordered them togotoPiliya's
house andgivethewhole ofPiliya's wealth totheMillionaire.
"Nay, sire," saidtheBodhisatta;"Ineed notwhat isanother's. Let

Entering the city theBodhisatta passed into thespacious hall ofthe

glittering splendour stood hisministers andbrahmins and nobles, whilst
sixteen thousand nautch girls, fairasthenymphs ofheaven, sangand
danced andmade music, tillthepalace wasloud with sounds likethe
ocean when thestorm Inirsts inthunder onitswaters^. Gazing round
onthepomp ofhisroyal state, theBodhisatta thought how,hadhelooked
upon thecharms oftheogresses, hewould have perished miserably, nor
everhave lived toseehispresent magnificence, which heowed tohis
following thecounsels ofthePacceka Buddlias. And asthese thoughts
filled hisheart, hisemotion found vent inthese verses:

readily undertook tobuildhimanother hut. But, inspite oftheir protestations,
threemonths slipped away without itsbeing rebuilt. Having noroof toshelter

Light hadbeenvouchsafed tohimwhen attheclose oftherainy season hewent
back toJetavana andstood respectfully before theMaster. Inthecourse of
talktheMaster asked whether theBrother's meditation hadbeen successful.
Then thatBrother related from thebeginning thegoodand illthathad be-
fallen him. SaidtheMaster, "Indaysgone by,even brute beasts could discern
between whatwasgoodandwhat bad forthem andsoquitted betimes, erethey
proved dangerous, thehabitations thathadsheltered them inhappier days.
And ifbeasts were sodiscerning, howcould you fallsof;irshort ofthem in

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenai-es, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abird.When hecame toyears ofdiscretion, good
fortune attended himandhebecame king ofthebirds, taking uphis
abode with hissubjects inagiant treewhich stretched itsleafy branches
over thewaters ofalake.And allthese birds, [472] roosting inthe
boughs, dropped theirdung intothewaters below. Now that lakewas

ofhiswater and resolved totake vengeance onthe birds andburn
them out. Soonenightwhen theywere allroosting along thebranches,

hecaused smoke toarise, andthirdly hemade flames dartupashigh

Seeing theflames shooting upfrom thewater, theBodhisatta cried to
thebirds, "Water isused toquench fire;buthere isthewater itself on
fire. This isnoplace forus; letusseek ahome elsewhere." Sosaying,
heuttered thisstanza:—
