sitting down. Likewise, those disciples ofother schools saluted theBuddha, and
took their seats closebythesideofAnatha-pindika,— gazing upon theMaster's
countenance, glorious asthefullmoon, upon hisexcellent presence endowed with
thesigns andmarks ofBuddhahood andencompassed toafathom's length with
light, "andupon therichglory thatmarks aBuddha, aglory which issued asit
were inpaired garlands, pairupon pair.
Then, though inthunderous tones asofayoung lionroaring intheRed
Valley orasofastorm-cloud intherainy season, bringing down asitwere the
Ganges oftheHeavens ^[96]andseeming toweave achaplet ofjewels,—yetina
voice ofeightfold perfection, thecharm ofwhich ravished theear,hepreached
tothem theTruth inadiscourse fullofsweetness and bright with varied
beauty.
They, after hearing theMaster's discourse, roseupwith hearts converted,
andwithduesalutation totheLord ofKnowledge, burst asunder theother
doctrines inwhich theyhadtaken refuge, andbetook themselves totheBuddha as
their refuge. Thenceforth without ceasing theyused togowithAnatha-pindika,
carrying intheirhands perfumes andgarlands andthelike, tohear theTruth in
theMonastery ;andtheyabounded incharity, kept theCommandments, andkept
theweekly fast-day.
Now theBlessed Onewentfrom Savatthi back toRajagaha again. Assoon
astheBuddha hadgone, theyburst asunder theirnew faith, andreturning to
theother doctrines astheir refuge, reverted totheir original state.
After some seven oreight months' stay, theBlessed Onecame back to
Jetavana. Once again toodidAnatha-pindika come with those friends ofhisto
theMaster, make hissalutation and offering ofperfumes andthelike,andtake
hisseatonone side.And thefriends alsosaluted theBlessed Oneandtook
their seats inlikemanner. Then didAnatha-pindika telltheBlessed Onehow,
when theBuddha haddeparted onhisalms-pilgrimage, hisfriends hadforsaken
their refuge fortheolddoctrines again, andhad reverted totheir original
state.
Opening thelotus ofhismouth, asthough itwereacasket ofjewels, scented
with scents divine and filled with divers perfumes byvirtue ofhishaving ever
spoken aright throiighoiit myriad feons, theBlessed Onemade hissweet voice
come forth, asheenquired:—"Isthereport truethatyou, disciples, haveforsaken
theThree Refuges ^fortherefuge ofother doctrines?"
Andwhen they, unable toconceal thefact,hadconfessed, saying, "It istrue.
Blessed One," then saidtheMaster, "Disciples, notbetween thebounds ofhelP
below andthehighest heaven above, notinalltheinfinite worlds that stretch
right and left, isthere theequal, much lessthesuperior, ofaBuddha inthe
excellences which spring from obeying theCommandments andfrom other
virtuous conduct."
Then hedeclared tothem theexcellences oftheThree Gems asthey are
revealed inthesacred texts, thefollowing amongst thenumber,—"Of allcreatures,
Brethren, whether footless &c.,ofthese theBuddha isthechief"; "Whatsoever
riches there beinthisorinother worlds &c."; and"Verily thechief ofthe
faithful &c." Thence hewent ontosay:—"No disciples, male orfemale, who
seek refuge intheThreeGems that areendowed with such peerless excellences,
areever reborn into hellandthelike states ;but, released from allrebirth
into states ofsuffering, they pass totheRealm ofDevas andthere receive great
glory. Therefore, inforsaking such arefuge forthat offered byother doctrines,
youhavegone astray."

(And herethefollowing sacred texts should becited tomake itclear that

ButtheMaster didnotendhisteaching tothem atthispoint ;forhewent
ontosay:—"Disciples, meditation onthethought oftheBuddha, meditation on
thethought oftheTruth, meditation onthethought oftheBrotherhood, this it
isthat givesEntry toandFruition oftheFirst, theSecond, theThird, andthe
Fourth Paths toBliss ^."Andwhen hehadpreached theTruth tothem inthese
andother ways, hesaid,"Inforsaking such arefuge asthis,youhave gone
astray."
(And herethegiftoftheseveral Paths tothosewhomeditate onthethought
oftheBuddha and sofoi-tli, should bemade clearbysuch scriptures asthe
following:—"One thing there is.Brethren, w4iich, ifpractised anddeveloped,
conduces toutter loathing oftheworld's vanities, tothecessation ofpassion, to
theendofbeing, topeace, toinsight, toenlightenment, toNirvana. What is
thisonething ?—Themeditation onthethought oftheBuddha.")
When hehadthus exhorted thedisciples, theBlessed One said,—"Sotooin
times past, disciples, themenwhojimiped tothefatuous conclusion thatwhat
wasnorefuge wasarealrefuge, fellaprey togoblins inademon-haunted wilder-
nessandwere utterly destroyed;whilst themenwho clave totheabsolute
andindisputable truth, prospered intheselfsame wilderness." Andwhen he
hadsaid this,hebecame silent.
Then, rising upfrom hisseatandsaluting theBlessed One, thelayman
Anatha-pindika burst into praises, andwith clasped hands raised inreverence to
hisforehead, spoke thus:—"It isclear tous,Sir,that inthese present days
these disciples were ledbyerror into forsaking thesupreme refuge. Butthe
bygone destruction ofthose opinionated ones intliedemon-haiuited wilderness,
andtheprospering ofthemenwho clave tothe trvith, arehidden from usand
known only toyou. [98]May itplease theBlessed One, asthough causing the
fullmoon toriseinthesky, tomake thisthing clear tous."

Then said theBlessed One:—"Itwas solely tobrush away theworld's
difficulties thatbythedisplay oftheTen Perfections^through myriad aeons
Iwonomniscience. Give earandhearken, asclosely asifyouwere filling atube
ofgoldwith lion's marrow."
"Having thus excited theTreasurer's attention, hemade clear thething that
re-birth hadconcealed from them, asthough hewere releasing the fullmoon
from theupper air,thebirthplace ofthesnows.
Onceonatime inthecityofBenares intheKasi country there was
akingnamed Brahmadatta. Inthose days theBodhisatta wasborn into
amerchant's family, andgrowing upinduecourse, used tojourney about
trading with fivehundred carts, travelling nowfrom east towestand
nowfromwest toeast. There was also atBenai-es another young mer-
chant, astupid blockhead, lacking resource.
Now atthetime ofourstory theBodhisatta hadloaded fivehundred
carts with costly wares ofBenares andhadgotthem allready tostart.
And sohadthefoolish young merchant too. Thought theBodhisatta,
"If this foolish young merchant keepsmecompany allalong, andthe
thousand carts travel along together, itwillbetoomuch fortheroad ;it
willbeahard matter togetwood, watei*, and soforth forthemen, or
grass fortheoxen. Either heorImust goonfirst." Sohesent forthe
other and laid hisview before him, saying, "The two ofuscan't travel
together; would yourather gofirstorlasf?" Thought theother, "There
willbemany advantages ifIgoonfirst. Ishallhave aroadwhich isnot
yetcutup ;myoxen willhave thepick ofthegrass ;mymen willhave
thepick oftheherbs forcurry ;thewater willbeundisturbed ;and,
lastly, Ishall fixmyown price forthebarter ofmygoods." Accordingly
hereplied, "Iwillgofirst,mydear sir." [99]
TheBodhisatta, ontheother hand, sawmany advantages ingoing last,
forheargued thus tohimself:—"Those whogofirst will level theroad
where itisrough, whilst Ishall travel along theroad theyhave already
travelled; their oxen willhave grazed offthecoarse oldgrass, whilst
mine willpasture onthesweet young growth which willspring upinits
place ;mymen willfindafreshgrowth ofsweet herbs forcurry where the
oldoneshavebeenpicked ;whei'e there isnowater, the firstcaravan will
have todigtosupply themselves, andweshall drink atthewells they
dug. Haggling over prices iskilling work ;whereas I,following later,
shall bartermywares attheprices theyhave already fixed." Accordingly,
seeing allthese advantages, hesaid totheother, "Then goyou first,my
dear sir."

loving-kindness, andequanimity. (See theCariyd Pitaka, pp.45—7ofthePali text

"Very well, Iwill," said thefoolish merchant. Ami heyoked his
carts and setout. Journeying along, helefthuman habitations behind
himandcame totheoutskirts ofthewilderness. (Now wildernesses areof
thefivefollowing kinds:—robber wildernesses, wild-beast wildernesses,
drought wildernesses, demon wildernesses, andfamine wildernesses. The
first iswhen theway isbeset byrobbers ;thesecond iswhen theway is
besetbylionsandother wild beasts ;thethird iswhen there isnobathing
orwater tobegot ;thefourth iswhen theroad isbeset bydemons ;and
the fifth iswhen noroots orother food aretobefound. And inthis
fivefold category thewilderness inquestion wasboth adrought, anda
demon, wilderness.) Accordingly thisyoung merchant took great big
water-jars onhis carts, and filling them with water, setout tocross
thesixty leagues ofdesert which laybefore him.Nowwhen hehad
reached themiddle ofthewilderness, thegoblin whohaunted itsaid
tohimself, "Iwillmake thesementhrow away their stock ofwater, and
devour them allwhen they arefaint." Sohe[100] framed byhismagic
power adelightful carriage drawn bypure white young bulls. With a
retinue ofsome tenortwelve goblins bearing bows and quivers, swords
andshields, herodealong tomeetthem likeamighty lordinthiscarriage,
with blue lotuses andwhite water-lilies wreathed round hishead, withwet
hairandwet clothes, andwithmuddy carriage- wheels. Hisattendants,
too,infrontandrearofhimwent along with their hairandclothes wet,
with garlands ofblue lotuses andwhite water-lilies ontheir heads, and
withbunches ofwhite lotuses intheir hands, chewing theesculent stalks,
anddripping withwater andmire.Now theleaders ofcaravans have the
following custom :whenever thewind blows intheir teeth, they rideon
infront intheir carriage with their attendants round them, inorder to
escape thedust ;butwhen thewind blows from behind them, then they
ride inlikefashion intherear ofthecolumn. And, asonthisoccasion
thewind wasblowing against them, theyoung merchant wasriding in
front. When thegoblin became aware ofthemerchant's approach, he
drew hiscarriage aside from thetrack andgreeted himkindly, asking him
whither hewasgoing. Theleader ofthecaravan toocaused hiscarriage to
bedrawn aside from thetrack soastoletthecarts pass by,whilst he
stayed bythewayandthus addressed thegoblin :"We arejustonour
wayfrom Benares, sir.But Iobserve thatyouhave lotuses andwater-
liliesonyour heads andinyour hands, andthatyour people arechewing
theesculent stalks, andthatyouare allmuddy anddripping with wet.
Pray did itrainwhile youwere ontheroad, anddidyoucome onpools
covered with lotuses andwater-lilies?"
Hereon thegoblin exclaimed, "What didyousay? Why, yonder
appears thedark-green streak ofthe forest, andthence onward there is
nothing butwater allthrough theforest. Itisalways raining there;the

pools arefull ;andonevery sidearelakes covered with lotuses andwater-
lilies." Then asthelineofcarts [101] passed by,heasked where they
werebound fox-."Tosuchandsuchaplace," wasthereply. "And what
wares haveyougotinthiscartandinthisV"Soand so.""And what
might youhave inthis lastcartwhich seems tomove asifitwere heavilj'
laden?" "Oh, there's water inthat." "You didwell tocarry water with
youfrom theother side. Butthere isnoneed for itnow, aswater is
abundant onahead. Sobreak thejarsandthrow thewater away, that
youmay travel easier." Andheadded, "Now continue onyourway, as
wehave stopped toolong already." Then hewent alittlewayfurther on,
tillhewasoutofsight, when hemade hiswayback tothegoblin-city
where hedwelt.
Such wasthefolly ofthat foolish merchant thathedidthegoblin's
bidding, andhadhisjarsbroken andthewater allthrown away,—without
saving somuch even aswould gointhepalm ofaman's hand. Then he
ordered thecarts todrive on.Not adrop ofwater didthey findon
ahead, and thirst exhausted themen. Alldaylong tillthesunwent
down they keptonthemarch ;butatsunset theyunyoked their carts
andmade alaager, tethering theoxen tothewheels. Theoxenhadno
water todrink, andthemennone tocook their ricewith ;andthe tii'ed-
outband sank totheground toslumber. But assoon asnight fell,
thegoblins came outfrom their city,andslew every single oneofthose
menandoxen; andwhen theyhaddevoured their flesh, leaving only
thebare bones, thegoblins departed. Thus wasthefoolish young mer-
chant thesolecause ofthedestruction ofthatwhole band, whose skeletons
werestrewn inevery conceivable direction, whilst the fivehundred carts
stood there with their loads untouched.
Now theBodhisatta allowed some sixweeks topassbyafter the
starting ofthefoolish young mei'chant, before hesetout.Then hepro-
ceeded from the citywith hisfivehundred carts, and indue course
came totheoutskirts ofthewilderness. Here hehad hiswater-jars
tilled and laid inanample stock ofwater ;andbybeat ofdrum hehad
hismenassembled incamp [102], andthus addressed them:—"Let notso
much asapalmful ofwater beused without mysanction. There are
poison trees inthis wilderness; soletnomanamong youeatany leaf,
flower, orfruitwhich hehasnoteaten before, without firstasking me."
With thisexhortation tohismen, hejjushed onintothewilderness with
his500 carts. When hehadreached themiddle ofthewilderness, the
goblin made hisappearance ontheBodhisatta's path asintheformer case.
But, assoon ashebecame aware ofthegoblin, theBodhisatta sawthrough
him; forhethought tohimself, "There's nowater here, inthis'Waterless
Desert.' This person with hisredeyesandaggressive bearing, casts no
shadow. Very likely hehasinduced thefoolish young merchant who


No. 1. 7
preceded me,tothrow away all liiswater, andthen, waiting tilltheywere
worn out,haseaten upthemerchant with allhismen. Buthedoesn't
knowmycleverness andready wit." Then heshouted tothegoblin,
"Begone !We're men ofbusiness, anddonotthrow awaywhat water we
have got,before weseewhere more istocome from. But,whenwedosee
more,wemaybetrusted tothrow thiswater away andlighten ourcarts."
Thegoblin rodeonabitfurther tillhewasoutofsight, andthen
betook himself back tohishome inthedemon city. Butwhen thegoblin
hadgone, theBodhisatta's men said tohim, "Sir,weheard from those
men thatyonder isthedark-green streak oftheforest appearing, where
they said itwasalways raining. Theyhadgotlotuses ontheir heads and
water-lilies intheirhands andwere eating thestalks, whilst their clothes
andhairwere wringing wet,with water streaming offthem. Letusthrow
away ourwater andgetonabitquicker with lightened carts." Onhearing
these words, theBodhisatta ordered ahaltandhadthemen allmustered.
"Tell me," saidhe;"didanymanamong youever hear before today that
there wasalake orapool inthis wilderness'?" "No, sir,"was the
answer, "why it'sknown as'theWaterless Desert'."
"Wehave justbeen toldbysome people that itisraining justonahead,
inthebelt offorest; nowhow fardoes arain-wind carry /"[103]"A
league, sir." "Andhasthisrain-wind reached anyonemanhere1""No,
sir." "How far offcanyou seethe crest ofastorm-cloud?""A

ning?" "Four orfiveleagues, sir.""And hasanyoneman here seen
aHash oflightning?" "No, sir.""How faroffcanaman hear apeal

They willreturn inthehope ofdevom-ing uswhenweareweak andfaint
afterthrowing away ourwater attheir bidding. Astheyoung merchant
whowentonbefore uswasnotaman ofresource, most likely hehasbeen
fooled intothrowing hiswater away andhasbeendevoured when exhaus-
tionensued. Wemayexpect tofindhisfivehundred carts standing just
astheywere loaded forthestart ;weshallcome onthem today. Press on
with allpossible speed, without throwing away adrop ofwater."
Urging hismenforward with these words, heproceeded onhisway till
hecameupon the500carts standing justastheyhadbeenloaded andthe
skeletons ofthemenandoxen lying strewn inevery direction. Hehad
hiscartsunyoked andranged inacircle soastoform astrong laager ;he
sawthat hismenandoxenhadtheir supper early, andthattheoxenwere
made toliedown inthemiddle with themenround them ;andhehimself
with theleading menofhisbaud stood onguard, sword inhand, through

morrow atdaybreak when hehadhadhisoxen fedandeverything needful
done, hediscarded hisownweak carts forstronger ones, and hisown
common goods forthemost costly ofthederelict goods. Then hewenton
tohisdestination, where hebai-tered hisstock forwares oftwice orthree
times their value, andcame back tohisown citywithout losing asingle
manoutofallhiscompany.
[104] This story ended, theMaster said,"Thus itwas,layman, that in
times pastthefatuous came toutter destruction, whilst thosewhoclave tothe
truth, escaping from thedemons' hands, reached their goal insafety andcame
back totheirhomes again." Andwhen hehadthus linked thetwo stories
together, he,astheBuddha, spoke thefollowing stanza forthepurposes ofthis
lesson ontheTinith:—
Then some declared the sole, thepeerless truth;
Butotherwise thefalse logicians spake.
Lethimthat 'swisefrom thisalesson take,
And firmly grasp the sole, thepeerless truth.
[105] Thus didtheBlessed Oneteach thislesson respecting Truth. And
hewent ontosay:"What iscalled walking bytruth, notonly bestows the
threehappy endowments, thesixheavens oftherealms ofsense, andtheendow-
ments ofthehigher Realm ofBrahma, but finally isthegiver ofArahatship
[106]; whilst what iscalled walking byuntruth entails re-birth inthefour
states ofpunishment orinthelowest castes ofmankind." Further, theMaster
went ontoexpound insixteen ways theFour Truthsi,attheclose ofwhich all
those fivehundred disciples were established intheFruit oftheFirst Path2.
Having deUvered hislesson andhisteaching, andhaving toldthetwostories
andestablished theconnexion linking them together, theMaster concluded by
identifying theBirth asfollows:—"Devadatta wasthefoolish young merchant
ofthose days ;hisfollowers were thefollowers ofthatmerchant ;thefollowers of
theBuddha were thefollowers ofthewisemerchant, whowasmyself."
^These fourcardinal truths ofBuddhism areasfollows:—(i)individual existence
ispaiu; (ii)cravings cause thecontinuance ofindividual existence; (iii)with the
disappearance ofcravings, individual existence alsowould disappear; and (iv)cravings
disappear byfollowing theNoble Eightfold Path pointed outbytheBuddha. (See
hereon Rhys Davids' Hibbert Lecture for1881.)
"Thenormal road totheBuddhist ideal after conversion isdivided into four
successive stages, called thecattdro maggd or'four paths.' The firstofthese isthat
trodden bythesotdpanno (one'who hasentered thestream' which flowsdown tothe
ocean ofNirvana), who isassured ofultimately reaching hisgoal buthas first to
undergo seven more existences none ofwhich canbeinastate ofsuffering ;thesecond
path isthattrodden bythesakaddgdmi, thedisciple whose imperfections have been
sofareradicated thathehasonly to'return' toahuman-form oncemore before
attaining Nirvana ;thethird path isthat oftheanagdnu, thedisciple who will'not
return 'toearth, butwillattain thegoalfrom aBrahma realm;whilst thefourth and
last isArahatshiji, which isNirvana. Each ofthese four stages isfurther subdivided
intotwo sub-stages, thelower called 'the path,' andthehigher 'the fruit.' (See
Maha-parinibbana Sutta audthecommentary thereon oftheSumangala Vilasini.)

"Untiring, deep theyo?;/^."— This discourse wasdelivered bytheBlessed One
whilst hewasdwelling atSavatthi.
About wliom, youask ?
About aBrother whogaveuppersevering.
Tradition says that, whilst theBuddha wasdwelling atSavatthi, therecame
toJetavana ascion ofaSavatthi family, who, onhearing adiscourse bythe
IMaster, realised thatLusts breed suftering, andwasadmitted tothe firststage
oftheBrotherhood. After fiveyears passed inpreparing foradmission tofull
Brotherhood 1,when hehadlearnt twosummaries andhadtrained himself in
themethods ofInsight, heobtained from theMaster atheme formeditation
which commended itself tohim. Retiring toaforest, hepassed there the
rainy season ;but forallhisstriving during thethree months, hecould not
develope aglimmer oraninkling ofInsight. Sothethought came tohim,
"The Master said there were four types ofmen, and Imust belong tothe
lowest ofall; inthis birth, methinks, there isneither Path norFruit forme.
What good shall Idobyliving intheforest ?Back totheMaster Iwillgo,and
livemy lifebeholding theglories oftheBuddha's presence andlistening tohis
sweet teachings." Andback again toJetavana hecame.
Now hisfriends andintimates said, "Sir, itwasyouwhoobtained from the
Master atheme formeditation anddeparted tolivethesolitary lifeofasage.
Yethereyouareback again, going about enjoying fellowship. Can itbethat
youhavewonthecrown oftheBrotlier's vocation andthatyouwillneverknow
re-birth'?" "Sirs, asIwon neither Path norFruit, Ifeltmyself doomed to
futility, andsogaveuppersevering andcame back." "You have done wrong.
Sir,inshewing afaint heartwhenyouhaddevoted yourself tothedoctrine ofthe
dauntless Master. [107] Come, letusbring youtotheBuddha's notice." And
theytookhimwiththem totheMaster.
^Theterms pabhajjd andupasampadd, which denote thetwostages ofinitiation

When theMaster became aware oftheir coming, hesaid, "Jirethren, you
bring withyouthisBrother against hiswill. AVhat hashedone?"
"Sir, after devoting himself tosoabsolutely trueadoctrine, thisBrother has
given \\\)persevering inthesolitary lifeofasage,and iscome back."
Then saidtheMaster tohim, "Is ittrue, asthey say,that you. Brother,
have given uppersevering?" "It istrue. Blessed One." "But howcomes it
that, after devoting yourself tosuch adoctrine, you,Brother, should betheoneto
show yourself notaman desiring little, contented, solitary, anddetermined, but
aman lacking perseverance'(Was itnotyouwhowere sostout-hearted in
bygone days (Was itnotbyyousingle-handed, thanks toyour perseverance,
tliat inasandy desert themenandtheoxen belonging toacaravan offive
hiuidred carts gotwater andwere cheered ?Andhow isitthat, now,youare
giving in?"These woi'ds sufficed togiveheart tothatBrother.
Hearing this talk, theBi-ethren asked theBlessed One, saying, "Sir, the
present faintheartedness ofthisBrother isclear tous ;buthidden from usisthe
knowledge ofhow,bytheperseverance ofthis single man, themenandoxen got
water inasandy desert andwere cheered. This isknown only toyouwhoare
omniscient;pray tellusabout it."
"Hearken, then, Bi'ethren," saidtheBlessed One; and,having excited their
attention, hemade clear thething that re-birth hadconcealed fromthem.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasking inBenares inKasi the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoatrader's family. When hewasgrown u}),he
used totravel about trading with500 carts. Ononeoccasion hecame
toasandy wilderness sixty leagues across, thesand ofwhich was sofine
that,when graspctl, itslipped through thefingers oftheclosed fist.Assoon
asthesungotup,itgrew ashotasabedofcharcoal-embers andnobody
could walkupon it.Accordingly, those traversing itused totake fire-
wood, water, oil,riceand soforth ontheir carts, andonly travelled by
night. Atdawn they used torange their carts inacircle toform a
laager, withanawning spread overhead, and after anearly meal used to
sitintheshade alltheday long. When thesunwent down, theyhad
their evening meal ;and, sosoon astheground became cool, theyused to
yoke their carts andmove forward. Travelling onthis desert was like
voyaging over thesea; a'desert-pilot,' ashewas called, had toconvoy
them overbyknowledge ofthestars [108]. And thiswastheway in
which ourmerchant wasnow travelling thatwilderness.
When hehadonlysome seven more miles before him, hethought to
himself, "To-night will seeusoutofthissandy wilderness." So,after
theyhadhadtheir supper, heordered thewood andwater tobethrown
away, andyoking hiscarts, setoutontheroad. Inthefront cartsatthe
pilotupon acouch looking uptothestars intheheavens and directing
thecourse thereby. Butsolonghadhebeen without sleep thathewas

oxen hadturned round andwere retracing their stejjs. Allnight the
oxenkeptontheir way,butatdawn thepilotwoke up,and,observing the
disposition ofthestars overhead, shouted out, "Turn thecarts round !

turu thecarts round !"And asthey turned thecarts round andwere
forming them into line, thedaybroke. "Why this iswhere wecamped
yesterday," cried thepeople ofthecaravan. "Allourwood andwater is
gone, andwearelost." Sosaying, theyunyoked their carts andmade a
laager andspread theawning overhead ;then eachman flung himself
down indespair beneath hisown cart. Thought theBodhisatta tohimself,
"IfIgive in,every single one will perish." Soheranged toand fro
while itwas stillearlyand cool, untilhecame onaclump ofkusa-grass.
"This grass," thought he,"can onlyhavegrown upherethanks tothe
2>resence ofwater underneath." Soheordered aspade tobebrought and
ahole tobedugatthat spot. Sixty cubits down they dug, tillatthat
depth thespade struck onarock, andeverybody lost heart. Butthe
Bodhisatta, feeling sure there must bewater under that rock, de-
scended intotheholeandtook hisstand upon therock. Stooping down, he
applied hiseartoit,and listened. Catching thesound ofwater flowing
beneath, hecame outand said toaserving-lad, "Myboy, ifyougive in,
weshall allperish. Sotake heart andcourage. Godown intothehole
with thisironsledge-hammer, andstrike therock."
Obedient tohismaster's bidding, [109] the lad, resolute where all
others had lost heart, wentdown andstruck therock. Therockwhich
haddammed thestream, split'asunder and fell in.Uprosethewater in
thehole till itwas ashigh asapalm-tree ;andeverybody drank and
bathed. Then they chopped uptheir spare axles andyokes andother
surplus gear, cooked their riceand ate it,andfedtheir oxen. And as
soon asthesun set,they hoisted aflagbytheside ofthewelland
travelled ontotheir destination. There they bartered away their goods
fortwice andfourtimes their value. With theproceeds theyreturned to
theirownhome, where they lived outtheir term oflifeandintheend
passed away tofarethereafter according totheir deserts. TheBodhisatta
tooafter alifespent incharity andother good works, passed away likewise
tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
When theSupreme Buddha haddelivered thisdiscourse, he,theAll-Knowing
Onehimself, uttered thisstanza:—
Untiring, deep theydugthatsandy ti-ack
Till, inthetrodden way, they water found.
Soletthesage, iuperseverance strong.
Flag notnor tire, until hisheart find Peace.
[110] This discourse ended, hepreached theFour Truths, atthe close
v-'hereof thefainthearted Brother wasestablished inthehighest Fruit ofall,
which isArahatship.
Having toldthese two stories, theMaster established theconnexion linking
them both together, and identified theBirth bysaying:—"This fainthearted
Brother ofto-day was inthose days theserving-lad who, persevering, broke the
rockandgave water toallthepeople ;theBuddha's followers were therestof
thepeople ofthecaravan; and Imyself wastheir leader."

SERIVANIJA- JATAK A.
"//"inthisfaith." This lesson toowastaught bytheBlessed One while
atSiivatthi, alsoabout aBrother whogaveuppersevering.
For,when themanwasbrought bytheBrethren exactly asintheforegoing
case, theMaster said, "You, Brother, who after devoting yourself tothisglorious
doctrine which bestows PathandFruit, [111] aregiving ujjpersevering, willsuffer
long, likethehawker ofSeriwho lostagolden bowlworth ahundred thousand
pieces."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this tothem. TheBlessed
Onemade clearathing concealed fromthem byre-birth.
Once onatime inthekingdom ofSeri, fiveaeons ago,theBodhisatta
dealt inpotsandpans, andwas called'theSerivan.' Inthecompany of
another dealer inthesame wares, agi-eedy fellow whowasalsoknown
as'theSerivan,' hecame across theriver Telavaha andentered thecity
ofAndhapura. Apportioning thestreets between thetwo ofthem, he
setabout hawking hiswares round thestreets ofhisdistrict, andthe
other did tliesame inhisdistrict.
Now inthat citythere was adecayed family. Once theyhadbeen
richmerchants, butbythetime ofourstory theyhad lost allthesonsand
brothers and alltheir wealth. The solesurvivors were agirlandher
grandmother, andthey gottheir living byworking forhire. Nevertheless,
theyhadgotintheir house thegolden bowl outofwhich intheolddays
thegreat merchant, thehead ofthefamily, used toeat ;but ithadbeen
thrown among thepotsandpans, andhaving been long outofuse,was
grimed overwith dirt, sothat thetwowomen didnotknow that itwas
gold. Tothedoor oftheir house came thegreedy hawker onhisround,
crying, "Waterpots tosell !Waterpots tosell !"And thedamsel, when
sheknew hewas there, said tohergrandmother, "Oh,dobuymea
ti'inket, grandmother."
"We're very poor, dear; what canweoffer inexchange forit?"
"Why here's this bow^lwhich isnogood tous.Letnschange that
forit."
Theoldwoman hadthehawker bi'ought inandseated, andgavehim
thebowl, saying, "Take this, sir,andbesogood astogiveyour sister
something orother inexchange."
Thehawker took thebowl inhishand, turned itovei', and,suspecting
itwasgold ,scratched alineontheback ofitwith aneedle, whereby he


No. 3. 13
knew forcertain that itwasreal gold. Then, thinking thathewould get
thepotwithout giving anything whatever for ittothewomen, hecried,
"What's thevalue ofthis,pray 1Why itisn'tworth halfafarthing!"[112]
And therewithal hethrew thebowlontheground, roseupfrom hisseat,
and leftthehouse. Now, asithadbeen agreed between thetwohawkers
thattheonemight ti-ythestreets which theother hadalready been into,
theBodhisatta came intothatsame street andappeared atthedoor ofthe
house, crying, "Waterpots tosell !"Once again thedamsel made thesame
request ofhergrandmother ;andtheoldwoman replied, "Mydear, the
firsthawker threw ourbowl ontheground andflung outofthehouse.
What havewegotlefttooffernow1"
"Oh,butthathawker wasaharsh-spoken man, grandmother dear;
whilst thisonelooks anicemanandspeaks kindly. Very likely hewould
take it." "Callhiminthen." Sohecame intothehouse, andtheygave
himaseatandputthebowl into hishands. Seeing that thebowlwas
gold, hesaid, "Mother, thisbowl isworth ahundred thousand pieces ;I
haven't itsvalue with me."
"Sir,the firsthawker whocame here saidthat itwasnotworth halfa
farthing;sohethrew ittotheground andwentaway. Itmust havebeen
theefficacy ofyourowngoodness which hasturned thebowl into gold.
Take it;giveussomething orother for it ;andgoyour way." Atthe
time theBodhisatta had500pieces ofmoney andastock worth asnnich
more. Thewhole ofthishegave tothem, saying, "Letmeretainmy
scales,mybag,andeight pieces ofmoney." And with their consent he
took these with him,anddeparted with allspeed totheriver-side where he
gave hiseight coins totheboatman andjumped into the boat. Sub-
sequently thatgreedy hawker hadcome back tothehouse, andhadasked
them tobring outtheir bow], saying hewould givethem something or
other for it.But theoldwoman flew out athimwith these words,
"You made outthatourgolden bowlwhich isworth ahundred thousand
pieces wasnotworth even ahalf-farthing. Butthere came anupright
hawker (your master, Itake it),whogave usathousand pieces for itand
took thebowlaway."
Hereupon heexclaimed, "Hehasrobbed meofagolden bowl worth
afullhundred thousand pieces; hehascaused meaterrible loss." And
intense soitow came upon him, sothathelostcommand overhimself and
became likeonedistraught. [113] Hismoney andgoods heflungaway at
thedoor ofthehouse;hethrew offhisupper andunder cloths ;and,
armed with thebeam ofhisscales asaclub, heti'acked theBodhisatta
down totheriver-side. Finding thelatter already crossing, heshouted to
theboatman toputback, buttheBodhisatta toldhimnottodoso.As
theother stood there gazing andgazing attheretreating Bodhisatta, intense
sorrow seized upon him. Hisheartgrew hot; blood gushed from hislips;


14 TheJataka. Book I.
andhisheart cracked likethemud atthebottom ofatank, which thesun
hasdried up.Through thehatred which liehadcontracted against the
Bodhisatta, lieperished theuandthere. (This wasthe firsttimeDevadatta
conceived agrudge against theBodhisatta.) TheBodhisatta, after alife
spent incharity andother good woi'ks, passed away tofare accoi'ding to
hisdeserts.
When theSuj^reme Buddha hadended thi.s lesson, he,theAll-Knowing One
himself, uttered thisstanza:—
Ifinthis faith youprove remiss, and fail
Towinthegoalwhereto itsteachings lead,—Then, likethehawker called 'the Serivan^,'
Full long you'll ruetheprize your folly lost.
After having thus delivered hisdiscourse insuch away astoleadupto
Arahatship, theMaster expounded theFour Truths, attheclose whereof the
fainthearted Brother was established inthat highest Fruit ofall,which is
Arahatship.
And, after telling thetwo stories, theMaster made theconnexion linking
them both together, and identified theBirth bysaying inconclusion, "Inthose
days Devadatta wasthefoolish hawker; and Imyself wasthewiseandgood
hawkei-."

[114] ''•With humblest start.'" This storywastoldbytheMaster about the
Elder named LittleWayman, while inJivaka's Mango-grove^ near Rajagaha.
And hereanaccount ofLittleWayman's birthmust begiven. Tradition tells
usthatthedaughter ofarichmerchant's family inRajagaha actually stooped to
intimacy with aslave. Becoming alarmed lesthermisconduct should getknown,
shesaidtotheslave, "Wecan't liveonhere ;forifmymother andfather come
toknow ofthis sinofours, they willtearuslimbfrom limb. Letusgoand live
afar oft"." Sowith their belongings intheirhands they stole together outbythe
hardly-o})ened door, and fledaway, they cared notwhither, tofindashelter
beyond thekenofherfamily. Then theywentand lived together inacertain
place, with theresult thatsheconceived. Andwhen her fulltimewasnearly
come, shetoldherhusband and said,"If Iamtaken inlabour away from kith
and kin,that willbeatrouble toboth ofus.Soletusgohome." First he

agreed tostart to-day, andthenheput itoff tillthemorrow ;andsoheletthe
days slipby, tillshethought toherself, "This fool issoconscious ofhisgreat
offence thathedares notgo.One's parents areone's best friends;sowhether
hegoes orstays, Imust go." So,when hewent out,sheput allherhousehold
matters inorder andsetoffhome, telling hernext-door neighbour where shewas
going. Returning home, andnotfinding hiswife, butdiscovering from the
neighbours thatshehadstarted offhome, hehurried after herandcameupwith
herontheroad ;andthenandthere shewastaken inlabour.
"What's this,mydearl" said he.
"Ihave given birth toason,myhusband," said she.
Accordingly, astheverything hadnowhappened which wastheonlyreason
forthejourney, they both agreed that itwasnogood going onnow,and so
turned back again. And astheir childhadbeen bornbytheway,they called
him'Wayman.'
[115] Notlong after, shebecame with child again, andeverything fellout
asbefore. And asthissecond child toowasbornbytheway,they called him
'Wayman' too,distinguishing theelder as'Great Wayman' andtheyounger as
'Little Wayman.' Then, withboth their children, theyagain wentback totheir
ownhome.
Now, astheywere living there, their way-child heard other boys talking of
their uncles andgrandfathers andgrandmothers ;soheasked hismother whether
hehadn't gotrelations liketheother boys. "Oh yes,mydear," said hismother;
"but they don't live here. Your grandfather isawealthy merchant inthecity
ofRajagaha, andyouhave plenty ofrelations there." "Why don'twegothere,
mother?" She told theboythereason whythey stayed away; but, asthe
children keptonspeaking about these relations, shesaid toherhusband, "The
children arealways plaguing me.Aremyparents going toeatusatsight?
Come, letusshew thechildren their grandfather's family." "Well, Idon'tmind
taking them there;but Ireally could notfaceyour parents." "All right;—so
long as,somewayorother, thechildren come toseetheir grandfather's family,"
said she.
Sothose twotook their children andcoming induecourse toRajagaha put
upinapublic rest-house bythecity gate. Then, taking withthem thetwo
children, thewoman caused their coming tobemadeknown toherparents.
The latter, onhearing themessage, returned thisanswer, "True, itisstrange to
bewithout children unless onehasrenounced theworld inquest ofArahatship.
Still, sogreat istheguilt ofthepairtowards usthattheymaynotstand inour
sight. Here isasum ofmoney forthem :letthem take thisand retire tolive
where they will. Butthechildren theymaysend here." Then themerchant's
daughter took themoney sosent her,anddespatched thechildren bythe
messengers. Sothechildren grew upintheir grandfather's house,—LittleWayman being oftender years, while GreatWayman used togowith hisgrand-
father tohear theBuddha preach theTruth. Andbyconstant hearing ofthe
Truth from theMaster's own lips,thelad's heart yearned torenounce theworld
forthe lifeofaBrother.
"With your permission," saidhetohisgrandfather, "Ishould liketojointhe
Brotherhood." "What doIhear?" cried theoldman. "Why, itwould giveme
greater joytoseeyoujointheOrder than toseethewhole world join. Become
aBrother, ifyou feelable." AndhetookhimtotheMaster.
"Well, merchant," saidtheMaster, "have youbrought yourboywithyou?"
"Yes, sir; this ismygrandson, whowishes tojoinyour Brotherhood." [116]
Then theMaster sent foraMendicant, andtoldhim toadmit theladtothe
Order; andtheMendicant repeated theFormida ofthePerishable Body ^and
1Buddhism teaches theimpermanence ofthings, andchief ofthetrains ofthought
forrealising thisdoctrine isthemeditation onthebodyand its32impurities (see
Sutta Nipata i.11,andthe12thJataka infra). Atthepresent dayevery novice in
Ceylon, when invested with theyellow robe oftheOrder, repeats theverses which
enumerate the32impurities.

admitted theladasanovice. When thelatter hadlearned byheartmany words
oftheBviddha, andwasoldenough, hewasadmitted afullBrother. Henow
gave himself uj)toearnest thought tillhewonArahatship ;andashepassed his
days intheenjoyment ofInsight andthePaths, hethought whether hecould
notimpart thelikehappiness toLittleWayman. Sohewent tohisgrandfather
themerchant, and said,"Great merchant, withyour consent, Iwilladmit Little
Wayman totheOrder." "Pray doso,reverend sir,"wasthereply.
Then theElder admitted theladLittleWayman andestablished him inthe
TenCommandments. ButLittleWayman proved adullard :with fourmonths'
study hefailed togetbyheart thissingle stanza:—
Lo !likeafragrant lotus atthedawn
Ofday, full-blown, with virgin wealth ofscent,
Behold theBuddha's glory shining forth,
Asinthevaulted heaven beams thesun !
For,wearetold, intheBuddhahood ofKassapa thisLittleWayman, having
himself attained toknowledge asaBrother, laughed toscorn adullBrother who
waslearning apassage byheart. Hisscorn soconfused hisbutt, thatthelatter
could notlearn orrecite thepassage. Andnow, inconsequence, onjoining the
Brotherhood hehimself proved adullard. Eachnew linehelearned drove the
lastoutofhismemory ;andfourmonths slipped away while hewasstruggling
with this single stanza. Said hiselder brother tohim,"Wayman, youarenot
equal toreceiving thisdoctrine. Lifourwhole months youhavebeenunable to
learn asingle stanza. How then canyouhope tocrown your vocation with
sui)reme success ?Leave themonastery." But,though thus expelled byhis
brother. LittleWayman wassoattached totheBuddha's creed thathedidnot
want tobecome alayman.
Now atthat time GreatWayman was acting assteward. And Jivaka
Komarabhacca, going tohismango-grove with alarge present ofperfumes and
flowers fortheMaster, hadpresented hisoftering andlistened toadiscourse;
then, rising from hisseatandbowing totheBuddha, hewent uptoGreat
Wayman andasked,"How many Brethren arethere, reverend sir,with the
Master?" "Just 500, sir." "Will youbring the500Brethren, with theBuddha
attheir head, totake their meal atmyhouse to-morrow?" "Lay-disciple, one
ofthemnamed LittleWayman isadullard andmakes noprogress intheFaith,"
saidtheElder ;"Iaccept theinvitation foreveryone buthim."
[117] Hearing this. LittleWayman thought tohimself, "Inaccepting the
invitation forallthese Brethren, theElder carefully accepts soastoexclude me.
Thisproves thatmybrother's affection formeisdead. What have Itodowith
thisFaith 'IIwillbecome alayman and liveintheexercise ofcharity andother
good works ofalaycharacter." And onthemorrow early hewent forth,
avowedly tobecome alayman again.
Now atthe firstbreak ofday, ashewassurveying theworld, theMaster
became aware ofthis; andgoing forth even earlier than Little Wayman, he
paced toandfrobytheporch onLittleWayman's road. Asthelatter came out
ofthehouse, heobserved theMaster, andwith asalutation wentuptohim.
"Whither away atthishour, LittleWayman ?"saidtheMaster.
"My brother hasexpelled mefrom theOrder, sir ;and Iamgoing towander
forth."
"Little Wayman, asitwasunder methatyoutook thevows,why didyou
not,when expelled byyour brother, come tome ?Come, what haveyoutodo
with alayman's life IYou shall stopwith me." Sosaying, hetook Little
Wayman andseated him atthedoor ofhisownperfumed chamber. Then
giving him aperfectly clean cloth which hehadsupernaturally created, the
Master said,"Face towards theEast, andasyouhandle this cloth, repeat these
words—'Removal ofImj^urity; Removal ofImpuritj'.'" Then atthetime
appointed theMaster, attended bytheBrotherhood, went toJivaka's house and
satdown ontheseat setforhim,


No. 4. 17
Now LittleWayman, with hisgaze fixed onthesun, sathandling thecloth
andrepeating thewords, "Removal ofImpurity; Removal ofImpurity." And
ashekepthandling thepiece ofcloth, itgrew soiled. Then hethought, "Just
now this piece ofcloth wasquite clean ;butmypersonality hasdestroyed its
original state andmade itdirty. Impermanent indeed are allcompounded
things!"And even asherealised Death andDecay, hewon theArahat's
Illumination. Knowing that LittleWayman's mind hadwonIllumination, the
Master sent forth anapparition andinthissemblance ofhimself appeared before
him, asifseated infront ofhimandsaying, "Heed itnot, LittleWayman, that
thismere piece ofcloth hasbecome dirty andstained with impurity ;within
thee aretheimpurities oflustandother evilthings. Remove them." Andthe
apparition uttered these stanzas:—
Impurity inLust consists, notdirt;
AndLustweterm therealImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
Helives thegospel ofthe Pui'ified.
[118] Impurity inWrath consists, notdirt;
AndWrath weterm therealImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
ITelives thegospel ofthePurified.
Delusion isImpurity, notdirt;
Weterm Delusion realImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
ffelives thegospel ofthePurified.
Attheclose ofthese stanzas LittleWayman attained toArahatship with the
fourbranches ofknowledgei,whereby hestraightway came tohaveknowledge of
allthesacred texts. Tradition has itthat, inages past,when hewasakingand
wasmaking asolemn procession round hiscity,hewiped thesweat from his
brow with aspotless cloth which hewaswearing; andthecloth was stained.
Thought he,"Itisthisbody ofminewhich hasdestroyed theoriginal i>urity and
whiteness ofthecloth, and dirtied it.Impermanent indeed are allcomposite
things." Thus hegrasped theideaofimpermanence ;andhence itcame topass
that itwastheremoval ofimpurity which worked hissalvation.
Meantime, Jivaka Komarabhacca ofi'ered theWater ofDonation'-; butthe
Master puthishand over thevessel, saying, "Are there noBrethren, Jivaka, in
themonastery?"
SaidGreatWayman, "There arenoBrethren there, reverend sir.""Oh yes,
there are,Jivaka," saidtheMaster. "Hi, there!"saidJivaka toaservant ;"just
yougoandseewhether ornotthere areanyBrethren inthemonastery."
Atthatmoment Little Wayman, conscious ashewasthat hisbrother was
declaring there werenoBrethren inthemonastery, determined toshewhim
there were, and sofilled thewhole mango-gi'ove with nothing butBrothers.
Some weremaking robes, others dyeing, whilst others again were repeating the
sacred texts:—each ofathousand Brethren hemade unlike alltheothers.
Finding thishost ofBrethren inthemonastery, theman returned and said
thatthewhole mango-grove was fullofBrethren.
Butasregards theElder upinthemonastery—
Wayman, athousand-fold self-multiplied.
Saton, tillbidden, inthat pleasant grove.
^These fourbranches were (i)understanding ofthesense ofthesacred books,
(ii)understanding oftheir ethical truth, (iii) ability tojustify aninterpretation
grammatically, logically, etc.,and (iv)thepower ofpublic exposition.

"Now goback," saidtheMaster totheman,"and say'TheMaster sends for
himwhose name isLittle Wayman.'"
Butwhen themanwent and delivered hismessage, athousand mouths
answered, "IamLittleWayman !1amLittleWayman!"
Backcame themanwith thereport, "They allsaythey are'Little Wayman,'
reverend sir."
"Well nowgoback," saidtheMaster, "and takebythehand the firstoneof
themwhosaysheisLittleWayman. [119]andtheothers will allvanish." The
man didashewasbidden, andstraightway thethousand Brethren vanished from
sight. TheElder came backwith theman.
When themealwas over, theMaster said, "Jivaka, take Little Wayman's
bowl ;hewillreturn thanks." Jivaka did so.Then likeayoung lionroaring
defiance, theElder ranged thewhole ofthesacred texts through inhisaddress
ofthanks. Lastly, theMaster rosefrom hisseatandattended bytheOrder
returned tothemonastery, and there, after theassignment oftasks bythe
Brotherhood, herosefrom hisseatand,standing inthedoorway ofhisperfumed
chamber, delivered aBuddha-discourse totheBrotherhood. Ending with a
theme which hegave outformeditation, anddismissing theBrotherhood, he
retired into hisperfumed chamber, andlaydown lion-like onhisright side to
rest.
Ateven, theorange-robed Brethren assembled together from allsides inthe
Hall ofTruth andsang theMaster's praises, even asthough theywerespreading
acurtain oforange clothround himasthey sat.
"Brethren," itwas said, "Great Wayman failed torecognise thebent of
LittleWayman, andexpelled himfrom themonastery asadullard whocould
noteven learn asingle stanza infourwhole months. ButtheAll-Knowing
Buddha byhissupremacy intheTruth bestowed onhimArahatship with allits
supernatural knowledge, even while asingle mealwas inprogress. Andbythat
knowledge hegrasped thewhole ofthesacred texts. Oh !howgreat isaBuddha's
power!"
Now theBlessed One,knowing fullwellthetalkthatwasgoing oninthe
Hall ofTruth, thought itmeet togothere. So,rising from hisBuddha-couch,
hedonned histwoorange under-cloths, girded himself aswith lightning, arrayed
himself inhisorange-coloured robe, theample robe ofaBuddha, andcame forth
totheHall ofTruth with theinfinite grace ofaBuddha, moving with theroyal
gait ofanelephant intheplenitude ofhisvigour. Ascending theglorious
Buddha- throne setinthemidst oftheresplendent hall,heseated himself upon
themiddle ofthethrone emitting those six-coloiired rayswhich mark aBuddha,—likethenewly-arisen sun,when from thepeaks oftheYugandhara Mountains
heillumines thedepths oftheocean. Immediately theAll-Knowing Onecame
intotheHall, theBrotherhood broke oflTtheir talkandwere silent. Gazing
round onthecompany with gentle loving-kindness, theMaster thought within
himself, "This company isperfect! Notaman isguilty ofmoving hand orfoot
improperly;notasound, notacough orsneeze istobeheard !Intheir
reverence andawe ofthemajesty andglory oftheBuddha, notamanwould
dare tospeak before Idid,even ifIsathere insilence allmy lifelong. But itis
raypart tobegin ;and Iwillopen theconversation." Then inhissweet divine
tones headdressed theBrethren and said, [120]"What, pray, isthetheme of
thisconclave? Andwhatwasthetalkwhich wasbroken off?"
"Sir," said they, "itwasnoprofitless theme, butyourown praises thatwe
were telling here inconclave."
Andwhen theyhadtoldhimword forwordwhat theyhadbeen saying, the
Master said, "Brethren, through meLittleWayman hasjustnow risen togi-eat
things intheFaith ;intimes past itwas togreat things inthewayofwealth
thatherose,—Viutequally through me."
TheBrethren asked theMaster toexplain this ;andtheBlessed Onemade
clear inthese words athing which succeeding existences hadhidden from
them:—

Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares inKasi,
theBodhisatta wasborn intotheTreasurer's family, andgrowing up,was
made Treasurer, being called Treasurer Little.Awiseandclever man
was he,with akeen eyeforsignsandomens. Onedayonhisway towait
upon theking, hecame onadeadmouse lying ontheroad;and,taking
note oftheposition ofthestars atthatmoment, hesaid,"Any decent
young fellow with hiswitsabout himhasonly topickthatmouse up,and

Hiswords were overheard byayoung man ofgood family butreduced
circumstances, who said tohimself, "That's amanwhohasalways gota

which hesold forafarthing atatavern fortheir cat.
With thefarthing hegotmolasses andtookdrinking water inawater-

hecame back again totheflower grounds provided withmore molasses
andapotofwater. Thatdaytheflower-gatherers, before they went, gave

Later, onerainy andwindy day, thewind blewdown aquantity of

Little returned toBenares.
Actuated byadesire toshew hisgratitude, hewent withonehundred
thousand pieces tocallonTreasurer Little. "How didyoucome byall
thiswealth?" asked the Treasui-er. "In four short months, simply by
following your advice," replied theyoungman;andhetoldhimthewhole
story, starting with thedead mouse. Thought LordHigh Treasurer Little,
onhearing allthis, "Imust seethatayoung fellow ofthese parts doesnot
fallintoanybody else's hands." Sohemarried himtohisowngrown-up
daughter and settled allthefamily estates ontheyoung man. And at
theTreasurer's death, hebecame Treasurer inthat city. And the
Bodhisatta passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
[123] Hislesson ended, theSupreme Buddha, theAll-Knowing Onehim-
self,repeated thisstanza :—
With humblest startand trifling capitalAshrewd andableman will risetowealth.
E'en ashisbreath cannurse atiny flame.
Also theBlessed One said, "It isthrough me.Brethren, that Little
Wayman hasjustnow risen togreat things intheFaith, asintimes past to
great things inthewayofwealth." Hislesson thus finished, theIMaster made
theconnexion between thetwo stories hehadtoldand identified theBirth in

"Dost askhowmuch apeck ofrice isxvorthV—ThiswastoldbytheMaster,
whilst atJetavana, about theElder Udayi, called theDullard.
Atthattime thereverend Dabba, theMallian, wasmanciple totheBrother-
hood ^When intheearly morning Dabba was allotting thechecks forrice,
sometimes itwaschoice riceandsometimes itwasaninferior qucxlity which fell
totheshare oftheElder Udayi. Ondayswhen hereceived theinferior quality,
heused tomake acommotion inthecheck-room, bydemanding, "IsDabba the
onlyonewhoknows how togiveoutchecks 1Don't weknow ?"Onedaywhen
hewasmaking acommotion, theyhanded himthecheck-basket, saying, "Here!
yougivethechecks outyourself to-day I"Thenceforth, itwasUdayi whogave
outthechecks totheBrotherhood. But, inhisdistribution, hecould nottellthe
bestfrom theinferior rice; nordidheknow what seniority^ wasentitled tothe
best riceandwhat totheinferior. Sotoo,when hewasmaking outtheroster,
hehadnotanidea oftheseniority oftheBrethren thereon. Consequently, when
theBrethi-en tookuptheir places, hemade amark ontheground oronthewall
toshew thatonedetachment stood here, andanother there. Next daythere
were fewer Brethren ofonegrade andmore ofanother inthecheck-room ;where
there were fewer, themarkwastoolowdown;where thenumber wasgreater, it
wastoohigh up.ButUdilyi, quite ignorant ofdetachments, gaveoutthechecks
simply according tohisoldmarks.
Hence, theBrethren said tohim,"Friend Udayi, themark istoohighup
ortoolowdown;thebest i-ice isforthose ofsuchandsuch seniority, andthe
inferior quality forsuchandsuch others." Butheputthem back with the
argument, "Ifthismark iswhere itis,what areyoustanding here for ?Whyam
Itotrustyou ?It'smymark Itrust."
Then, theboysandnovices [124] thrust himfrom thecheck-room, crying,
"Friend Udayi theDullard, when you give outthechecks, theBrethren are
docked ofwhat theyought toget;you're not fittogivethem out;getyougone
from here." Hereupon, agreat uproar arose inthecheck-room.
Hearing thenoise, theMaster asked theElder Ananda, saying, "Ananda,
there isagreat uproar inthecheck-room. What isthenoise about?"
TheElder explained italltotheBuddha. "Ananda," said he,"this isnot
theonlytimewhen Udilyi byhisstupidity hasrobbed others oftheir profit ;he
didjustthesame thing inbygone times too."
TheElder asked theBlessed One foranexplanation, andtheBlessed One
made clearwhathadbeen concealed byre-birth.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta was i*eigning inBenares inKasi. In
those days ourBodhisatta was hisvaluer. Heused tovahie horses,
elephants, andthelike ;andjewels, gold,andthelike\andheused to
payover totheowners ofthegoods theproper price, ashefixed it.

Butthekingwasgreedy andhisgreed suggested tohim thisthought:
"This vahier witli hisstyle ofvaluing willsoonexhaust alltheriches in
njyhouse; Imust getanother valuer." Opening hiswindow andlooking
outinto hiscourtyard, heespied walking across astupid, greedy hind in
whom hesawalikely candidate forthepost. Sotheking hadtheman
sent for,andasked himwhether hecould dothework. "Oh yes," said
theman ;and so,tosafeguard theroyal treasure, thisstupid fellow was
appointed valuer. After thisthefool, invaluing elephants andhorses and
thelike,used tofixaprice dictated byhisown fancy, neglecting their
trueworth ;but, ashewas valuer, theprice waswhat hesaidandno
other.
Atthattime tliere arrived from thenorth country^ ahorse-dealer with
500horses. Thekingsent forhisnewvaluer andbadehimvalue thehorses.
And theprice hesetonthewhole 500horses was justonemeasure of
rice,which heordered tobepaid over tothedealer, directing thehorses
tobeledofftothestable [125]. Away went thehorse-dealer totheold
valuer, towhom hetoldwhat hadhappened, andasked what was tobe
done. "Give himabribe," saidtheex-valuer, "and putthispoint tohim:
'Knowing aswedothatourhorses areworth just asingle measure of
rice,wearecurious tolearn fromyouwhat theprecise value ofameasure
ofrice is;could you state itsvalue intheking's presence VIfhesays
hecan,thentakehimbefore theking; and Itoowillbethere."
Readily following theBodhisatta's advice, thehorse-dealer bribed the
manandputthequestion tohim. The other, having expressed hisability
tovalue ameasure ofrice,waspromptly taken tothepalace, whither also
went theBodhisatta andmany other ministers. With dueobeisance the
horse-dealer said, "8ire, Idonotdispute itthattheprice of500horses is
asingle measure ofrice ;butIwould askyour majesty toquestion your
valuer astothevalue ofthatmeasure ofrice." Ignorant ofwhat had
passed, theking said tothefellow, "Valuer, what are500horses worth?"
"Ameasure ofrice, sire," wasthereply. "Very good,myfriend;if500
horses then areworth onemeasure ofrice,what isthatmeasure ofrice
worth?" "It isworth allBenares and itssuburbs," was the fool's
reply.
(Thus welearn that, having first valued thehorses atameasure of
hill-paddy toplease theking, hewasbribed bythehorse-dealer toestimate
thatmeasure ofI'iceattheworth ofallBenares and itssuburbs. And
thatthough thewalls ofBenares were twelve leagues round bythemselves,
while thecityandsuburbs together were three hundred leagues round !

andwhen theDakshinapatha wasfamiliar.

[126JHereupon theministers clapped theirhands andlaughed merrily.
"We used tothink," they said inscorn, "that theearth andtherealm
were beyond price ;butnowwelearn that thekingdom ofBenares
together with itsking isonlyworth asingle measure ofrice !What
talents thevaluer has !How hasheretained hispost solong? Buttruly

Then theBodhisatta repeated thisstanza':
Dost askhowmuch apeck ofrice isworth I—Why, allBenares, both within and out.
Yet, strange totell, fivehundred horses too
Areworth precisely thissame peck ofrice!
Thus puttoopen shame, theking sentthefoolpacking, andgave the
Bodhisatta the office again. Andwhen his life closed, theBodhisatta
passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended andthetwo stories told, theMaster made theconnexion
linking both together, andidentified theBirth bysaying inconclusion, —"Udayi

Onedaywhen hehadtaken outhiscloths andbedding andhadspread
them out todryinhischamber, anumber ofBrethren from thecomitry,
whowereonapilgrimage frommonastery tomonasteryi,came intheirjourneying
tohiscellandfound allthese belongings.
"Whose arethese?" they asked. "Mine, sirs," hereplied. "What, sir?"
they cried ;"thisupper-cloth and that aswell ;thisunder-cloth aswell as
that; andthat bedding too,—isitallyours?" "Yes, nobody's butmine."
"Sir," said they, "theBlessed Onehasonly sanctioned three cloths;and
yet,though theBuddha, towhose doctrine youhav^edevoted yourself, issosimple
inhiswants, youforsooth haveamassed allthisstock ofrequisites. Come !
wemust takeyou before theLord ofAVisdom." And, sosaying, theywent
offwithhim totheMaster.
Becoming aware oftheir presence, theMaster said, [127]"Wherefore isit,
Brethren, thatyouhave brought theBrother against hiswill?" "Sir, this
Brother iswell-oft' andhasquite astock ofrequisites." "Is ittrue, Brother, as
they say,thatyouaresowell-oft'?" "Yes, Blessed One." "But why, Brother,
haveyouamassed these belongings ?Donot 1extol thevirtues ofwanting
little, contentment, andsoforth, solitude, anddetermined resolve?"
Angered bytheMaster's words, hecried,—"Then I'llgoabout likethis!"
And, flinging off"hisouter clothing, hestood intheir midst clad only inhis
waist-cloth.
Then, asamoral support tohim, theMaster said, "Was itnotyou.Brother,
who inbygone dayswereaseeker after theshamefacedness that fears tosin,and
evenwhen youwere awater-demon lived fortwelve years seeking after that
shamefacedness ?How thencomes itthat, aftervowing tofollow theweighty
doctrine oftheBuddha, youhave flung oft"your outer robesandstand heredevoid
ofshame?"
Atthe]\Iaster's word, hissense ofshame wasrestored;hedonned hisrobes
again, and,saluting theMaster, seated himself attheside.
TheBrethren having asked theBlessed One toexplain tothem thematter he
hadmentioned, theBlessed Onemade clearwhathadbeen concealed fromthem
byre-birth.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta wasreigning inBenares inKasi. The
Bodhisatta, having come tobirth inthose days astheking's sonbythe
queen, wasdulynamed Prince Maliimsasa. Bythetime hecould run
about, asecond sonwasborn totheking, andthename theygave this
child was Prince Moon ;butbythetime hecould run about, the
Bodhisatta's mother died. Then thekingtookanother queen, whowashis
joyanddelight; and their lovewascrowned with thebirth ofyetanother
prince, whom theynamed Prince Sun. Inhisjoyatthebirth oftheboy,
theking promised togrant heranyboon shemight askonthechild's
behalf. Butthequeen treasured upthepromise tobefulfilled atherown
good time hei-eafter. Later, when hersonhadgrown up,shesaid tothe
king, "Sire, whenmyboywasborn,yougranted meaboon toaskfor
him. Lethimbekinar."
*Itake this tobethemeaning ofsendsana-cdrihu, incontradistinction tothe
ordinary cdrikd inwhich thedestination wasuncertain andinwhich almswere received
from thelaity.

"Nay," saidtheking; "two sonshave I,radiant asflaming fii'es ;I
cannot givethekingdom toyour son."' Butwhen hesaw that,undaunted
bythis refusal, thequeen kept plaguing liimtime after time, togrant her
request, [128] theking, fearing lestthewoman should plot evilagainst
hissons, sent forthemand said, "Mychildren, when Prince Sunwasborn,
Igranted aboon;andnow hismother wants thekingdom forhim. I
havenowi.sh togivehimthekingdom;butwomen arenaturally wicked, and
shewillbeplotting evilagainst you.Youhadbetter retire totheforest,
toreturn atmydeath torule inthecitywhich belongs byright toour
house." Sosaying, with tears andlamentations, theking kissed histwo
sonsontheheadandsentthem forth.
Asthe 2)riuces were leaving thepalace after their adieux totheir
father, whoshould seethem butPrince Sun himself, whowasplaying in
thecourtyard ?Andnosooner didhelearn whatwasthematter than he
made uphismind togowith hisbrothers. Sohetoowent offintheir
company.
The three came totheregion oftheHimalayas ;andhere the
Bodhisatta, whohadturned asidefrom theroadandwassitting atthefoot
ofatree, said toPrince Sun,"Run down tothepool yonder. Sundear;
diink andbathe there;andthen bring ustoosome water back inalotus-
leaf."
(Now that poolhadbeen delivered OA'er toacertain water-sprite by
Vessavana\ whosaid tohim,"With theexception ofsuch asknow what is
truly god-like, allthatgodown into thispool areyours todevour. Over
those thatdonotenter thewaters, youhavenopower granted toyou."
And thenceforth thewater-sprite used toask ailwhowentdown intothe
poolwhatwastruly godlike, devouring everyone whodidnotknow.)
Now itwas into this pool that Prince Sunwent down, quite un-
suspiciously, with theresult thathewas seized bythewater-sprite, who
said tohim,"Doyouknow what istruly godlikel" "Oyes," saidhe;
"thesunandmoon." "You dont know," saidthemonster, andhauling
theprince down intothedepths ofthewater, imprisoned himthere inhis
ownabode. Finding that hisbrother wasalongtime gone, theBodhisatta
sent Prince Moon. Hetoowas seized bythe water-s2)rite andasked
whether heknew what wastruly godlike. "Oh yes, Iknow," saidhe;
"the four quarters ofheaven are." "Vou don't know," said thewater-
sprite ashehauled thissecond victim offtothesame prison-house.
Finding that thissecond brother tootarried long, theBodhisatta felt
sure thatsomething hadhappened tothem. Soaway hewent afterthem
andtracked their footsteps down intothewater. [129] Realising atonce

thatthepoolmust bethedomain ofawater-sprite, hegirded onhissword,
andtook hisbow inhishand, andwaited. Nowwhen thedemon found
that theBodhisatta hadnointention ofentering thewater, heassumed the
shape ofaforester, andinthisguise addressed theBodhisatta thus :"You're
tired withyour journey, mate ;why don't yougoinandhave abathe and
adrink, anddeck yourself with lotuses 1Youwould travel oncomfortably
afterwards." Recognising him atonce forademon, theBodhisatta said,
"It isyouwhohave seizedmybrothers." "Yes, itwas," wasthereply.
"Why?""Because allwhogodown into thispoolbelong tome.""What,
all?" "Not thosewhoknow what istruly godlike;allsave these are
mine." "And doyouwant toknow thegodlike?" "Ido." "Ifthisbe
so,Iwill tellyouwhat istruly godlike." "Doso,andIwill listen."
"Ishould liketobegin," saidtheBodhisatta, "butIamtravel -stained
withmyjourney." Then thewater-sprite bathed theBodhisatta, and
gave him food toeatandwater todrink, decked himwith flowers,
sprinkled himwith scents, and laidoutacouch forhiminthemidst ofa
gorgeous pavilion. Seating himself onthiscouch, andmaking thewater-
sprite sitathisfeet,theBodhisatta said, "Listen thenandyoushallhear
what thetruly godlike is."Andherepeated thisstanza:—
Those only 'godlike' callwhoshrink from sin.
Thewhite-souled tranquil votaries ofGood.
[132]Andwhen thedemon heard this,hewaspleased, andsaidtothe
Bodhisatta, "Man ofwisdom, Iampleased with you,andgiveyouupone
ofyour brothers. Which shall Ibring?" "The youngest." "Man of
wisdom, though youknow sowellwhat thetruly godlike is,youdon't act
onyour knowledge." "How so?""Why, youtake theyounger in
preference totheelder, without regard tohisseniority." "Demon, Inot
onlyknow butpractise thegodlike. Itwasonthis boy's account thatwe
sought refuge intheforest ;itwas forhim that hismother asked the
kingdom from our father, andour father, refusing tofulfil herdemand,
consented toourflight totherefuge oftheforest. With uscame thisboy,

were togiveoutthathehadbeendevoured byademon intheforest ;and

"Excellent! excellent! Oman ofwisdom," cried thedemon inapproval;
"you notonlyknow butpractise thegodlike." [133]And intoken ofhis
pleasure andapproval hebrought forth the tivobrothers andgavethem
both totheBodhisatta.
Then saidthelatter tothewater-sprite, "Friend, itisinconsequence
ofyourown evildeeds intimes past thatyouhavenowbeen born a
demon subsisting onthefleshandblood ofother living creatures ;andin
thispresent birth tooyouarecontinuing todoevil. This evilconduct

will forever baryoufrom escaping re-birth inhelland theother
evil states. Wherefore, from thistime forth renounce eviland live
virtuously."
Having worked thedemon's conversion, theBodhisatta continued to
dwell atthatspotunder hisprotection, until onedayheread inthe star.i
that hisfather was dead. Then taking thewater-sprite with him, he
returned toBenares andtook possession ofthekingdom, making Prince
Moon hisviceroy andPrince Sun hisgeneralissimo. Forthewater-sprite
hemade ahome inapleasant spotandtookmeasures toensure hisbeing
provided with thechoicest garlands, flowers, and food. Hehimself ruled

"Vou7' sonam /."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about thestory ofVasabha-Khattiya, which will befound intheTwelfth
Book intheBhaddasala-jataka^. Tradition tellsusthatshewasthedaughter of
Mahanama Sakka byaslave-girl named Nagamunda, andthat sheafterwards
became theconsort oftheking ofKosala. Sheconceived asonbytheking;
buttheking,coming toknow ofherservile origin, degraded herfrom herrank,
and alsodegraded hersonVidudabha. Mother andsonnever came outside
thepalace.
Hearing ofthis, theMaster atearlydawn came tothepalace attended
bylivehundred Brethren [134], and, sitting down ontheseatprepared for
him, said, "Sire, where isVasabha-Khattiya?"
Then theking toldhimwhathadhappened.
"Sire, whose daughter isVasabha-Khattiya?" "Mahanama's daughter, sir."
"When shecame away, towhom didshecome aswifeT' "Tome, sir." "Sire,

sou. Wherefore isthat souuotinauthority over therealm which owns his
father's sway ?Inbygone days, amonarch whohadasonbyacasual'faggot-
gatherer gave thatsouhissovereignty."
Theking asked theBlessed One toexplain this. TheBlessed Onemade
clearwhathadbeen concealed fromhimbyre-birth.
Onceonatime inBenares Brahmadatta theking,having gone ingreat
state tohisjdeasaunce, wasroaming about looking forfruits andflowers
when hecame onawoman whowasmerrily singing away asshepicked
upsticks inthegrove. Falling inlove atfirst sight, thekingbecame
intimate with her,andtheBodhisatta wasconceived then and there.
Feeling asheavy within asthough weighed down with thebolt ofIndra,
thewoman knew that shewould become amothei", and toldtheking so.
Hegave herthesignet-ring from hisfinger anddismissed herwith
these words:—"If itbeagirl,spend thisringonhernurture;but ifit
beaboy,bring ringandchild tome."
When thewoman's timewascome, shebore theBodhisatta. And
when hecould runabout andwas playing intheplayground, acry
would arise, "No-father hashitme!" Hearing tliis, theBodhisatta ran
away tohismother andaskedwho hisfather was.
"You arethesonoftheKing ofBenares, myboy." "What proof
ofthis isthere, mother?" "My son, theking onleaving megaveme
this signet-ring and said,'Ifitbeagirl,spend thisringonhernurture;
but ifitbeaboy, bring ringand child tome.'""Why then don't
youtakemetomyfather, mother?"
[135] Seeing that theboy'smind wasmade up,shetookhim tothe
gate ofthepalace, andbade their coming beannounced totheking.
Being summoned in,sheentered andbowing before hismajesty said,
"This isyour son, sire."
Thekingknew wellenough that thiswasthetruth, butshame before
allhiscourtmadehim reply, "He isnosonofmine." "Buthere isyour
signet-ring, sire;you willrecognise that." "Nor isthismysignet-ring."
Then said thewoman, "Sire, Ihavenownowitness toprovemywords,
except toappeal totruth. Wherefore, ifyoubethefather ofmychild,
Ipray that hemay stay inmid-air ;but ifnot,mayhefalltoearth
andbekilled." Sosaying, sheseized theBodhisatta bythefootand
threw himupintothe air.
^Theword muhuttikdya means, Hterally, "momentary," orperhaps maybetrans-
lated"withwhom heconsorted butalittle while." Professor Kiinte (Ceylon R.A.S.
Journal, 1884, p.128) seesintheword areference totheMuhurta (mobotura) form of
marriage, which "obtains amoni^ theMahratbas other than theBrabmanas," and
which hecompares with thefamiliar Gandharva form, i.e. (legal) union bymutual
consent, onthespur ofthemoment, without anypreliminary formalities.

Seated cross-legged inmid-air, theBodhisatta insweet tones repeated
thisstanza tohisfathex", declaring thetruth:—
Your sonam I,great monarch ;rearme,Sire!
Theking rears others, butmuch more hischild.
Hearing theBodhisatta thus teach thetruth tohimfrom mid-air, tlie
king stretched outhishands and cried, "Come tome,myboy !None,
none butmeshall rearandnurture you!"Athousand hands were
stretched outtoreceive theBodhisatta
;[136] but itwasintothearms of

Atthedeath oftheking hisfather, hecame tothethrone bythe title
ofKing Katthavahana —thefaggot-bearer —,and after ruling hisrealm
righteously, passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Hislesson totheking ofKosala ended, and histwo stories told, theMaster

''•Lo!these grey hairsP—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana about theGreat Renunciation, which hasalready been related in
theNidana-Katha^.
Onthisoccasion theBrethren satpraising theRenunciation oftheLord
ofWisdom. Entering theHall ofTruth andseating himself ontheBuddha-
seat, theMaster thusaddressed theBrethren:—"What isyourtheme. Brethren,
asyou sithere inconclave?"
"It isnaught else, sir,than thepraise ofyourownRenunciation." "Brethren,"
rejoined theMaster, "not only inthese latter days hastheTathagata^ made a
Renunciation;inbygone days toohesimilarly renounced theworld."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One foranexplanation ofthis. TheBlessed
Onemade clearwhathadbeen concealed fromthembyre-birth.

Once onatime inMithila intherealm ofVidelia there was a
kingnamed Makhadeva, whowasrighteous andruled righteously. For
successive periods ofeighty-four thousand yeai's hehad respectively
amused himself asprince, ruled asviceroy, audreigned asking. All
these long years hadhelived, when onedayhesaid tohisbarber,—
"Tell me, friend barber, when you seeanygrey hairs inmyhead."
Sooneday,years andyears after, [138] thebarber did findamong the
raven locks oftheking asingle grey hair, andhetold theking so.
"Pull itout,myfriend," saidtheking; "and lay itinmypalm." The
barber accordingly plucked thehairoutwith hisgolden tongs, andlaid it
intheking's hand. Thekinghadatthattime stilleighty-four thousand
years more tolive;butnevertheless atthesight ofthatonegrey hair
hewas filled with deep emotion. Heseemed toseetheKing ofDeath
standing overhim, ortobecooped within ablazing hutofleaves. "Foolish
Makhadeva!"hecried;"grey hairs have come upon you before you
have been able toridyourself ofdepravities." And ashethought
andthought about theappearance ofhisgrey hair, hegrew aflame within;
thesweat rolled down from hisbody ;whilst hisraiment oppressed him
andseemed intolei-able. "This very day," thought he,"will Irenounce
theworld fortheBrother's life."
Tohisbarber hegave thegrant ofavillage, which yielded ahundred
thousand jneces ofmoney. Hesent forhiseldest sonandsaid tohim,
"My son,grey hairs arecome upon me,and Iambecome old. Ihave
hadmy fillofhuman joys, and fainwould taste thejoys divine;the
time formyrenunciation hascome. Take thesovereignty upon yourself
;
asforme,Iwilltake u]imyabode inthepleasaunce called Makhadeva's
Mango-grove, andthere tread theascetic's path."
Ashewasthusbentonleading theBrother's life,hisministers drew
nearand said, "What isthereason, sire,whyyouadopt theBrother's
life]"
Taking thegrey hair inhishand, theking repeated thisstanza tohis
ministers:—
Lo,these grey hairs thatonmyhead appear
AreDeath's ownmessengers thatcome torob
My life. 'Tistime Tturned from worldly things.
And inthehermit's path sought saving peace.
[139jAnd after these words, herenounced hissovereignty that self-.same
dayandbecame arecluse. Dwelling inthat very Mango-grove of
Makhadeva, hethere during eighty-four thousand years fostered the
Four Perfect States within himself, and, dying with insight fulland
unbroken, wasreborn intheRealm ofBrahma. Passing thence, he
became aking again inMithila, under thename ofNimi, and after
uniting hisscattered family, oncemore became ahermit inthatsame

Mango-grove, winniug theFour Perfect States andpassing thence once
more totheRealm ofBrahma.
After repeating hisstatement thathehad similarly renounced theworld
inbygone days, theMaster attheendofhislesson preached theFour Truths.
Some entered theFirst Path,some theSecond, andsome theThird. Having
told thetwo stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion between them and
identified the Birth, bysaying:—"In those daysAnanda was thebarber,
Eahula theson,and Imyself King Makhadeva."

[140]"Theman whogvwds not."—This story was toldbytheMaster
while intheAnupiya Mango-grove near thetown ofAnupiya, about theElder
Bhaddiya (theHappy), who joined theBrothei-hood inthecompany ofthe
sixyoung nobles withwhom was Upali^. Ofthese theElders Bhaddiya, Kimbila,
Bhagu, andUpali attained toArahatship;theElderAnanda entered theFirst
Path;theElder Anuruddha gained all-seeing vision;andDevadatta obtained
thepower ofecstatic self-abstraction. Thestory ofthesixyoung nobles, upto
theevents atAnupiya, willberelated intheKhandahala-jataka^.
The venerable Bhaddiya, whoused inthedays ofhisroyalty toguard
himself asthough hewere appointed hisown tutelary deity, bethought him
ofthestate offear inwhich hethen livedwhen hewasbeing guarded by
ninnerous guards andwhen heused totossabout even onhisroyal couch
inhisprivate apartments highupinthepalace;andwith thishecompared
theabsence offear inwhich, nowthatheM'asanArahat, heroamed hither
and thither inforests anddesert places. And atthethought heburst into
thisheartfelt utterance —"Oh,happiness !Oh,happiness!"

This theBrethren reported totheBlessed One, saying, "The venerable
Bhaddiya isdeclaring theblisshehaswon."
"Brethren," saidtheBlessed One, "this isnotthe firsttime thatBhaddiya's
lifehasbeenhappy ;his lifewasnolesshappy inbygone days."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this. The Blessed One
made clearwhathadbeen concealed fromthem byre-birth.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn awealthy northern brahmin. Realising theevilof
lusts andtheblessings that flowfrom renouncing theworld, heabjured
lusts, and retiring totheHimalayas there became ahermit andwon
theeight Endowments. Hisfollowing waxed great, amounting tofive
hundred ascetics. Oncewhen therains setin,hequitted theHimalayas
and travelling along onanalms-pilgrimage with hisattendant ascetics
through village andtown came atlast toBenares, where hetookup
hisabode intheroyal pleasaunce asthepensioner oftheking's bounty.
After dwelling here forthefour rainy months, hecame totheking
totake hisleave. Buttheking said tohim,"You areold,reverend sir.
Wherefore should yougoback tot]ieHimalayas 1Sendyour pupils back
thither [141] andstophere yourself."
The Bodhisatta entrusted his fivehundred ascetics tothecare of
hisoldest disciple, saying, "Goyouwith these totheHimalayas ;I
willstoponhere."
Now that oldest disciple hadonce been aking, buthadgiven up
amighty kingdom tobecome aBrother; bythedueperformance ofthe
rites appertaining toconcentrated thought hehadmastered theeight
Endowments. Ashedwelt with theascetics intheHimalayas, onedaya
longing came upon him toseethemaster, andhesaid tohisfellows,
"Live oncontentedly here ;Iwillcome back assoon asIhave paid
myrespects tothemaster." Soaway hewent tothemaster, paid his
respects tohim,andgreeted himlovingly. Then helaydown bytheside
ofhismaster onamatwhich hespread there.
Atthispoint appeared theking,whohadcome tothepleasaunce
toseetheascetic ;andwith asalutation hetook hisseatonone side.
Butthough hewasaware oftheking's presence, that oldest disciple
forbore torise,but still laythere, crying with passionate earnestness,
"Oh,happiness !Oh,happiness!"
Displeased that theascetic, though hehadseen him,hadnot risen,
theking said totheBodhisatta, "Reverend sir,thisascetic musthavehad
his filltoeat,seeing thathecontinues toliethere sohappily, exclaiming
with such earnestness."
"Sire," said theBodhisatta, "ofoldthis ascetic wasaking asyou
are.He isthinking how intheolddayswhen hewasalayman and

lived inregalpomp withmany aman-at-arms toguard him, henever
knew such happiness asnow ishis. Itisthehappiness oftheBrother's
life,and thehappiness that Insight brings, which move him tothis
heartfelt utterance." And theBodhisatta further repeated thisstanza
toteach theking theTruth :—
Themanwhoguards not,nor isguarded, sire,
Lives happy, freed from slavery tolusts.
[142] Appeased bythelesson thus taught him, thekingmade hissalu-
tation andreturned tohispalace. The disci])le alsotook hisleave ofhis
master andreturned totheHimalayas. ButtheBodhisatta continued to
dwell onthere, and,dying with Insight fullandunbroken, wasre-born in
theRealm ofBrahma.
Hislesson ended, andthetwostories told, theMaster shewed theconnexion
linking them both together, and identified theBirth bysaying, —"The Elder
Bhaddiya wasthedisciple ofthose days,and Imyself themaster ofthecompany
ofascetics."

"77ie upright many—This story was toldbytheMaster intheBamboo-

For,ontheoccasion now inquestion, Devadatta, through failing tocarry the
Five Points which hehadpressed for,hadmade aschism intheBrotherhood
andhadgone offwith fivehundred Brethren todwell atGaya-sisa. Now, these
Brethren came toariper knowledge;andtheMaster, knowing this, called the

subsist solely ondoles collected outofdoors, dress solely inragspicked outofdust-
heaps, dwell under treesandnever under aroof, never eatfishorflesh." These five
points were allmore rigid intheir asceticism than theBuddha's rule, andwere
formulated byDevadatta inorder tooutbid hiscousin andmaster.

perverted byDevadatta's teaching andwent offwith him,havenowcome toa
riper knowledge. Gothither with anumber ofBrethren, preach theTruth to
them, enligliten these wanderers resiiectiug thePaths andtheFruits, andbring
them backwith you."
They went thither, preached theTruth, enlightened them respecting the
Paths andtheFruits, andnextday[143] atdawn came back again with those
Brethren totheBamboo-grove. And whilst Sariputta wasstanding there after
saluting theBlessed Oneonhisreturn, theBrethren spoke thus tohim inpraise
oftheElder Sariputta, "Sir, verybright wastheglory ofourelder brother, the
Captain oftheTruth, ashereturned with afollowing offi\'ehundred Brethren;
whereas Devadatta haslost allhisfollowing."
"This isnottheonly time. Brethren, when glory hasbeen Sariputta's onhis
return with afollowing ofhiskinsfolk;likeglorywas histooinbygone days.
Sotoothis isnottheonlytimewhen Devadatta haslosthisfollowing;helost
italsoinbygone days."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain thistothem. TheBlessed
Onemade clearwhathadbeen concealed byre-birth.
Once onatime inthecity ofRajagaha inthekingdom ofMagadlia
there ruled acertain king ofMagadha, inwhose days theBodhisatta came
tolifeasastag. Growing up,hedwelt intheforest astheleader ofa
herd ofathousand deer.Hehadtwoyoung onesnamed Luckie and
Blackie. When hegrew old,hehanded hischarge over tohistwo sons,
placing fivehundred deerunder thecare ofeach ofthem. And sonow
thesetwoyoung stagswere incharge oftheherd.
Towards harvest-time inMagadha, when thecrops stand thick inthe
fields, itisdangerous forthedeer intheforests round. Anxious tokillthe
creatures thatdevour their crops, thepeasants digpitfalls, fixstakes, set
stone- traps, andplant snares andother gins ;sothatmany deer areslain.
Accordingly, when theBodhisatta marked that itwas crop-time, he
sent forhistwosonsandsaid tothem, "Mychildren, itisnowthetime
when crops stand thick inthe fields, andmany deermeet their death at
this season. Wewhoareoldwillmake shift tostay inonespot ;butyou
will retire eachwithyourherd tothemountainous tracts intheforest and
come backwhen thecrops have been carried." "Very good," said his
twosons,anddeparted with their herds, astheir father bade.

Attheclose ofhislesson, when theMaster hadrepeated that Sariputta's
gloryandDevadatta's losshadbothhadaparallel inbygone days, heshewed
theconnexion linking thetwo stories together and identified theBirth, by
saying, "Devadatta wastheBlackie ofthose days;hisfollowers were Blackie's

There wasafestival proclaimed inthat city, [146] andeverybody kept

reported totheElder, who proclaimed the Sister innocent before allthe
assembly. And she,nowthat herinnocence wasestablished, reverently saluted
theOrder andtheMaster, andwith theSisters returned toherownnunnery.
When hertimewascome, shebore thesonstrong inspirit, forwhom she

proved thesalvation andrefuge ofthese two :hewasthesame tothem inthe
past also."
Then, ontheBrethren asking him toexplain this tothem, herevealed what
re-birth hadhidden fromthem.
Onceonatime,when Brahmadatta wasreigning iuBenares, theBodhi-
sattawasborn adeer. Athisbirth hewasgolden ofhue ;hiseyeswere
likeround jewels;thesheen ofhisliorns wasasofsilver ;hismouth was
redasabunch ofscarlet cloth;hisfourhoofs were asthough lacquered;
histailwas liketheyak's ;andhewasasbigasayoung foal. Attended

Deer.Andhardbyhimdwelt another deer alsowdthanattendant herd of
livehundred deei*,whowasnamed Branch Deer, andwasasgolden ofhue
astheBodhisatta.
Inthose days theking ofBenares waspassionately fond ofhunting
andalways hadmeat atevery meal. Every dayhemustered thewhole of
hissubjects, townsfolk andcountryfolk alike, tothedetriment oftheir
business, andwent hunting. Thought hispeople, "Thisking ofours stops
allourwork. Suppose wewere [150] tosowfoodandsupply water for
thedeer inhisownpleasaunce, and,having driven inanumber ofdeer, to
barthem inanddeliver them over totheking!"Sotheysowed inthe
pleasaunce grass forthedeer toeatandsupplied water forthem to
drink, andopened thegate wide. Then they called outthetownsfolk and
setoutintotheforest armed with sticks and allmanner ofweapons tofind
thedeer. They surrounded about aleague offorest inorder tocatch
thedeer within their circle, andinsodoing sun-ounded thehaunt ofthe
Banyan andBranch deer. Assoon asthey perceived thedeer, they pro-
ceeded tobeat the trees, bushes andground with their sticks tillthey
drove theherds outoftheir lairs; thenthey rattled their swords andspears
andbows with sogreat adinthat they drove allthedeer into the
pleasaunce, andshut thegate. Then theywent tothekingand said,
"Sire,youputastop toourwork byalways going a-hunting ;sowehave
driven deerenough from theforest tofillyour pleasaunce. Henceforth
feedontJiem."
Hereupon theking betook himself tothepleasaunce, and inlooking
over theherd sawamong them twogolden deer, towhom hegranted
immunity. Sometimes hewould goofhisownaccord andshoot adeer to
bringhome ;sometimes hiscookwould goandshoot one.At first sight
ofthebow, thedeerwould dash offtrembling fortheir lives, butafter
receiving twoorthreewounds theygrew weary and faint andwere slain.
Theherd ofdeer told thistotheBodhisatta, whosent forBranch and said,
"Friend, thedeer arebeing destroyed ingreatnumbers;and,though they

Great Being arose, established theking intheFiveCommandments,
saying, "Walk inrighteousness, great king. Walk inrighteousness
andjustice towards parents, children, townsmen, andcountryfolk, sothat
when thisearthly body isdissolved, youmay enter the bliss ofheaven."
Thus, with thegrace andcharm thatmarks aBuddha, didheteach the
Truth totheking.Afewdayshetarried inthepleasaunce fortheking's
instruction, andthen with hisattendant herd hepassed into the forest
again.
And that doebrought forth afawn fair astheopening bud ofthe

mother saidtohim,"My child, don't goabout with him, onlygoabout
with theherd oftheBanyan deer." And byway ofexhortation, she
repeated thisstanza:—
Keep only with theBanyan deer, andshun
TheBranch deer's herd; more welcome far
Isdeath,mychild, inBanyan's company.
Than e'entheamplest term oflifewith Branch.
Thenceforth, thedeer,now intheenjoyment ofimmunity, used toeat
men's crops, andthemen, remembering theimmunity granted tothem,
didnotdare tohitthedeer ordrive them away. Sotheyassembled in
theking's courtyard and laidthematter before theking. Said he,"When
theBanyan deerwonmyfavoui-, [153] Ipromised himaboon. Iwill
forego mykingdom rather thanmypromise. Begone 1Notaman inmy
kingdom mayharm thedeer."
Butwhen thiscame tothe eai's oftheBanyan deer, hecalled hisherd
together and said, "Henceforth you shall noteatthecrops ofothers."
Andhaving thus forbidden them, hesentamessage tothemen, saying,
"From thisdayforward, letnohusbandman fence his field, butmerely
indicate itwith leaves tiedupround it."And so,wehear, began a])lan
oftying upleaves toindicate thefields; andnever wasadeerknown to

Bodhisatta.

^''Cursed hethedart oflove."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana about thetemptation caused toBrethren bythewives oftheirmundane
life. This willberelated intheIndriya-jatakai intheEighth Book. Said the
Blessed OnetotheBrother, "Brother, itwasbecause ofthisverywoman that in
bygone daysyoumetyour death andwere roasted overglowing embers." The
Brethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this. TheBlessed Onemade clear
whathadbeen concealed fromthembyre-birth.

VVlieu theyknew that itwasthetime forthedeer tocomedown from
the hills, theMagadha folkposted themselves inambush bytheroad ;and
ahunter waslying inwait justbytheroad along which thepairwere
travelling. Scenting aman, theyoung doesuspected thatahunter wasin
ambush, and letthestaggoonfirst, following herself atsome distance.
With asingle arrow thehunter laidthestag low,andthedoeseeing him
struck was offlikethewind. Then thathunter came forth from his
hiding-place andskinned thestagand lighting afirecooked thesweet
flesh over theembers. Having eaten anddrunk, hetook offhome the
remainder ofthebleeding carcass onhiscarry ing-i)ole toregale hischildren.
Now inthose days theBodhisatta wasafaiiy dwelling inthatvery
grove oftrees, andhemarked what hadcome topass. "'Twas notfather
ormother, butpassion alone that destroyed this foolish deer [1.55]. The
dawn ofjtassion isbliss, but itsend issorrow andsuffering,—thepainful
loss ofhands, andthemisery ofthefiveforms ofbonds andblows. To
cause another's death isaccounted infamy inthisworld ;infamous too is
thelandwhich owns awoman's swayandrule ;andinfamous arethemen
who yield themselves towomen's dominion." And therewithal, while the
other fairies ofthewood applauded andoffered perfumes andfiowers and
thelikeinhomage, theBodhisatta wove thethree infamies intoasingle
stanza, andmade thewood re-echo with hissweet tones ashetaught the
truth inthese lines:—
Cursed bethedart oflovethatworks men pain I
Cursed bethelandwhere women rulesupreme!
And cursed thefoolthatbows towoman's sway!
Thus inasingle stanza were thethree infamies comprised bythe
Bodhisatta, andthewoods re-echoed ashetaught theTruth with allthe
mastery andgrace ofaBuddha [156].
Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theFour Truths, attheclosewhereof
thelove-sick Brother wasestablished intheFruit oftheFirst Path. Having
toldthetwo stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion linking thetwotogether,
andidentified theBirth.

"There! snothing xcorse." This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about theElder Tissa, called Direct-alms theLess. Tradition says that, while the
Master wasdwelling attheBamboo-grove nearRajagaha, thescion ofawealthy
house, Prince Tissa byname, coming oneday totheBamboo-grove andthere
hearing adiscourse from theMaster, wished tojointheBrotherhood, but,being
refused because hisparents would notgive their consent, obtained their consent
byfollowing Eattha-pjila's ^example andrefusing food forseven days,and finally
took thevows with theMaster.
About afortnight afteradmitting thisyoung man, theMaster repaired from
theBamboo-grove toJetavana, where theyoung nobleman undertook theThirteen
Obligations^andpassed histime ingoing hisround foralms from house to
house, omitting none. Under thename oftheElder Tissa Direct-alms the
Less, hebecame asbright andshining alight inBuddhism asthemoon in
thevault ofheaven.
Afestival having been proclaimed atthistime atRajagaha, theElder's
mother andfather laid inasilver casket thetrinkets heused towear asa
layman, andtook ittoheart, bewailing thus,—"Atother festivals oursonused
towear this orthatbravery ashekept thefestival ;and he,ouronly son,
hasbeen taken away bythesageGotama tothetown ofSavatthi. Where
isoursonsitting noworstanding?" Now aslave-girl whocame tothehouse,
noticed thelady ofthehouse weeping, andasked herwhyshewasweeping ;and
thelady toldher all.
"What, madam, wasyour sonfond of?""Ofsuch andsuch athing,"
replied thelady. "Well, ifyou willgivemeauthority inthishouse, I'llfetch
your sonback." "Very good," said thelady inassent, andgave the girlher
expenses anddespatched herwith alarge following, saying, "Go,andmanage to
fetchmysonback."
Soaway the girlrode inapalanquin toSavatthi, where shetookupher
residence inthe street which theElder used tofrequent foralms. [157]
Surrounding herself with servants ofherown,andnever allowing theElder
toseehisfather's people about, shewatched themoment when theElder
entered thestreet andatoncebestowed onhimanalms ofvictual anddrink.
Andwhen shehadbound him inthebonds ofthecraving oftaste, shegot

aninner chamber.
Intheduecourse ofhisround foralms attheproper time, theEldercame to
thedoor ofherhouse; andherpeople took theElder's bowlandmade him

When hehadseated himself, hesaid,"Where isthelay-sister?" "She's

AllthisWAH noised abroad. Sitting intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren
discussed thematter, saying, "Sirs, itisreported thataslave-girl hasbound

jewelled seat,and said,"What, Brethren, isthesubject ofdiscussion inthis
conclave?" They toldhimtheincident.
"Brethren," said he,"this isnotthe firsttime that, inbondage tothe
craving oftaste, hehasfollen intoherpower ;inbygone days toohefellintoher

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares hehada

Wind-antelope, which fledaway atthesight ofSafijaya, butthelatter let

antelope used toroam about inthepleasaunce. Now thegardener was
inthehabit ofgathering flowers andfruits andtaking them daybydayto
theking. Said tlieking tohimoneday, "Have younoticed anything
strange, friend gardener, inthepleasaunce 1""Only, sir,that aWind-
antelope hascome about thegrounds." "Could you catch it,doyou
think 1""Oh,yes ;ifIhadalittle honey, I'dbring itright intoyour

Theking ordered thehoney tobegiven tothemanandhewent oflT
with ittothepleasaunce, where hefirstanointed with thehoney thegrass
attliespots frequented bytheantelope, [158] andthen hidhimself.
When theantelope came andtasted thehonied grass itwassosnared by
thelustoftaste that itwould gonowhere elsebutonly tothepleasaunce.
Marking thesuccess ofhissnare, thegardener began gradually toshow

gathered confidence andgradually came toeatgrass from theman's hand.
He,noting that thecreature's confidence hadbeenwon, firststrewed the
path asthick asacarpet with broken boughs; then tying agourd full
ofhoney onhisshoulder andsticking abunch ofgrass inhiswaist-cloth,
hekeptdropping wisps ofthehonied grass infront oftheantelope tillat
lasthegot itright inside thepalace. Nosooner wastheantelope inside
than they shut thedoor. Atsight ofmen theantelope, infearand
trembling for its life,dashed toand froabout thehall; andtheking
coming down fi'om hischamber above, andseeing thetrembling creature,
said,"Sotimid istheWind-antelope that forawhole week itwillnot

town ofAjavl, many female lay-disciples and Sisters used toflock thither
tohear theTruth preached. Thepreaching w^as inthedaytime, l)utastime

wore on,thewomen didnotattend, andthere were onlyBrethren andmen
disciples present. Then thepreaching took place intheevening ;and at
theclose theElder Brethren retired each tohisownchamber. Buttheyounger
ones with thelay-disciples laydown torest intheService-hall. When they
fellasleep, loudwasthesnoring andsnorting andgnashing ofteeth asthey
lay. [161] After ashort slumber some gotup,andreported totheBlessed
Onetheimpropriety which theyhadwitnessed. Said he,"IfaBrother sleeps
inthecompany ofNovices, itisaPacittiya offence (requiring confession and
absolution)." And after delivering thisprecejjt hewentaway toKosambi.
Thereon theBrethren saidtotheReverend Bahula, "Sir, theBlessed Onehas
laiddown thisprecept, andnowyouwillplease findquarters ofyourown." Now,
before this,theBrethren, outofrespect forthefather andbecause oftheanxious
desire ofthesontoobserve therules oftheBrotherhood, hadwelcomed theyouth
asiftheplace were his;—theyhad fitted upalittle bedforhim,andhadgiven
himacloth tomake apillow with. Butonthedayofourstory theywould not
even givehimhouse-room, sofearful were they oftransgressing. The excellent
Rahula went neither totheBuddha asbeing hisfather, nortoSariputta, Captain
oftheFaith, asbeing hispreceptor, nortotheGreat Moggallana asbeing his
teacher, nortotheElderAnanda asbeing hisuncle;butbetook himself tothe
Buddha's jakes andtookuphisabode there asthough inaheavenly mansion.
Now inaBuddha's jakes thedoor isalways closely shut :thelevelled floor isof
perfumed earth ;flowers andgarlands arefestooned round thewalls;and all
night longalamp burns there. But itwasnotthissplendour which prompted
Rahula totakeuphisresidence here. Nay, itwassimply because theBrethren
hadtoldhim tofindquarters forhimself, andbecause hereverenced instruction
andyearned toobserve therules oftheOrder. Indeed, from time totime the
Brethren, totesthim,when theysawhimcoming from quite adistance, used to
throw down ahand-broom oralittle dust-sweepings, andthen askwhohad
thrown itdown, afterRahula hadcome in."Well, Rahula came thatway,"
would bethei-emark, butnever didthefuture Elder sayheknew nothing about
it.Onthecontrary, heused toremove thelitterandhumbly askpardon ofthe
Brother, norgoaway tillhewasassured thathewaspardoned; —soanxious was
hetoobserve therules. And itwassolely thisanxiety which madehimtakeup
hisdwelling inthejakes.
Now, though dayhadnotyetdawned, theMaster halted atthedoor of
thejakes andcoughed 'Ahem.' 'Ahem,' responded theReverend Rahula. "Who
isthere?" saidtheBuddha. "It isI,Rahula," wasthereply; andoutcame
theyoungmanandbowed low. "Whyhaveyoubeen sleeping here,Rahula?"
"Because Ihadnowhere togoto.Up tillnow, sir,theBrethren have been
verykind tome ;butsuch istheir present fearoferring [162] thattheywon't
givemeshelter anymore. Consequently, Itookupmyabode here, because
Ithought itaspotwhere Ishould notcome intocontact withanybody else."
Then thought theMaster tohimself, "Ifthey treat evenRahula like this,
what willthey notdotoother youths whom theyadmit totheOrderl" And
hisheart wasmoved within him fortheTruth. So,atanearly hourhehadthe
Brethren assembled, andquestioned theCaptain oftheFaith thus, "Isuppose
youatallevents, Sariputta, know where Rahula isnowquartered?'
"No, sir,Idonot."
"Sariputta, Rahula wasliving thisdayinthejakes. Sariputta, ifyoutreat
Rahula like this,what willnotbeyour treatment ofother youths whom you
admit totheOrder? Such treatment willnotretain thosewho join us.In
future, keep your Novices inyourown quarters foradayortwo,andonly
onthethird day letthem lodge out,taking care toacquaint yourself with their
lodging." With this rider, theMaster laiddown theprecept.
Gathering together intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren spoke ofthegoodness
ofRahula. "See, sirs,howanxious wasRahula toobserve therules. When
told tofind hisown lodging, hedidnotsay, 'IamthesonoftheBuddha;
what haveyoutodowith quarters ?Yoioturn out!
'No ;notasingle Brother
didheoust,butquartered himself inthejakes."

Astheywere talking thus, theMaster came totheHallandtook hisseaton
histhrone ofstate, saying, "What isthesubject ofyour talk,Brethren?"
"Sir," wasthe reply, "wewere talking oftheanxiety ofRahula tokeep
therules, nothing else."
Then said theMaster, "This anxiety Rahula hasshewn notonly now,
butalso inthepast,when hehadbeenbornananimal." And sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime acertain king ofMagadha wasreigning inRajagaha;
andinthose days theBodhisatta, liaving been born astag,wasliving in
theforest atthehead ofaherd ofdeer.Now hissister brought herson
tohim, saying, "Brother, teach yournephew here theruses ofdeer."
"Certainly," saidtheBodhisatta; "goaway now,myboy,andcome back
atsuchandsuch atime tobetaught." Punctually atthetime hisuncle
mentioned, theyoung stagwasthere andreceived instruction intheruses
ofdeer.
Onedayashewasranging thewoods hewascaught inasnare and
littered theplaintive cryofacaptive. Away fledtheherdandtoldthe
mother ofherson's capture. Shecame toherbrother andasked him
whether hisnephew hadbeen taught theruses ofdeer. "Fear not; [163]
your son isnotatfault," saidtheBodhisatta. "Hehaslearnt thoroughly
deer's ruses, and willcome back straightway toyour great rejoicing."
And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Inallthree postures—onhisback orsides—
Your son isversed ;he'strained touseeight hoofs*,
And save atmidnight never slakes histhirst;
Asheliescouched onearth, helifeless seems.
And only with hisunder-nostril breathes.
Sixtricks 2mynephew knows tocheat hisfoes.
[1G4] Thus didtheBodhisatta console hissister byshewing herhow
thoroughly hersonhadmastered theruses ofdeer. Meantime theyoung
stagonbeing caught inthesnare didnotstruggle, butlaydown atfull
length^ onhisside,with hislegsstretched outtautand rigid. Hepawed
uptheground round hishoofs soastoshower thegrass andearth about;
relieved nature ;lethishead fall ;lolled outhistongue;beslavered his
body allover; swelled himself outbydrawing inthewind ;turned uphis
eyes ;breathed onlywith thelower nostril, holding hisbreath with the
upper one ;andmade himself generally sorigidandsostiff" astolook like
