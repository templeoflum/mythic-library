PREFACE.
Itwasanalmost isolated incident inGreek literary history\
when Pythagoras claimed toremember hisprevious lives. Heracleides
Ponticus relates thatheprofessed tohavebeen onceborn as^tha-
lides, thesonofHermes, and tohave then obtained asaboon from
hisfather ^covra koIreXevrcopTa /u,v7]fir]v e^€Lv twvav/^^aivovrcov^.
Consequently heremembered theTrojan war,where, asEuphorbus,
hewaswounded byMenelaus, and, asPythagoras, hecould still
recognise theshield which Menelaus hadhungupinthetemple of
Apollo atBranchidse ;andsimilarly heremembered hissubsequent
birth asHermotimus, andthen asPyrrhus, afisherman ofDelos.
But inIndia this recollection ofprevious lives isacommon feature
inthehistories ofthesaints andheroes ofsacred tradition ;and itis
especially mentioned byManu^ asthe effect ofaself-denying and
pious life.The doctrine ofMetempsychosis, since thelater Vedic
period, hasplayed such animportant part inthehistory ofthe
national character andreligious ideas thatweneed notbesurprised
tofindthatBuddhist literature from the earliest times (although
giving atheory ofitsown toexplain thetransmigration) hasalways
included theages ofthepast asanauthentic background tothe
founder's historical lifeasGautama. Jataka legends occur even in
theCanonical Pitakas; thus theSukha-vihari Jataka and the
Tittira Jataka, which arerespectively the10thandthe37th inthis
volume, arefound intheCuUa Vagga, vii.1and vi.6,andsimilarly
theKhandhavatta Jataka, which willbegiven inthenextvolume, is
found intheCuUaVagga v.6;andthere areseveral other examples.
Sotoooneoftheminor books oftheSutta Pitaka (theCariya
Pitaka) consists of35Jatakas told inverse; and ten atleast

vi Preface.
ofthese canbeidentified inthevolumes ofourpresent collection
already published;andprobably several oftheothers willbetraced
when itisallprinted. TheSutta andVinaya Pitakas aregenerally
accepted asatleast older than theCouncil ofVesali (380 B.C. ?);
andthus Jataka legends must have been always recognised in
Buddhist literature.
This conclusion isconfirmed bythefactthatJataka scenes are
found sculptured inthecarvings onthe railings round the relic
shrines ofSanchi andAmaravati andespecially those ofBharhut^
where the titles ofseveral Jatakas are clearly inscribed over
some ofthe carvings. These bas-reliefs prove that the birth-
legends were widely known inthethird century B.C.andwere then
cousidered aspart ofthesacred history ofthe religion. Fah-hian,
when hevisited Ceylon, (400 A.D.), sawatAbhayagiri "representa-
tions ofthe500bodily forms which theBodhisatta assumed during
hissuccessive births'V' andheparticularly mentions hisbirths as
Sou-ta-nou, abright flash oflight, theking oftheelephants, andan
antelope*. These legends were alsocontinually introduced intothe
religious discourses* which were delivered bythevarious teachers in
thecourse oftheir wanderings, whether tomagnify theglory ofthe
Buddha ortoillustrate Buddhist doctrines andprecepts byappropriate
examples, somewhat inthesame way asmediaeval preachers in
Europe used toenliven their sermons byintroducing fables and
popular tales torouse theflagging attention oftheir hearers^
Itisquite uncertain when these various birth-stories were put
together inasystematic form such aswefind inourpresent Jataka
collection. At firstthey were probably handed down orally, but
theirgrowing popularity would ensure that their kernel, atany rate,
would erelong becommitted tosome more permanent form. In
factthere isasingular parallel tothis inthe'Gesta Romanorum',
which wascompiled byanuncertain author inthe14th century and
contains nearly 200 fables and stories told toillustrate various
virtues and vices, many ofthem winding upwith areligious
application.

Preface. vii
Some ofthebirth-stories areevidently Buddhistic andentirely
depend fortheir point onsomecustom oridea peculiar toBuddhism
;
butmany arepieces offolk-lore which have floated about theworld
forages asthestray waifs ofliterature andareliable everywhere to
beappropriated byanycasual claimant. Thesame stories may thus,
inthecourse oftheir longwanderings, come toberecognised under
widely different aspects, aswhen they areusedbyBoccaccio orPoggio
merely asmerry tales, orbysome Welsh bard toembellish king
Arthur's legendary glories, orbysome Buddhist samana ormediaeval
friar toaddpoint tohisdiscourse. Chaucer unwittingly puts a
Jataka story intothemouth ofhisPardonere when hetells histale
of'theryotoures three
';andanother appears inHerodotus asthe
popular explanation ofthesudden riseoftheAlcmajonidge through
Megacles' marriage with Cleisthenes' daughter andtherejection of
hisrival Hippocleides.
The Paliwork, entitled'theJataka ',the firstvolume ofwhich
isnowpresented tothereader inanEnglish form, contains 550
.fatakas orBirth-stories, which arearranged in22nipatas orbooks.
This division isroughly founded onthenumber ofverses (gathas)
which arequoted ineach story ;thus the firstbook contains
150 stories, each ofwhich onlyquotes oneverse, thesecond 100,each
ofwhich quotes two,thethirdandfourth 50each,which respectively
quote 3and 4,and soontothetwenty-first with 5stories, each of
which quotes 80verses, andthetwenty-second with10stories, each
quoting astill larger number. Each story opens with apreface
called thepacciippannavatthu or'story ofthepresent', which relates
theparticular circumstances intheBuddha's lifewhich ledhim to
tellthebirth-story andthus reveal some event inthelong series
ofhisprevious existences asabodhisatta orabeing destined toattain
Buddha-ship. Attheendthere isalways given ashort summary,
where theBuddha identifies thedifferent actors inthestory intheir
present births atthetime ofhisdiscourse,—itbeing anessential
condition ofthebook thattheBuddha possesses thesame power as
thatwhich Pythagoras claimed butwith afarmore extensive range,
since hecouldremember allthepastevents inevery being's previous
existences aswell asinhisown. Every story isalso illustrated by
oneormore gathas which areuttered bytheBuddha while stilla
Bodhisatta and soplaying hispart inthenarrative ;butsometimes
theverses areputinto hismouth astheBuddha, when they are
called abhisamhuddha-gatha.


viii Preface.
Some ofthese stanzas arefound inthecanonical book called the
Dhammapada ;andmany oftheJataka stories aregiven intheold
Commentary onthatbook butwith varying details, andsometimes
associated with verses which arenotgiven inourpresent Jataka
text. Tliismight seem toimply that there isnotnecessarily astrict
connexion between anyparticular story andtheverses which may
bequoted asitsmoral ;butinmost cases anapposite stanza would
ofcourse soon assert aprescriptive right toanynarrative which
itseemed specially toillustrate. Thelanguage ofthegathas is
much more archaic than that ofthestories ;and itcertainly seems
more probable tosuppose thatthey aretheolder kernel ofthework,
andthatthus initsoriginal form theJataka, liketheCariya-pitaka,
consisted only ofthese verses. Itisquite true that they are
generally unintelligible without thestory, butsuch iscontinually the
case with proverbial sayings ;thetraditional commentary passes by
word ofmouth inavarying form along with theadage, asinthe
well-known ov(ppovrU 'WTroKXeiSj} orourown'Hobson's choice',
untilsome author writes itdown inacrystallised form\ Occasionally
thesame birth-story isrepeated elsewhere inasomewhat varied
formandwith different verses attached toit ;andwesometimes find
thephrase itivitthdretabbam^, which seems toimply thatthenarrator
istoamplify thedetails athisdiscretion.
Thenative tradition inCeylon isthat theoriginal Jataka Book
consisted ofthegdthds alone, and that acommentary onthese,
containing the stories which they were intended toillustrate, was
written invery early times inSinghalese. This was translated
into Paliabout 430 A.u.byBuddhaghosa, who translated somany
oftheearly Singhalese commentaries into Pali; and after thisthe
Singhalese original was lost. The accuracy ofthis tradition has
been discussed byProfessor Rhys Davids intheIntroduction to
the firstvolume ofhis'Buddhist Birth Stories '';andwemay
safely adopt hisconclusion, that iftheprose commentary was
notcomposed byBuddhaghosa, itwascomposed notlong after-
wards;and asinanycase itwasmerely aredaction ofmaterials
1Wehaveaninteresting illustration oftheproverbial character ofsome ofthe
Jataka stories intheSaiikhya Aphorisms, iv.11,"hewho iswithout hoiie ishappy
likePingala," which finds itsexplanation inJat.330. Itisalso referred tointhe

handed down from very early times intheBuddhist community, itis
notaquestion ofmuch importance except forPali literary history.
Thegathas areundoubtedly old,andthey necessarily imply the
previous existence ofthe stories, though notperhaps intheexact
words inwhich wenowpossess them.
TheJatakas arepreceded inthePalitextbyalong Introduction,
theNidana-katha, which gives theBuddha's previous history both
before his last birth, and alsoduring hislast existence until he
attained thestate ofaBuddha\ Thishasbeen translated byProfessor
Rhys Davids, butasithasnodirect connexion with therest ofthe
work,wehave omitted itinourtranslation, which commences with
the first Birth-story.
Wehave translated the quasi-historical introductions which
always precede thedifferent birth-stories, asthey areanessential
partoftheplan oftheoriginal woik,—since they linkeach talewith
some special incident intheBuddha's life,which tradition venerates
astheoccasion when heissupposed tohave recalled theforgotten
scene ofalong past existence tohiscontemporaries. But itisan
interesting question forfuture investigation how farthey contain any
historical data. They appear atfirst sight toharmonise with the
framework ofthePitakas;butIconfess that Ihavenoconfidence in
their historical credibility,—theyseem tomerather thelaboured
invention ofalater age, likethelegendary history oftheearly
centuries ofancient Rome. But thisquestion willbemore easily
settled, whenwehavemade further progress inthetranslation.
TheJatakas themselves areofcourse interesting asspecimens
ofBuddhist literature ;buttheir foremost interest tousconsists in
their relation tofolk-lore andthelight which they often throw on
those popular stories which illustrate sovividly the ideas and
superstitions oftheearly times ofcivilisation. Inthisrespect they
possess aspecial value, as,although much oftheir matter ispeculiar
toBuddhism, they contain embedded with itanunrivalled collection
ofFolk-lore. They arealso fullofinterest asgiving avivid picture
ofthe social lifeandcustoms ofancient India. Such books as
Lieutenant-Colonel Sleeman's 'Rambles' orMrGrierson's 'Bihar
Peasant Life' illustrate them atevery turn. They form infactan
ever-shifting panorama ofthe village lifesuch asFah-hian and
Hiouen-thsang saw itinthe olddays before theMuhammadan

conquest, whenHindu institutions andnative ruleprevailed inevery
province throughout theland. Like allcollections ofearly popular
tales they are fullofviolence and craft, andbetray alowopinion of
woman;butoutbursts ofnobler feeling arenotwanting, torelieve
thedarker colours.
Professor Rhys Davids firstcommenced atranslation ofthe
Jataka in1880, butother engagements obliged him todiscontinue it
after onevolume hadappeared, containing theNidanakatha and
40stories. Thepresent translation hasbeen undertaken byaband
offriends whohope,byeachbeing responsible foradefinite portion,
tocomplete thewhole within areasonable time.Weareinfact

although wehave adopted somecommon principles oftranslation

intransliteration, wehave agreed toleave each individual translator,
within certain limits, afreehand inhisownwork. TheEditor only

sitting down. Likewise, those disciples ofother schools saluted theBuddha, and
took their seats closebythesideofAnatha-pindika,— gazing upon theMaster's
countenance, glorious asthefullmoon, upon hisexcellent presence endowed with
thesigns andmarks ofBuddhahood andencompassed toafathom's length with
light, "andupon therichglory thatmarks aBuddha, aglory which issued asit
were inpaired garlands, pairupon pair.
Then, though inthunderous tones asofayoung lionroaring intheRed
Valley orasofastorm-cloud intherainy season, bringing down asitwere the
Ganges oftheHeavens ^[96]andseeming toweave achaplet ofjewels,—yetina
voice ofeightfold perfection, thecharm ofwhich ravished theear,hepreached
tothem theTruth inadiscourse fullofsweetness and bright with varied
beauty.
They, after hearing theMaster's discourse, roseupwith hearts converted,
andwithduesalutation totheLord ofKnowledge, burst asunder theother
doctrines inwhich theyhadtaken refuge, andbetook themselves totheBuddha as
their refuge. Thenceforth without ceasing theyused togowithAnatha-pindika,
carrying intheirhands perfumes andgarlands andthelike, tohear theTruth in
theMonastery ;andtheyabounded incharity, kept theCommandments, andkept
theweekly fast-day.
Now theBlessed Onewentfrom Savatthi back toRajagaha again. Assoon
astheBuddha hadgone, theyburst asunder theirnew faith, andreturning to
theother doctrines astheir refuge, reverted totheir original state.
After some seven oreight months' stay, theBlessed Onecame back to
Jetavana. Once again toodidAnatha-pindika come with those friends ofhisto
theMaster, make hissalutation and offering ofperfumes andthelike,andtake
hisseatonone side.And thefriends alsosaluted theBlessed Oneandtook
their seats inlikemanner. Then didAnatha-pindika telltheBlessed Onehow,
when theBuddha haddeparted onhisalms-pilgrimage, hisfriends hadforsaken
their refuge fortheolddoctrines again, andhad reverted totheir original
state.
Opening thelotus ofhismouth, asthough itwereacasket ofjewels, scented
with scents divine and filled with divers perfumes byvirtue ofhishaving ever
spoken aright throiighoiit myriad feons, theBlessed Onemade hissweet voice
come forth, asheenquired:—"Isthereport truethatyou, disciples, haveforsaken
theThree Refuges ^fortherefuge ofother doctrines?"
Andwhen they, unable toconceal thefact,hadconfessed, saying, "It istrue.
Blessed One," then saidtheMaster, "Disciples, notbetween thebounds ofhelP
below andthehighest heaven above, notinalltheinfinite worlds that stretch
right and left, isthere theequal, much lessthesuperior, ofaBuddha inthe
excellences which spring from obeying theCommandments andfrom other
virtuous conduct."
Then hedeclared tothem theexcellences oftheThree Gems asthey are
revealed inthesacred texts, thefollowing amongst thenumber,—"Of allcreatures,
Brethren, whether footless &c.,ofthese theBuddha isthechief"; "Whatsoever
riches there beinthisorinother worlds &c."; and"Verily thechief ofthe
faithful &c." Thence hewent ontosay:—"No disciples, male orfemale, who
seek refuge intheThreeGems that areendowed with such peerless excellences,
areever reborn into hellandthelike states ;but, released from allrebirth
into states ofsuffering, they pass totheRealm ofDevas andthere receive great
glory. Therefore, inforsaking such arefuge forthat offered byother doctrines,
youhavegone astray."

thistriad isspoken ofasthe'Three Gems.'

places oftorment—aretemporary andeducational.

(And herethefollowing sacred texts should becited tomake itclear that
nonewho, tofindrelease andthesupreme good, have sought refuge intheThree
Gems, shcxU bereborn into states ofsuffering:—

Entire release ishisfrom every pain.)'-
ButtheMaster didnotendhisteaching tothem atthispoint ;forhewent
ontosay:—"Disciples, meditation onthethought oftheBuddha, meditation on
thethought oftheTruth, meditation onthethought oftheBrotherhood, this it
isthat givesEntry toandFruition oftheFirst, theSecond, theThird, andthe
Fourth Paths toBliss ^."Andwhen hehadpreached theTruth tothem inthese
andother ways, hesaid,"Inforsaking such arefuge asthis,youhave gone
astray."
(And herethegiftoftheseveral Paths tothosewhomeditate onthethought
oftheBuddha and sofoi-tli, should bemade clearbysuch scriptures asthe
following:—"One thing there is.Brethren, w4iich, ifpractised anddeveloped,
conduces toutter loathing oftheworld's vanities, tothecessation ofpassion, to
theendofbeing, topeace, toinsight, toenlightenment, toNirvana. What is
thisonething ?—Themeditation onthethought oftheBuddha.")
When hehadthus exhorted thedisciples, theBlessed One said,—"Sotooin
times past, disciples, themenwhojimiped tothefatuous conclusion thatwhat
wasnorefuge wasarealrefuge, fellaprey togoblins inademon-haunted wilder-
nessandwere utterly destroyed;whilst themenwho clave totheabsolute
andindisputable truth, prospered intheselfsame wilderness." Andwhen he
hadsaid this,hebecame silent.
Then, rising upfrom hisseatandsaluting theBlessed One, thelayman
Anatha-pindika burst into praises, andwith clasped hands raised inreverence to
hisforehead, spoke thus:—"It isclear tous,Sir,that inthese present days
these disciples were ledbyerror into forsaking thesupreme refuge. Butthe
bygone destruction ofthose opinionated ones intliedemon-haiuited wilderness,
andtheprospering ofthemenwho clave tothe trvith, arehidden from usand
known only toyou. [98]May itplease theBlessed One, asthough causing the
fullmoon toriseinthesky, tomake thisthing clear tous."

Then said theBlessed One:—"Itwas solely tobrush away theworld's
difficulties thatbythedisplay oftheTen Perfections^through myriad aeons
Iwonomniscience. Give earandhearken, asclosely asifyouwere filling atube
ofgoldwith lion's marrow."
"Having thus excited theTreasurer's attention, hemade clear thething that
re-birth hadconcealed from them, asthough hewere releasing the fullmoon
from theupper air,thebirthplace ofthesnows.
Onceonatime inthecityofBenares intheKasi country there was
akingnamed Brahmadatta. Inthose days theBodhisatta wasborn into
amerchant's family, andgrowing upinduecourse, used tojourney about
trading with fivehundred carts, travelling nowfrom east towestand
nowfromwest toeast. There was also atBenai-es another young mer-
chant, astupid blockhead, lacking resource.
Now atthetime ofourstory theBodhisatta hadloaded fivehundred
carts with costly wares ofBenares andhadgotthem allready tostart.
And sohadthefoolish young merchant too. Thought theBodhisatta,
"If this foolish young merchant keepsmecompany allalong, andthe
thousand carts travel along together, itwillbetoomuch fortheroad ;it
willbeahard matter togetwood, watei*, and soforth forthemen, or
grass fortheoxen. Either heorImust goonfirst." Sohesent forthe
other and laid hisview before him, saying, "The two ofuscan't travel
together; would yourather gofirstorlasf?" Thought theother, "There
willbemany advantages ifIgoonfirst. Ishallhave aroadwhich isnot
yetcutup ;myoxen willhave thepick ofthegrass ;mymen willhave
thepick oftheherbs forcurry ;thewater willbeundisturbed ;and,
lastly, Ishall fixmyown price forthebarter ofmygoods." Accordingly
hereplied, "Iwillgofirst,mydear sir." [99]
TheBodhisatta, ontheother hand, sawmany advantages ingoing last,
forheargued thus tohimself:—"Those whogofirst will level theroad
where itisrough, whilst Ishall travel along theroad theyhave already
travelled; their oxen willhave grazed offthecoarse oldgrass, whilst
mine willpasture onthesweet young growth which willspring upinits
place ;mymen willfindafreshgrowth ofsweet herbs forcurry where the
oldoneshavebeenpicked ;whei'e there isnowater, the firstcaravan will
have todigtosupply themselves, andweshall drink atthewells they
dug. Haggling over prices iskilling work ;whereas I,following later,
shall bartermywares attheprices theyhave already fixed." Accordingly,
seeing allthese advantages, hesaid totheother, "Then goyou first,my
dear sir."

loving-kindness, andequanimity. (See theCariyd Pitaka, pp.45—7ofthePali text

"Very well, Iwill," said thefoolish merchant. Ami heyoked his
carts and setout. Journeying along, helefthuman habitations behind
himandcame totheoutskirts ofthewilderness. (Now wildernesses areof
thefivefollowing kinds:—robber wildernesses, wild-beast wildernesses,
drought wildernesses, demon wildernesses, andfamine wildernesses. The
first iswhen theway isbeset byrobbers ;thesecond iswhen theway is
besetbylionsandother wild beasts ;thethird iswhen there isnobathing
orwater tobegot ;thefourth iswhen theroad isbeset bydemons ;and
the fifth iswhen noroots orother food aretobefound. And inthis
fivefold category thewilderness inquestion wasboth adrought, anda
demon, wilderness.) Accordingly thisyoung merchant took great big
water-jars onhis carts, and filling them with water, setout tocross
thesixty leagues ofdesert which laybefore him.Nowwhen hehad
reached themiddle ofthewilderness, thegoblin whohaunted itsaid
tohimself, "Iwillmake thesementhrow away their stock ofwater, and
devour them allwhen they arefaint." Sohe[100] framed byhismagic
power adelightful carriage drawn bypure white young bulls. With a
retinue ofsome tenortwelve goblins bearing bows and quivers, swords
andshields, herodealong tomeetthem likeamighty lordinthiscarriage,
with blue lotuses andwhite water-lilies wreathed round hishead, withwet
hairandwet clothes, andwithmuddy carriage- wheels. Hisattendants,
too,infrontandrearofhimwent along with their hairandclothes wet,
with garlands ofblue lotuses andwhite water-lilies ontheir heads, and
withbunches ofwhite lotuses intheir hands, chewing theesculent stalks,
anddripping withwater andmire.Now theleaders ofcaravans have the
following custom :whenever thewind blows intheir teeth, they rideon
infront intheir carriage with their attendants round them, inorder to
escape thedust ;butwhen thewind blows from behind them, then they
ride inlikefashion intherear ofthecolumn. And, asonthisoccasion
thewind wasblowing against them, theyoung merchant wasriding in
front. When thegoblin became aware ofthemerchant's approach, he
drew hiscarriage aside from thetrack andgreeted himkindly, asking him
whither hewasgoing. Theleader ofthecaravan toocaused hiscarriage to
bedrawn aside from thetrack soastoletthecarts pass by,whilst he
stayed bythewayandthus addressed thegoblin :"We arejustonour
wayfrom Benares, sir.But Iobserve thatyouhave lotuses andwater-
liliesonyour heads andinyour hands, andthatyour people arechewing
theesculent stalks, andthatyouare allmuddy anddripping with wet.
Pray did itrainwhile youwere ontheroad, anddidyoucome onpools
covered with lotuses andwater-lilies?"
Hereon thegoblin exclaimed, "What didyousay? Why, yonder
appears thedark-green streak ofthe forest, andthence onward there is
nothing butwater allthrough theforest. Itisalways raining there;the

lilies." Then asthelineofcarts [101] passed by,heasked where they
werebound fox-."Tosuchandsuchaplace," wasthereply. "And what

might youhave inthis lastcartwhich seems tomove asifitwere heavilj'

youfrom theother side. Butthere isnoneed for itnow, aswater is
abundant onahead. Sobreak thejarsandthrow thewater away, that
youmay travel easier." Andheadded, "Now continue onyourway, as
wehave stopped toolong already." Then hewent alittlewayfurther on,
tillhewasoutofsight, when hemade hiswayback tothegoblin-city
where hedwelt.
Such wasthefolly ofthat foolish merchant thathedidthegoblin's
bidding, andhadhisjarsbroken andthewater allthrown away,—without
saving somuch even aswould gointhepalm ofaman's hand. Then he
ordered thecarts todrive on.Not adrop ofwater didthey findon
ahead, and thirst exhausted themen. Alldaylong tillthesunwent
down they keptonthemarch ;butatsunset theyunyoked their carts
andmade alaager, tethering theoxen tothewheels. Theoxenhadno
water todrink, andthemennone tocook their ricewith ;andthe tii'ed-
outband sank totheground toslumber. But assoon asnight fell,
thegoblins came outfrom their city,andslew every single oneofthose
menandoxen; andwhen theyhaddevoured their flesh, leaving only
thebare bones, thegoblins departed. Thus wasthefoolish young mer-
chant thesolecause ofthedestruction ofthatwhole band, whose skeletons
werestrewn inevery conceivable direction, whilst the fivehundred carts
stood there with their loads untouched.
Now theBodhisatta allowed some sixweeks topassbyafter the
starting ofthefoolish young mei'chant, before hesetout.Then hepro-
ceeded from the citywith hisfivehundred carts, and indue course
came totheoutskirts ofthewilderness. Here hehad hiswater-jars
tilled and laid inanample stock ofwater ;andbybeat ofdrum hehad
hismenassembled incamp [102], andthus addressed them:—"Let notso
much asapalmful ofwater beused without mysanction. There are
poison trees inthis wilderness; soletnomanamong youeatany leaf,
flower, orfruitwhich hehasnoteaten before, without firstasking me."
With thisexhortation tohismen, hejjushed onintothewilderness with
his500 carts. When hehadreached themiddle ofthewilderness, the
goblin made hisappearance ontheBodhisatta's path asintheformer case.
But, assoon ashebecame aware ofthegoblin, theBodhisatta sawthrough
him; forhethought tohimself, "There's nowater here, inthis'Waterless
Desert.' This person with hisredeyesandaggressive bearing, casts no
shadow. Very likely hehasinduced thefoolish young merchant who


No. 1. 7
preceded me,tothrow away all liiswater, andthen, waiting tilltheywere
worn out,haseaten upthemerchant with allhismen. Buthedoesn't
knowmycleverness andready wit." Then heshouted tothegoblin,
"Begone !We're men ofbusiness, anddonotthrow awaywhat water we
have got,before weseewhere more istocome from. But,whenwedosee
more,wemaybetrusted tothrow thiswater away andlighten ourcarts."
Thegoblin rodeonabitfurther tillhewasoutofsight, andthen
betook himself back tohishome inthedemon city. Butwhen thegoblin
hadgone, theBodhisatta's men said tohim, "Sir,weheard from those
men thatyonder isthedark-green streak oftheforest appearing, where
they said itwasalways raining. Theyhadgotlotuses ontheir heads and
water-lilies intheirhands andwere eating thestalks, whilst their clothes
andhairwere wringing wet,with water streaming offthem. Letusthrow
away ourwater andgetonabitquicker with lightened carts." Onhearing
these words, theBodhisatta ordered ahaltandhadthemen allmustered.
"Tell me," saidhe;"didanymanamong youever hear before today that
there wasalake orapool inthis wilderness'?" "No, sir,"was the
answer, "why it'sknown as'theWaterless Desert'."
"Wehave justbeen toldbysome people that itisraining justonahead,
inthebelt offorest; nowhow fardoes arain-wind carry /"[103]"A
league, sir." "Andhasthisrain-wind reached anyonemanhere1""No,

ning?" "Four orfiveleagues, sir.""And hasanyoneman here seen
aHash oflightning?" "No, sir.""How faroffcanaman hear apeal

They willreturn inthehope ofdevom-ing uswhenweareweak andfaint
afterthrowing away ourwater attheir bidding. Astheyoung merchant
whowentonbefore uswasnotaman ofresource, most likely hehasbeen
fooled intothrowing hiswater away andhasbeendevoured when exhaus-
tionensued. Wemayexpect tofindhisfivehundred carts standing just
astheywere loaded forthestart ;weshallcome onthem today. Press on
with allpossible speed, without throwing away adrop ofwater."
Urging hismenforward with these words, heproceeded onhisway till
hecameupon the500carts standing justastheyhadbeenloaded andthe
skeletons ofthemenandoxen lying strewn inevery direction. Hehad
hiscartsunyoked andranged inacircle soastoform astrong laager ;he
sawthat hismenandoxenhadtheir supper early, andthattheoxenwere
made toliedown inthemiddle with themenround them ;andhehimself

morrow atdaybreak when hehadhadhisoxen fedandeverything needful
done, hediscarded hisownweak carts forstronger ones, and hisown
common goods forthemost costly ofthederelict goods. Then hewenton
tohisdestination, where hebai-tered hisstock forwares oftwice orthree
times their value, andcame back tohisown citywithout losing asingle
manoutofallhiscompany.
[104] This story ended, theMaster said,"Thus itwas,layman, that in
times pastthefatuous came toutter destruction, whilst thosewhoclave tothe
truth, escaping from thedemons' hands, reached their goal insafety andcame
back totheirhomes again." Andwhen hehadthus linked thetwo stories
together, he,astheBuddha, spoke thefollowing stanza forthepurposes ofthis
lesson ontheTinith:—
Then some declared the sole, thepeerless truth;
Butotherwise thefalse logicians spake.
Lethimthat 'swisefrom thisalesson take,
And firmly grasp the sole, thepeerless truth.
[105] Thus didtheBlessed Oneteach thislesson respecting Truth. And
hewent ontosay:"What iscalled walking bytruth, notonly bestows the
threehappy endowments, thesixheavens oftherealms ofsense, andtheendow-
ments ofthehigher Realm ofBrahma, but finally isthegiver ofArahatship
[106]; whilst what iscalled walking byuntruth entails re-birth inthefour
states ofpunishment orinthelowest castes ofmankind." Further, theMaster
went ontoexpound insixteen ways theFour Truthsi,attheclose ofwhich all
those fivehundred disciples were established intheFruit oftheFirst Path2.
Having deUvered hislesson andhisteaching, andhaving toldthetwostories
andestablished theconnexion linking them together, theMaster concluded by
identifying theBirth asfollows:—"Devadatta wasthefoolish young merchant
ofthose days ;hisfollowers were thefollowers ofthatmerchant ;thefollowers of
theBuddha were thefollowers ofthewisemerchant, whowasmyself."
^These fourcardinal truths ofBuddhism areasfollows:—(i)individual existence
ispaiu; (ii)cravings cause thecontinuance ofindividual existence; (iii)with the
disappearance ofcravings, individual existence alsowould disappear; and (iv)cravings
disappear byfollowing theNoble Eightfold Path pointed outbytheBuddha. (See
hereon Rhys Davids' Hibbert Lecture for1881.)
"Thenormal road totheBuddhist ideal after conversion isdivided into four
successive stages, called thecattdro maggd or'four paths.' The firstofthese isthat
trodden bythesotdpanno (one'who hasentered thestream' which flowsdown tothe
ocean ofNirvana), who isassured ofultimately reaching hisgoal buthas first to
undergo seven more existences none ofwhich canbeinastate ofsuffering ;thesecond
path isthattrodden bythesakaddgdmi, thedisciple whose imperfections have been
sofareradicated thathehasonly to'return' toahuman-form oncemore before
attaining Nirvana ;thethird path isthat oftheanagdnu, thedisciple who will'not
return 'toearth, butwillattain thegoalfrom aBrahma realm;whilst thefourth and
last isArahatshiji, which isNirvana. Each ofthese four stages isfurther subdivided
intotwo sub-stages, thelower called 'the path,' andthehigher 'the fruit.' (See
Maha-parinibbana Sutta audthecommentary thereon oftheSumangala Vilasini.)

"Untiring, deep theyo?;/^."— This discourse wasdelivered bytheBlessed One
whilst hewasdwelling atSavatthi.
About wliom, youask ?
About aBrother whogaveuppersevering.
Tradition says that, whilst theBuddha wasdwelling atSavatthi, therecame
toJetavana ascion ofaSavatthi family, who, onhearing adiscourse bythe
IMaster, realised thatLusts breed suftering, andwasadmitted tothe firststage
oftheBrotherhood. After fiveyears passed inpreparing foradmission tofull
Brotherhood 1,when hehadlearnt twosummaries andhadtrained himself in
themethods ofInsight, heobtained from theMaster atheme formeditation
which commended itself tohim. Retiring toaforest, hepassed there the
rainy season ;but forallhisstriving during thethree months, hecould not
develope aglimmer oraninkling ofInsight. Sothethought came tohim,
"The Master said there were four types ofmen, and Imust belong tothe
lowest ofall; inthis birth, methinks, there isneither Path norFruit forme.
What good shall Idobyliving intheforest ?Back totheMaster Iwillgo,and
livemy lifebeholding theglories oftheBuddha's presence andlistening tohis
sweet teachings." Andback again toJetavana hecame.
Now hisfriends andintimates said, "Sir, itwasyouwhoobtained from the
Master atheme formeditation anddeparted tolivethesolitary lifeofasage.
Yethereyouareback again, going about enjoying fellowship. Can itbethat
youhavewonthecrown oftheBrotlier's vocation andthatyouwillneverknow
re-birth'?" "Sirs, asIwon neither Path norFruit, Ifeltmyself doomed to
futility, andsogaveuppersevering andcame back." "You have done wrong.
Sir,inshewing afaint heartwhenyouhaddevoted yourself tothedoctrine ofthe
dauntless Master. [107] Come, letusbring youtotheBuddha's notice." And
theytookhimwiththem totheMaster.
^Theterms pabhajjd andupasampadd, which denote thetwostages ofinitiation

10 TheJataha. Book I.
When theMaster became aware oftheir coming, hesaid, "Jirethren, you
bring withyouthisBrother against hiswill. AVhat hashedone?"
"Sir, after devoting himself tosoabsolutely trueadoctrine, thisBrother has
given \\\)persevering inthesolitary lifeofasage,and iscome back."
Then saidtheMaster tohim, "Is ittrue, asthey say,that you. Brother,
have given uppersevering?" "It istrue. Blessed One." "But howcomes it
that, after devoting yourself tosuch adoctrine, you,Brother, should betheoneto
show yourself notaman desiring little, contented, solitary, anddetermined, but
aman lacking perseverance'(Was itnotyouwhowere sostout-hearted in
bygone days (Was itnotbyyousingle-handed, thanks toyour perseverance,
tliat inasandy desert themenandtheoxen belonging toacaravan offive
hiuidred carts gotwater andwere cheered ?Andhow isitthat, now,youare
giving in?"These woi'ds sufficed togiveheart tothatBrother.
Hearing this talk, theBi-ethren asked theBlessed One, saying, "Sir, the
present faintheartedness ofthisBrother isclear tous ;buthidden from usisthe
knowledge ofhow,bytheperseverance ofthis single man, themenandoxen got
water inasandy desert andwere cheered. This isknown only toyouwhoare
omniscient;pray tellusabout it."
"Hearken, then, Bi'ethren," saidtheBlessed One; and,having excited their
attention, hemade clear thething that re-birth hadconcealed fromthem.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasking inBenares inKasi the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoatrader's family. When hewasgrown u}),he
used totravel about trading with500 carts. Ononeoccasion hecame
toasandy wilderness sixty leagues across, thesand ofwhich was sofine
that,when graspctl, itslipped through thefingers oftheclosed fist.Assoon
asthesungotup,itgrew ashotasabedofcharcoal-embers andnobody
could walkupon it.Accordingly, those traversing itused totake fire-
wood, water, oil,riceand soforth ontheir carts, andonly travelled by
night. Atdawn they used torange their carts inacircle toform a
laager, withanawning spread overhead, and after anearly meal used to
sitintheshade alltheday long. When thesunwent down, theyhad
their evening meal ;and, sosoon astheground became cool, theyused to
yoke their carts andmove forward. Travelling onthis desert was like
voyaging over thesea; a'desert-pilot,' ashewas called, had toconvoy
them overbyknowledge ofthestars [108]. And thiswastheway in
which ourmerchant wasnow travelling thatwilderness.
When hehadonlysome seven more miles before him, hethought to
himself, "To-night will seeusoutofthissandy wilderness." So,after
theyhadhadtheir supper, heordered thewood andwater tobethrown
away, andyoking hiscarts, setoutontheroad. Inthefront cartsatthe
pilotupon acouch looking uptothestars intheheavens and directing
thecourse thereby. Butsolonghadhebeen without sleep thathewas
tired outand fellasleep, with tJieresult thathedidnotmark that the
oxen hadturned round andwere retracing their stejjs. Allnight the
oxenkeptontheir way,butatdawn thepilotwoke up,and,observing the
disposition ofthestars overhead, shouted out, "Turn thecarts round !


No. 2. 11
turu thecarts round !"And asthey turned thecarts round andwere
forming them into line, thedaybroke. "Why this iswhere wecamped
yesterday," cried thepeople ofthecaravan. "Allourwood andwater is
gone, andwearelost." Sosaying, theyunyoked their carts andmade a
laager andspread theawning overhead ;then eachman flung himself
down indespair beneath hisown cart. Thought theBodhisatta tohimself,
"IfIgive in,every single one will perish." Soheranged toand fro
while itwas stillearlyand cool, untilhecame onaclump ofkusa-grass.
"This grass," thought he,"can onlyhavegrown upherethanks tothe
2>resence ofwater underneath." Soheordered aspade tobebrought and
ahole tobedugatthat spot. Sixty cubits down they dug, tillatthat
depth thespade struck onarock, andeverybody lost heart. Butthe
Bodhisatta, feeling sure there must bewater under that rock, de-
scended intotheholeandtook hisstand upon therock. Stooping down, he
applied hiseartoit,and listened. Catching thesound ofwater flowing
beneath, hecame outand said toaserving-lad, "Myboy, ifyougive in,
weshall allperish. Sotake heart andcourage. Godown intothehole
with thisironsledge-hammer, andstrike therock."
Obedient tohismaster's bidding, [109] the lad, resolute where all
others had lost heart, wentdown andstruck therock. Therockwhich
haddammed thestream, split'asunder and fell in.Uprosethewater in
thehole till itwas ashigh asapalm-tree ;andeverybody drank and
bathed. Then they chopped uptheir spare axles andyokes andother
surplus gear, cooked their riceand ate it,andfedtheir oxen. And as
soon asthesun set,they hoisted aflagbytheside ofthewelland
travelled ontotheir destination. There they bartered away their goods
fortwice andfourtimes their value. With theproceeds theyreturned to
theirownhome, where they lived outtheir term oflifeandintheend
passed away tofarethereafter according totheir deserts. TheBodhisatta
tooafter alifespent incharity andother good works, passed away likewise
tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
When theSupreme Buddha haddelivered thisdiscourse, he,theAll-Knowing
Onehimself, uttered thisstanza:—
Untiring, deep theydugthatsandy ti-ack
Till, inthetrodden way, they water found.
Soletthesage, iuperseverance strong.
Flag notnor tire, until hisheart find Peace.
[110] This discourse ended, hepreached theFour Truths, atthe close
v-'hereof thefainthearted Brother wasestablished inthehighest Fruit ofall,
which isArahatship.
Having toldthese two stories, theMaster established theconnexion linking
them both together, and identified theBirth bysaying:—"This fainthearted
Brother ofto-day was inthose days theserving-lad who, persevering, broke the
rockandgave water toallthepeople ;theBuddha's followers were therestof
thepeople ofthecaravan; and Imyself wastheir leader."

SERIVANIJA- JATAK A.
"//"inthisfaith." This lesson toowastaught bytheBlessed One while
atSiivatthi, alsoabout aBrother whogaveuppersevering.
For,when themanwasbrought bytheBrethren exactly asintheforegoing
case, theMaster said, "You, Brother, who after devoting yourself tothisglorious
doctrine which bestows PathandFruit, [111] aregiving ujjpersevering, willsuffer
long, likethehawker ofSeriwho lostagolden bowlworth ahundred thousand
pieces."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this tothem. TheBlessed
Onemade clearathing concealed fromthem byre-birth.
Once onatime inthekingdom ofSeri, fiveaeons ago,theBodhisatta
dealt inpotsandpans, andwas called'theSerivan.' Inthecompany of
another dealer inthesame wares, agi-eedy fellow whowasalsoknown
as'theSerivan,' hecame across theriver Telavaha andentered thecity
ofAndhapura. Apportioning thestreets between thetwo ofthem, he
setabout hawking hiswares round thestreets ofhisdistrict, andthe
other did tliesame inhisdistrict.
Now inthat citythere was adecayed family. Once theyhadbeen
richmerchants, butbythetime ofourstory theyhad lost allthesonsand
brothers and alltheir wealth. The solesurvivors were agirlandher
grandmother, andthey gottheir living byworking forhire. Nevertheless,
theyhadgotintheir house thegolden bowl outofwhich intheolddays
thegreat merchant, thehead ofthefamily, used toeat ;but ithadbeen
thrown among thepotsandpans, andhaving been long outofuse,was
grimed overwith dirt, sothat thetwowomen didnotknow that itwas
gold. Tothedoor oftheir house came thegreedy hawker onhisround,
crying, "Waterpots tosell !Waterpots tosell !"And thedamsel, when
sheknew hewas there, said tohergrandmother, "Oh,dobuymea
ti'inket, grandmother."
"We're very poor, dear; what canweoffer inexchange forit?"
"Why here's this bow^lwhich isnogood tous.Letnschange that
forit."
Theoldwoman hadthehawker bi'ought inandseated, andgavehim
thebowl, saying, "Take this, sir,andbesogood astogiveyour sister
something orother inexchange."
Thehawker took thebowl inhishand, turned itovei', and,suspecting
itwasgold ,scratched alineontheback ofitwith aneedle, whereby he


No. 3. 13
knew forcertain that itwasreal gold. Then, thinking thathewould get
thepotwithout giving anything whatever for ittothewomen, hecried,
"What's thevalue ofthis,pray 1Why itisn'tworth halfafarthing!"[112]
And therewithal hethrew thebowlontheground, roseupfrom hisseat,
and leftthehouse. Now, asithadbeen agreed between thetwohawkers
thattheonemight ti-ythestreets which theother hadalready been into,
theBodhisatta came intothatsame street andappeared atthedoor ofthe
house, crying, "Waterpots tosell !"Once again thedamsel made thesame
request ofhergrandmother ;andtheoldwoman replied, "Mydear, the
firsthawker threw ourbowl ontheground andflung outofthehouse.
What havewegotlefttooffernow1"
"Oh,butthathawker wasaharsh-spoken man, grandmother dear;
whilst thisonelooks anicemanandspeaks kindly. Very likely hewould
take it." "Callhiminthen." Sohecame intothehouse, andtheygave
himaseatandputthebowl into hishands. Seeing that thebowlwas
gold, hesaid, "Mother, thisbowl isworth ahundred thousand pieces ;I
haven't itsvalue with me."
"Sir,the firsthawker whocame here saidthat itwasnotworth halfa
farthing;sohethrew ittotheground andwentaway. Itmust havebeen
theefficacy ofyourowngoodness which hasturned thebowl into gold.
Take it;giveussomething orother for it ;andgoyour way." Atthe
time theBodhisatta had500pieces ofmoney andastock worth asnnich
more. Thewhole ofthishegave tothem, saying, "Letmeretainmy
scales,mybag,andeight pieces ofmoney." And with their consent he
took these with him,anddeparted with allspeed totheriver-side where he
gave hiseight coins totheboatman andjumped into the boat. Sub-
sequently thatgreedy hawker hadcome back tothehouse, andhadasked
them tobring outtheir bow], saying hewould givethem something or
other for it.But theoldwoman flew out athimwith these words,
"You made outthatourgolden bowlwhich isworth ahundred thousand
pieces wasnotworth even ahalf-farthing. Butthere came anupright
hawker (your master, Itake it),whogave usathousand pieces for itand
took thebowlaway."
Hereupon heexclaimed, "Hehasrobbed meofagolden bowl worth
afullhundred thousand pieces; hehascaused meaterrible loss." And
intense soitow came upon him, sothathelostcommand overhimself and
became likeonedistraught. [113] Hismoney andgoods heflungaway at
thedoor ofthehouse;hethrew offhisupper andunder cloths ;and,
armed with thebeam ofhisscales asaclub, heti'acked theBodhisatta
down totheriver-side. Finding thelatter already crossing, heshouted to
theboatman toputback, buttheBodhisatta toldhimnottodoso.As
theother stood there gazing andgazing attheretreating Bodhisatta, intense
sorrow seized upon him. Hisheartgrew hot; blood gushed from hislips;


14 TheJataka. Book I.
andhisheart cracked likethemud atthebottom ofatank, which thesun
hasdried up.Through thehatred which liehadcontracted against the
Bodhisatta, lieperished theuandthere. (This wasthe firsttimeDevadatta
conceived agrudge against theBodhisatta.) TheBodhisatta, after alife
spent incharity andother good woi'ks, passed away tofare accoi'ding to
hisdeserts.
When theSuj^reme Buddha hadended thi.s lesson, he,theAll-Knowing One
himself, uttered thisstanza:—
Ifinthis faith youprove remiss, and fail
Towinthegoalwhereto itsteachings lead,—Then, likethehawker called 'the Serivan^,'
Full long you'll ruetheprize your folly lost.
After having thus delivered hisdiscourse insuch away astoleadupto
Arahatship, theMaster expounded theFour Truths, attheclose whereof the
fainthearted Brother was established inthat highest Fruit ofall,which is
Arahatship.
And, after telling thetwo stories, theMaster made theconnexion linking
them both together, and identified theBirth bysaying inconclusion, "Inthose
days Devadatta wasthefoolish hawker; and Imyself wasthewiseandgood

Elder named LittleWayman, while inJivaka's Mango-grove^ near Rajagaha.
And hereanaccount ofLittleWayman's birthmust begiven. Tradition tells
usthatthedaughter ofarichmerchant's family inRajagaha actually stooped to

shesaidtotheslave, "Wecan't liveonhere ;forifmymother andfather come

hardly-o})ened door, and fledaway, they cared notwhither, tofindashelter
beyond thekenofherfamily. Then theywentand lived together inacertain
place, with theresult thatsheconceived. Andwhen her fulltimewasnearly

agreed tostart to-day, andthenheput itoff tillthemorrow ;andsoheletthe
days slipby, tillshethought toherself, "This fool issoconscious ofhisgreat
offence thathedares notgo.One's parents areone's best friends;sowhether
hegoes orstays, Imust go." So,when hewent out,sheput allherhousehold
matters inorder andsetoffhome, telling hernext-door neighbour where shewas
going. Returning home, andnotfinding hiswife, butdiscovering from the
neighbours thatshehadstarted offhome, hehurried after herandcameupwith
herontheroad ;andthenandthere shewastaken inlabour.
"What's this,mydearl" said he.
"Ihave given birth toason,myhusband," said she.
Accordingly, astheverything hadnowhappened which wastheonlyreason
forthejourney, they both agreed that itwasnogood going onnow,and so
turned back again. And astheir childhadbeen bornbytheway,they called
him'Wayman.'
[115] Notlong after, shebecame with child again, andeverything fellout
asbefore. And asthissecond child toowasbornbytheway,they called him
'Wayman' too,distinguishing theelder as'Great Wayman' andtheyounger as
'Little Wayman.' Then, withboth their children, theyagain wentback totheir
ownhome.
Now, astheywere living there, their way-child heard other boys talking of
their uncles andgrandfathers andgrandmothers ;soheasked hismother whether
hehadn't gotrelations liketheother boys. "Oh yes,mydear," said hismother;
"but they don't live here. Your grandfather isawealthy merchant inthecity
ofRajagaha, andyouhave plenty ofrelations there." "Why don'twegothere,
mother?" She told theboythereason whythey stayed away; but, asthe
children keptonspeaking about these relations, shesaid toherhusband, "The
children arealways plaguing me.Aremyparents going toeatusatsight?
Come, letusshew thechildren their grandfather's family." "Well, Idon'tmind
taking them there;but Ireally could notfaceyour parents." "All right;—so
long as,somewayorother, thechildren come toseetheir grandfather's family,"
said she.
Sothose twotook their children andcoming induecourse toRajagaha put
upinapublic rest-house bythecity gate. Then, taking withthem thetwo
children, thewoman caused their coming tobemadeknown toherparents.
The latter, onhearing themessage, returned thisanswer, "True, itisstrange to
bewithout children unless onehasrenounced theworld inquest ofArahatship.
Still, sogreat istheguilt ofthepairtowards usthattheymaynotstand inour
sight. Here isasum ofmoney forthem :letthem take thisand retire tolive
where they will. Butthechildren theymaysend here." Then themerchant's
daughter took themoney sosent her,anddespatched thechildren bythe
messengers. Sothechildren grew upintheir grandfather's house,—LittleWayman being oftender years, while GreatWayman used togowith hisgrand-
father tohear theBuddha preach theTruth. Andbyconstant hearing ofthe
Truth from theMaster's own lips,thelad's heart yearned torenounce theworld
forthe lifeofaBrother.
"With your permission," saidhetohisgrandfather, "Ishould liketojointhe
Brotherhood." "What doIhear?" cried theoldman. "Why, itwould giveme
greater joytoseeyoujointheOrder than toseethewhole world join. Become
aBrother, ifyou feelable." AndhetookhimtotheMaster.
"Well, merchant," saidtheMaster, "have youbrought yourboywithyou?"
"Yes, sir; this ismygrandson, whowishes tojoinyour Brotherhood." [116]
Then theMaster sent foraMendicant, andtoldhim toadmit theladtothe

gave himself uj)toearnest thought tillhewonArahatship ;andashepassed his
days intheenjoyment ofInsight andthePaths, hethought whether hecould
notimpart thelikehappiness toLittleWayman. Sohewent tohisgrandfather
themerchant, and said,"Great merchant, withyour consent, Iwilladmit Little
Wayman totheOrder." "Pray doso,reverend sir,"wasthereply.
Then theElder admitted theladLittleWayman andestablished him inthe
TenCommandments. ButLittleWayman proved adullard :with fourmonths'
study hefailed togetbyheart thissingle stanza:—
Lo !likeafragrant lotus atthedawn
Ofday, full-blown, with virgin wealth ofscent,
Behold theBuddha's glory shining forth,
Asinthevaulted heaven beams thesun !
For,wearetold, intheBuddhahood ofKassapa thisLittleWayman, having
himself attained toknowledge asaBrother, laughed toscorn adullBrother who
waslearning apassage byheart. Hisscorn soconfused hisbutt, thatthelatter
could notlearn orrecite thepassage. Andnow, inconsequence, onjoining the
Brotherhood hehimself proved adullard. Eachnew linehelearned drove the
lastoutofhismemory ;andfourmonths slipped away while hewasstruggling
with this single stanza. Said hiselder brother tohim,"Wayman, youarenot
equal toreceiving thisdoctrine. Lifourwhole months youhavebeenunable to
learn asingle stanza. How then canyouhope tocrown your vocation with
sui)reme success ?Leave themonastery." But,though thus expelled byhis
brother. LittleWayman wassoattached totheBuddha's creed thathedidnot
want tobecome alayman.
Now atthat time GreatWayman was acting assteward. And Jivaka
Komarabhacca, going tohismango-grove with alarge present ofperfumes and
flowers fortheMaster, hadpresented hisoftering andlistened toadiscourse;
then, rising from hisseatandbowing totheBuddha, hewent uptoGreat
Wayman andasked,"How many Brethren arethere, reverend sir,with the
Master?" "Just 500, sir." "Will youbring the500Brethren, with theBuddha
attheir head, totake their meal atmyhouse to-morrow?" "Lay-disciple, one
ofthemnamed LittleWayman isadullard andmakes noprogress intheFaith,"
saidtheElder ;"Iaccept theinvitation foreveryone buthim."
[117] Hearing this. LittleWayman thought tohimself, "Inaccepting the
invitation forallthese Brethren, theElder carefully accepts soastoexclude me.
Thisproves thatmybrother's affection formeisdead. What have Itodowith
thisFaith 'IIwillbecome alayman and liveintheexercise ofcharity andother
good works ofalaycharacter." And onthemorrow early hewent forth,
avowedly tobecome alayman again.
Now atthe firstbreak ofday, ashewassurveying theworld, theMaster
became aware ofthis; andgoing forth even earlier than Little Wayman, he
paced toandfrobytheporch onLittleWayman's road. Asthelatter came out
ofthehouse, heobserved theMaster, andwith asalutation wentuptohim.
"Whither away atthishour, LittleWayman ?"saidtheMaster.
"My brother hasexpelled mefrom theOrder, sir ;and Iamgoing towander
forth."
"Little Wayman, asitwasunder methatyoutook thevows,why didyou
not,when expelled byyour brother, come tome ?Come, what haveyoutodo
with alayman's life IYou shall stopwith me." Sosaying, hetook Little
Wayman andseated him atthedoor ofhisownperfumed chamber. Then
giving him aperfectly clean cloth which hehadsupernaturally created, the
Master said,"Face towards theEast, andasyouhandle this cloth, repeat these
words—'Removal ofImj^urity; Removal ofImpuritj'.'" Then atthetime
appointed theMaster, attended bytheBrotherhood, went toJivaka's house and
satdown ontheseat setforhim,


No. 4. 17
Now LittleWayman, with hisgaze fixed onthesun, sathandling thecloth
andrepeating thewords, "Removal ofImpurity; Removal ofImpurity." And
ashekepthandling thepiece ofcloth, itgrew soiled. Then hethought, "Just
now this piece ofcloth wasquite clean ;butmypersonality hasdestroyed its
original state andmade itdirty. Impermanent indeed are allcompounded
things!"And even asherealised Death andDecay, hewon theArahat's
Illumination. Knowing that LittleWayman's mind hadwonIllumination, the
Master sent forth anapparition andinthissemblance ofhimself appeared before
him, asifseated infront ofhimandsaying, "Heed itnot, LittleWayman, that
thismere piece ofcloth hasbecome dirty andstained with impurity ;within
thee aretheimpurities oflustandother evilthings. Remove them." Andthe
apparition uttered these stanzas:—
Impurity inLust consists, notdirt;
AndLustweterm therealImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
Helives thegospel ofthe Pui'ified.
[118] Impurity inWrath consists, notdirt;
AndWrath weterm therealImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
ITelives thegospel ofthePurified.
Delusion isImpurity, notdirt;
Weterm Delusion realImpurity.
Yea, Brethren, whoso drives itfrom hisbreast,
ffelives thegospel ofthePurified.
Attheclose ofthese stanzas LittleWayman attained toArahatship with the
fourbranches ofknowledgei,whereby hestraightway came tohaveknowledge of
allthesacred texts. Tradition has itthat, inages past,when hewasakingand
wasmaking asolemn procession round hiscity,hewiped thesweat from his
brow with aspotless cloth which hewaswearing; andthecloth was stained.
Thought he,"Itisthisbody ofminewhich hasdestroyed theoriginal i>urity and
whiteness ofthecloth, and dirtied it.Impermanent indeed are allcomposite
things." Thus hegrasped theideaofimpermanence ;andhence itcame topass
that itwastheremoval ofimpurity which worked hissalvation.
Meantime, Jivaka Komarabhacca ofi'ered theWater ofDonation'-; butthe
Master puthishand over thevessel, saying, "Are there noBrethren, Jivaka, in
themonastery?"
SaidGreatWayman, "There arenoBrethren there, reverend sir.""Oh yes,
there are,Jivaka," saidtheMaster. "Hi, there!"saidJivaka toaservant ;"just
yougoandseewhether ornotthere areanyBrethren inthemonastery."
Atthatmoment Little Wayman, conscious ashewasthat hisbrother was
declaring there werenoBrethren inthemonastery, determined toshewhim
there were, and sofilled thewhole mango-gi'ove with nothing butBrothers.
Some weremaking robes, others dyeing, whilst others again were repeating the
sacred texts:—each ofathousand Brethren hemade unlike alltheothers.
Finding thishost ofBrethren inthemonastery, theman returned and said
thatthewhole mango-grove was fullofBrethren.
Butasregards theElder upinthemonastery—
Wayman, athousand-fold self-multiplied.
Saton, tillbidden, inthat pleasant grove.
^These fourbranches were (i)understanding ofthesense ofthesacred books,
(ii)understanding oftheir ethical truth, (iii) ability tojustify aninterpretation
grammatically, logically, etc.,and (iv)thepower ofpublic exposition.

"Now goback," saidtheMaster totheman,"and say'TheMaster sends for
himwhose name isLittle Wayman.'"
Butwhen themanwent and delivered hismessage, athousand mouths
answered, "IamLittleWayman !1amLittleWayman!"
Backcame themanwith thereport, "They allsaythey are'Little Wayman,'
reverend sir."
"Well nowgoback," saidtheMaster, "and takebythehand the firstoneof
themwhosaysheisLittleWayman. [119]andtheothers will allvanish." The
man didashewasbidden, andstraightway thethousand Brethren vanished from
sight. TheElder came backwith theman.
When themealwas over, theMaster said, "Jivaka, take Little Wayman's
bowl ;hewillreturn thanks." Jivaka did so.Then likeayoung lionroaring
defiance, theElder ranged thewhole ofthesacred texts through inhisaddress
ofthanks. Lastly, theMaster rosefrom hisseatandattended bytheOrder
returned tothemonastery, and there, after theassignment oftasks bythe
Brotherhood, herosefrom hisseatand,standing inthedoorway ofhisperfumed
chamber, delivered aBuddha-discourse totheBrotherhood. Ending with a
theme which hegave outformeditation, anddismissing theBrotherhood, he
retired into hisperfumed chamber, andlaydown lion-like onhisright side to
rest.
Ateven, theorange-robed Brethren assembled together from allsides inthe
Hall ofTruth andsang theMaster's praises, even asthough theywerespreading
acurtain oforange clothround himasthey sat.
"Brethren," itwas said, "Great Wayman failed torecognise thebent of
LittleWayman, andexpelled himfrom themonastery asadullard whocould
noteven learn asingle stanza infourwhole months. ButtheAll-Knowing
Buddha byhissupremacy intheTruth bestowed onhimArahatship with allits
supernatural knowledge, even while asingle mealwas inprogress. Andbythat
knowledge hegrasped thewhole ofthesacred texts. Oh !howgreat isaBuddha's
power!"
Now theBlessed One,knowing fullwellthetalkthatwasgoing oninthe
Hall ofTruth, thought itmeet togothere. So,rising from hisBuddha-couch,
hedonned histwoorange under-cloths, girded himself aswith lightning, arrayed
himself inhisorange-coloured robe, theample robe ofaBuddha, andcame forth
totheHall ofTruth with theinfinite grace ofaBuddha, moving with theroyal
gait ofanelephant intheplenitude ofhisvigour. Ascending theglorious
Buddha- throne setinthemidst oftheresplendent hall,heseated himself upon
themiddle ofthethrone emitting those six-coloiired rayswhich mark aBuddha,—likethenewly-arisen sun,when from thepeaks oftheYugandhara Mountains
heillumines thedepths oftheocean. Immediately theAll-Knowing Onecame
intotheHall, theBrotherhood broke oflTtheir talkandwere silent. Gazing
round onthecompany with gentle loving-kindness, theMaster thought within
himself, "This company isperfect! Notaman isguilty ofmoving hand orfoot
improperly;notasound, notacough orsneeze istobeheard !Intheir
reverence andawe ofthemajesty andglory oftheBuddha, notamanwould
dare tospeak before Idid,even ifIsathere insilence allmy lifelong. But itis
raypart tobegin ;and Iwillopen theconversation." Then inhissweet divine
tones headdressed theBrethren and said, [120]"What, pray, isthetheme of
thisconclave? Andwhatwasthetalkwhich wasbroken off?"
"Sir," said they, "itwasnoprofitless theme, butyourown praises thatwe
were telling here inconclave."
Andwhen theyhadtoldhimword forwordwhat theyhadbeen saying, the
Master said, "Brethren, through meLittleWayman hasjustnow risen togi-eat
things intheFaith ;intimes past itwas togreat things inthewayofwealth
thatherose,—Viutequally through me."
TheBrethren asked theMaster toexplain this ;andtheBlessed Onemade
clear inthese words athing which succeeding existences hadhidden from
them:—


No. 4. 19
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares inKasi,
theBodhisatta wasborn intotheTreasurer's family, andgrowing up,was
made Treasurer, being called Treasurer Little.Awiseandclever man
was he,with akeen eyeforsignsandomens. Onedayonhisway towait
upon theking, hecame onadeadmouse lying ontheroad;and,taking
note oftheposition ofthestars atthatmoment, hesaid,"Any decent
young fellow with hiswitsabout himhasonly topickthatmouse up,and
hemight start abusiness andkeep awife."
Hiswords were overheard byayoung man ofgood family butreduced
circumstances, who said tohimself, "That's amanwhohasalways gota
reason forwhat hesays." And accordingly hepicked upthemouse,
which hesold forafarthing atatavern fortheir cat.
With thefarthing hegotmolasses andtookdrinking water inawater-
pot.Coming onflower-gatherers returning from theforest, hegave each
atinyquantity ofthemolasses andladled thewater outtothem. Each of
them gavehimahandful offlowers, with theproceeds ofwhich, next day,
hecame back again totheflower grounds provided withmore molasses
andapotofwater. Thatdaytheflower-gatherers, before they went, gave
him flowering plants with halftheflowers leftonthem;andthus ina
little while heobtained eight pennies.
Later, onerainy andwindy day, thewind blewdown aquantity of
rotten branches andboughs andleaves intheking's pleasaunce, andthe
gardener didnotseeliow toclearthem away. [121] Then upcame the
young manwith anoflfer toremove the lot, ifthewood andleaves might
behis.Thegardener closed with theofieronthespot. Then thisapt
pupil ofTreasurer Little repaired tothechildren's playground and ina
very little while hadgotthem bybribes ofmolasses tocollect every stick
and leafintheplace intoaheap attheentrance tothepleasaunce. Just
then theking's potter wasonthelook outforfuel tofirebowls forthe
palace, andcoming onthisheap, took thelotoffhishands. The sale of
hiswood brought insixteen pennies tothispupil ofTreasurer Little, as
well asfivebowls andother vessels. Having nowtwenty-four pennies in
all,aplanoccurred tohim.Hewent tothevicinity oftliecity-gate with
ajarfullofwater andsupplied 500mowers with water todrink. Said
they,"You've done usagood turn, friend. What canwedoforyouT'
"Oh, I'll tellyouwhen Iwant your aid," saidhe;andashewent about,
hestruck upanintimacy with aland-trader andasea-trader. Said the
former tohim,"To-morrow there willcome totown ahorse-dealer with
500horses tosell." Onhearing thispiece ofnews, hesaid tothemowers,
"Iwant each ofyouto-day togivemeabundle ofgrass andnottosell
yourown grass tillmine issold." "Certainly," said they,anddelivered
the500bundles ofgrass athishouse. Unable togetgrass forhishorses
elsewhere, thedealer purchased ourfriend's grass forathousand pieces.

Only afewdays later hissea-trading friend brought himnews ofthe
arrival ofalarge ship inport; andanother plan struck him.Hehired
foreight pence awellappointed carriage which plied forhirebythehour,
andwent ingreat styledown totheport. Having bought theshipon
credit anddeposited hissignet-ring assecui'ity, hehadapavilion pitched
hardbyandsaid tohispeople ashetook hisseatinside,"When merchants
arebeing shewn in,letthem bepassed onbytln-ee successive ushers into
mypresence." [122] Hearing that ashiphadarrived inport, about a
hundred merchants camedown tobuythecargo; only tobetoldthatthey
could nothave itasagreat merchant hadalready made apayment on
account. Soaway they allwent totheyoung man;andthefootmen duly
announced thembythree successive ushei-s, ashadbeen arranged before-
hand. Eachman ofthehundred severally gavehimathousand ])ieces
tobuyashare inthe shij)andthen afurther thousand each t(jl)uyhimout
altogether. Soitwaswith 200,000 pieces that thispupil ofTreasurer
Little returned toBenares.
Actuated byadesire toshew hisgratitude, hewent withonehundred
thousand pieces tocallonTreasurer Little. "How didyoucome byall
thiswealth?" asked the Treasui-er. "In four short months, simply by
following your advice," replied theyoungman;andhetoldhimthewhole
story, starting with thedead mouse. Thought LordHigh Treasurer Little,
onhearing allthis, "Imust seethatayoung fellow ofthese parts doesnot
fallintoanybody else's hands." Sohemarried himtohisowngrown-up
daughter and settled allthefamily estates ontheyoung man. And at
theTreasurer's death, hebecame Treasurer inthat city. And the
Bodhisatta passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
[123] Hislesson ended, theSupreme Buddha, theAll-Knowing Onehim-
self,repeated thisstanza :—
With humblest startand trifling capitalAshrewd andableman will risetowealth.
E'en ashisbreath cannurse atiny flame.
Also theBlessed One said, "It isthrough me.Brethren, that Little
Wayman hasjustnow risen togreat things intheFaith, asintimes past to
great things inthewayofwealth." Hislesson thus finished, theIMaster made
theconnexion between thetwo stories hehadtoldand identified theBirth in
these concluding words, "Little Wayman wasinthose days thepupil ofTreasurer
Little, and Imyself LordHigh Treasurer Little."

whilst atJetavana, about theElder Udayi, called theDullard.
Atthattime thereverend Dabba, theMallian, wasmanciple totheBrother-
hood ^When intheearly morning Dabba was allotting thechecks forrice,
sometimes itwaschoice riceandsometimes itwasaninferior qucxlity which fell
totheshare oftheElder Udayi. Ondayswhen hereceived theinferior quality,
heused tomake acommotion inthecheck-room, bydemanding, "IsDabba the
onlyonewhoknows how togiveoutchecks 1Don't weknow ?"Onedaywhen
hewasmaking acommotion, theyhanded himthecheck-basket, saying, "Here!
yougivethechecks outyourself to-day I"Thenceforth, itwasUdayi whogave
outthechecks totheBrotherhood. But, inhisdistribution, hecould nottellthe
bestfrom theinferior rice; nordidheknow what seniority^ wasentitled tothe
best riceandwhat totheinferior. Sotoo,when hewasmaking outtheroster,
hehadnotanidea oftheseniority oftheBrethren thereon. Consequently, when
theBrethi-en tookuptheir places, hemade amark ontheground oronthewall
toshew thatonedetachment stood here, andanother there. Next daythere
were fewer Brethren ofonegrade andmore ofanother inthecheck-room ;where
there were fewer, themarkwastoolowdown;where thenumber wasgreater, it
wastoohigh up.ButUdilyi, quite ignorant ofdetachments, gaveoutthechecks
simply according tohisoldmarks.
Hence, theBrethren said tohim,"Friend Udayi, themark istoohighup
ortoolowdown;thebest i-ice isforthose ofsuchandsuch seniority, andthe
inferior quality forsuchandsuch others." Butheputthem back with the
argument, "Ifthismark iswhere itis,what areyoustanding here for ?Whyam
Itotrustyou ?It'smymark Itrust."
Then, theboysandnovices [124] thrust himfrom thecheck-room, crying,
"Friend Udayi theDullard, when you give outthechecks, theBrethren are
docked ofwhat theyought toget;you're not fittogivethem out;getyougone
from here." Hereupon, agreat uproar arose inthecheck-room.
Hearing thenoise, theMaster asked theElder Ananda, saying, "Ananda,
there isagreat uproar inthecheck-room. What isthenoise about?"
TheElder explained italltotheBuddha. "Ananda," said he,"this isnot
theonlytimewhen Udilyi byhisstupidity hasrobbed others oftheir profit ;he
didjustthesame thing inbygone times too."
TheElder asked theBlessed One foranexplanation, andtheBlessed One
made clearwhathadbeen concealed byre-birth.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta was i*eigning inBenares inKasi. In
those days ourBodhisatta was hisvaluer. Heused tovahie horses,

Butthekingwasgreedy andhisgreed suggested tohim thisthought:
"This vahier witli hisstyle ofvaluing willsoonexhaust alltheriches in
njyhouse; Imust getanother valuer." Opening hiswindow andlooking
outinto hiscourtyard, heespied walking across astupid, greedy hind in
whom hesawalikely candidate forthepost. Sotheking hadtheman
sent for,andasked himwhether hecould dothework. "Oh yes," said
theman ;and so,tosafeguard theroyal treasure, thisstupid fellow was
appointed valuer. After thisthefool, invaluing elephants andhorses and
thelike,used tofixaprice dictated byhisown fancy, neglecting their
trueworth ;but, ashewas valuer, theprice waswhat hesaidandno
other.
Atthattime tliere arrived from thenorth country^ ahorse-dealer with
500horses. Thekingsent forhisnewvaluer andbadehimvalue thehorses.
And theprice hesetonthewhole 500horses was justonemeasure of
rice,which heordered tobepaid over tothedealer, directing thehorses
tobeledofftothestable [125]. Away went thehorse-dealer totheold
valuer, towhom hetoldwhat hadhappened, andasked what was tobe
done. "Give himabribe," saidtheex-valuer, "and putthispoint tohim:
'Knowing aswedothatourhorses areworth just asingle measure of
rice,wearecurious tolearn fromyouwhat theprecise value ofameasure
ofrice is;could you state itsvalue intheking's presence VIfhesays
hecan,thentakehimbefore theking; and Itoowillbethere."
Readily following theBodhisatta's advice, thehorse-dealer bribed the
manandputthequestion tohim. The other, having expressed hisability
tovalue ameasure ofrice,waspromptly taken tothepalace, whither also
went theBodhisatta andmany other ministers. With dueobeisance the
horse-dealer said, "8ire, Idonotdispute itthattheprice of500horses is
asingle measure ofrice ;butIwould askyour majesty toquestion your
valuer astothevalue ofthatmeasure ofrice." Ignorant ofwhat had
passed, theking said tothefellow, "Valuer, what are500horses worth?"
"Ameasure ofrice, sire," wasthereply. "Very good,myfriend;if500
horses then areworth onemeasure ofrice,what isthatmeasure ofrice
worth?" "It isworth allBenares and itssuburbs," was the fool's
reply.
(Thus welearn that, having first valued thehorses atameasure of
hill-paddy toplease theking, hewasbribed bythehorse-dealer toestimate
thatmeasure ofI'iceattheworth ofallBenares and itssuburbs. And
thatthough thewalls ofBenares were twelve leagues round bythemselves,
while thecityandsuburbs together were three hundred leagues round !

andwhen theDakshinapatha wasfamiliar.

[126JHereupon theministers clapped theirhands andlaughed merrily.
"We used tothink," they said inscorn, "that theearth andtherealm
were beyond price ;butnowwelearn that thekingdom ofBenares
together with itsking isonlyworth asingle measure ofrice !What
talents thevaluer has !How hasheretained hispost solong? Buttruly

Then theBodhisatta repeated thisstanza':
Dost askhowmuch apeck ofrice isworth I—Why, allBenares, both within and out.
Yet, strange totell, fivehundred horses too
Areworth precisely thissame peck ofrice!
Thus puttoopen shame, theking sentthefoolpacking, andgave the
Bodhisatta the office again. Andwhen his life closed, theBodhisatta
passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended andthetwo stories told, theMaster made theconnexion
linking both together, andidentified theBirth bysaying inconclusion, —"Udayi

Onedaywhen hehadtaken outhiscloths andbedding andhadspread
them out todryinhischamber, anumber ofBrethren from thecomitry,
whowereonapilgrimage frommonastery tomonasteryi,came intheirjourneying
tohiscellandfound allthese belongings.
"Whose arethese?" they asked. "Mine, sirs," hereplied. "What, sir?"
they cried ;"thisupper-cloth and that aswell ;thisunder-cloth aswell as

inhiswants, youforsooth haveamassed allthisstock ofrequisites. Come !
wemust takeyou before theLord ofAVisdom." And, sosaying, theywent
offwithhim totheMaster.
Becoming aware oftheir presence, theMaster said, [127]"Wherefore isit,
Brethren, thatyouhave brought theBrother against hiswill?" "Sir, this
Brother iswell-oft' andhasquite astock ofrequisites." "Is ittrue, Brother, as
they say,thatyouaresowell-oft'?" "Yes, Blessed One." "But why, Brother,
haveyouamassed these belongings ?Donot 1extol thevirtues ofwanting

Angered bytheMaster's words, hecried,—"Then I'llgoabout likethis!"
And, flinging off"hisouter clothing, hestood intheir midst clad only inhis
waist-cloth.
Then, asamoral support tohim, theMaster said, "Was itnotyou.Brother,

evenwhen youwere awater-demon lived fortwelve years seeking after that
shamefacedness ?How thencomes itthat, aftervowing tofollow theweighty

Atthe]\Iaster's word, hissense ofshame wasrestored;hedonned hisrobes
again, and,saluting theMaster, seated himself attheside.
TheBrethren having asked theBlessed One toexplain tothem thematter he
hadmentioned, theBlessed Onemade clearwhathadbeen concealed fromthem
byre-birth.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta wasreigning inBenares inKasi. The
Bodhisatta, having come tobirth inthose days astheking's sonbythe
queen, wasdulynamed Prince Maliimsasa. Bythetime hecould run
about, asecond sonwasborn totheking, andthename theygave this
child was Prince Moon ;butbythetime hecould run about, the
Bodhisatta's mother died. Then thekingtookanother queen, whowashis
joyanddelight; and their lovewascrowned with thebirth ofyetanother
prince, whom theynamed Prince Sun. Inhisjoyatthebirth oftheboy,
theking promised togrant heranyboon shemight askonthechild's

"Nay," saidtheking; "two sonshave I,radiant asflaming fii'es ;I

bythis refusal, thequeen kept plaguing liimtime after time, togrant her

thecourtyard ?Andnosooner didhelearn whatwasthematter than he
made uphismind togowith hisbrothers. Sohetoowent offintheir

The three came totheregion oftheHimalayas ;andhere the
Bodhisatta, whohadturned asidefrom theroadandwassitting atthefoot
ofatree, said toPrince Sun,"Run down tothepool yonder. Sundear;
diink andbathe there;andthen bring ustoosome water back inalotus-
leaf."
(Now that poolhadbeen delivered OA'er toacertain water-sprite by
Vessavana\ whosaid tohim,"With theexception ofsuch asknow what is
truly god-like, allthatgodown into thispool areyours todevour. Over
those thatdonotenter thewaters, youhavenopower granted toyou."
And thenceforth thewater-sprite used toask ailwhowentdown intothe
poolwhatwastruly godlike, devouring everyone whodidnotknow.)
Now itwas into this pool that Prince Sunwent down, quite un-
suspiciously, with theresult thathewas seized bythewater-sprite, who
said tohim,"Doyouknow what istruly godlikel" "Oyes," saidhe;
"thesunandmoon." "You dont know," saidthemonster, andhauling
theprince down intothedepths ofthewater, imprisoned himthere inhis
ownabode. Finding that hisbrother wasalongtime gone, theBodhisatta
sent Prince Moon. Hetoowas seized bythe water-s2)rite andasked
whether heknew what wastruly godlike. "Oh yes, Iknow," saidhe;
"the four quarters ofheaven are." "Vou don't know," said thewater-
sprite ashehauled thissecond victim offtothesame prison-house.
Finding that thissecond brother tootarried long, theBodhisatta felt
sure thatsomething hadhappened tothem. Soaway hewent afterthem
andtracked their footsteps down intothewater. [129] Realising atonce

thatthepoolmust bethedomain ofawater-sprite, hegirded onhissword,
andtook hisbow inhishand, andwaited. Nowwhen thedemon found
that theBodhisatta hadnointention ofentering thewater, heassumed the
shape ofaforester, andinthisguise addressed theBodhisatta thus :"You're
tired withyour journey, mate ;why don't yougoinandhave abathe and
adrink, anddeck yourself with lotuses 1Youwould travel oncomfortably
afterwards." Recognising him atonce forademon, theBodhisatta said,
"It isyouwhohave seizedmybrothers." "Yes, itwas," wasthereply.
"Why?""Because allwhogodown into thispoolbelong tome.""What,
all?" "Not thosewhoknow what istruly godlike;allsave these are
mine." "And doyouwant toknow thegodlike?" "Ido." "Ifthisbe
so,Iwill tellyouwhat istruly godlike." "Doso,andIwill listen."
"Ishould liketobegin," saidtheBodhisatta, "butIamtravel -stained
withmyjourney." Then thewater-sprite bathed theBodhisatta, and
gave him food toeatandwater todrink, decked himwith flowers,
sprinkled himwith scents, and laidoutacouch forhiminthemidst ofa
gorgeous pavilion. Seating himself onthiscouch, andmaking thewater-
sprite sitathisfeet,theBodhisatta said, "Listen thenandyoushallhear
what thetruly godlike is."Andherepeated thisstanza:—
Those only 'godlike' callwhoshrink from sin.
Thewhite-souled tranquil votaries ofGood.
[132]Andwhen thedemon heard this,hewaspleased, andsaidtothe
Bodhisatta, "Man ofwisdom, Iampleased with you,andgiveyouupone
ofyour brothers. Which shall Ibring?" "The youngest." "Man of
wisdom, though youknow sowellwhat thetruly godlike is,youdon't act
onyour knowledge." "How so?""Why, youtake theyounger in
preference totheelder, without regard tohisseniority." "Demon, Inot
onlyknow butpractise thegodlike. Itwasonthis boy's account thatwe
sought refuge intheforest ;itwas forhim that hismother asked the
kingdom from our father, andour father, refusing tofulfil herdemand,
consented toourflight totherefuge oftheforest. With uscame thisboy,

"Excellent! excellent! Oman ofwisdom," cried thedemon inapproval;
"you notonlyknow butpractise thegodlike." [133]And intoken ofhis
pleasure andapproval hebrought forth the tivobrothers andgavethem
both totheBodhisatta.
Then saidthelatter tothewater-sprite, "Friend, itisinconsequence
ofyourown evildeeds intimes past thatyouhavenowbeen born a

will forever baryoufrom escaping re-birth inhelland theother
evil states. Wherefore, from thistime forth renounce eviland live
virtuously."
Having worked thedemon's conversion, theBodhisatta continued to
dwell atthatspotunder hisprotection, until onedayheread inthe star.i
that hisfather was dead. Then taking thewater-sprite with him, he
returned toBenares andtook possession ofthekingdom, making Prince
Moon hisviceroy andPrince Sun hisgeneralissimo. Forthewater-sprite
hemade ahome inapleasant spotandtookmeasures toensure hisbeing

"Vou7' sonam /."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about thestory ofVasabha-Khattiya, which will befound intheTwelfth

Mahanama Sakka byaslave-girl named Nagamunda, andthat sheafterwards

buttheking,coming toknow ofherservile origin, degraded herfrom herrank,

bylivehundred Brethren [134], and, sitting down ontheseatprepared for

Then theking toldhimwhathadhappened.
"Sire, whose daughter isVasabha-Khattiya?" "Mahanama's daughter, sir."

Theking asked theBlessed One toexplain this. TheBlessed Onemade
clearwhathadbeen concealed fromhimbyre-birth.
Onceonatime inBenares Brahmadatta theking,having gone ingreat
state tohisjdeasaunce, wasroaming about looking forfruits andflowers
when hecame onawoman whowasmerrily singing away asshepicked
upsticks inthegrove. Falling inlove atfirst sight, thekingbecame
intimate with her,andtheBodhisatta wasconceived then and there.
Feeling asheavy within asthough weighed down with thebolt ofIndra,
thewoman knew that shewould become amothei", and toldtheking so.
Hegave herthesignet-ring from hisfinger anddismissed herwith
these words:—"If itbeagirl,spend thisringonhernurture;but ifit
beaboy,bring ringandchild tome."
When thewoman's timewascome, shebore theBodhisatta. And
when hecould runabout andwas playing intheplayground, acry
would arise, "No-father hashitme!" Hearing tliis, theBodhisatta ran
away tohismother andaskedwho hisfather was.
"You arethesonoftheKing ofBenares, myboy." "What proof
ofthis isthere, mother?" "My son, theking onleaving megaveme
this signet-ring and said,'Ifitbeagirl,spend thisringonhernurture;
but ifitbeaboy, bring ringand child tome.'""Why then don't
youtakemetomyfather, mother?"
[135] Seeing that theboy'smind wasmade up,shetookhim tothe
gate ofthepalace, andbade their coming beannounced totheking.
Being summoned in,sheentered andbowing before hismajesty said,
"This isyour son, sire."
Thekingknew wellenough that thiswasthetruth, butshame before
allhiscourtmadehim reply, "He isnosonofmine." "Buthere isyour
signet-ring, sire;you willrecognise that." "Nor isthismysignet-ring."
Then said thewoman, "Sire, Ihavenownowitness toprovemywords,
except toappeal totruth. Wherefore, ifyoubethefather ofmychild,
Ipray that hemay stay inmid-air ;but ifnot,mayhefalltoearth

threw himupintothe air.
^Theword muhuttikdya means, Hterally, "momentary," orperhaps maybetrans-

which hecompares with thefamiliar Gandharva form, i.e. (legal) union bymutual

Once onatime inMithila intherealm ofVidelia there was a
kingnamed Makhadeva, whowasrighteous andruled righteously. For
successive periods ofeighty-four thousand yeai's hehad respectively
amused himself asprince, ruled asviceroy, audreigned asking. All
these long years hadhelived, when onedayhesaid tohisbarber,—
"Tell me, friend barber, when you seeanygrey hairs inmyhead."
Sooneday,years andyears after, [138] thebarber did findamong the
raven locks oftheking asingle grey hair, andhetold theking so.
"Pull itout,myfriend," saidtheking; "and lay itinmypalm." The
barber accordingly plucked thehairoutwith hisgolden tongs, andlaid it
intheking's hand. Thekinghadatthattime stilleighty-four thousand
years more tolive;butnevertheless atthesight ofthatonegrey hair
hewas filled with deep emotion. Heseemed toseetheKing ofDeath
standing overhim, ortobecooped within ablazing hutofleaves. "Foolish
Makhadeva!"hecried;"grey hairs have come upon you before you
have been able toridyourself ofdepravities." And ashethought
andthought about theappearance ofhisgrey hair, hegrew aflame within;
thesweat rolled down from hisbody ;whilst hisraiment oppressed him
andseemed intolei-able. "This very day," thought he,"will Irenounce
theworld fortheBrother's life."
Tohisbarber hegave thegrant ofavillage, which yielded ahundred
thousand jneces ofmoney. Hesent forhiseldest sonandsaid tohim,
"My son,grey hairs arecome upon me,and Iambecome old. Ihave
hadmy fillofhuman joys, and fainwould taste thejoys divine;the
time formyrenunciation hascome. Take thesovereignty upon yourself
;
asforme,Iwilltake u]imyabode inthepleasaunce called Makhadeva's
Mango-grove, andthere tread theascetic's path."
Ashewasthusbentonleading theBrother's life,hisministers drew
nearand said, "What isthereason, sire,whyyouadopt theBrother's
life]"
Taking thegrey hair inhishand, theking repeated thisstanza tohis
ministers:—
Lo,these grey hairs thatonmyhead appear
AreDeath's ownmessengers thatcome torob
My life. 'Tistime Tturned from worldly things.
And inthehermit's path sought saving peace.
[139jAnd after these words, herenounced hissovereignty that self-.same
dayandbecame arecluse. Dwelling inthat very Mango-grove of
Makhadeva, hethere during eighty-four thousand years fostered the
Four Perfect States within himself, and, dying with insight fulland
unbroken, wasreborn intheRealm ofBrahma. Passing thence, he
became aking again inMithila, under thename ofNimi, and after
uniting hisscattered family, oncemore became ahermit inthatsame

more totheRealm ofBrahma.
After repeating hisstatement thathehad similarly renounced theworld
inbygone days, theMaster attheendofhislesson preached theFour Truths.
Some entered theFirst Path,some theSecond, andsome theThird. Having
told thetwo stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion between them and

SUKHAVIHARI- JATAKA.
[140]"Theman whogvwds not."—This story was toldbytheMaster
while intheAnupiya Mango-grove near thetown ofAnupiya, about theElder
Bhaddiya (theHappy), who joined theBrothei-hood inthecompany ofthe
sixyoung nobles withwhom was Upali^. Ofthese theElders Bhaddiya, Kimbila,
Bhagu, andUpali attained toArahatship;theElderAnanda entered theFirst
Path;theElder Anuruddha gained all-seeing vision;andDevadatta obtained
thepower ofecstatic self-abstraction. Thestory ofthesixyoung nobles, upto
theevents atAnupiya, willberelated intheKhandahala-jataka^.
The venerable Bhaddiya, whoused inthedays ofhisroyalty toguard
himself asthough hewere appointed hisown tutelary deity, bethought him

lifehasbeenhappy ;his lifewasnolesshappy inbygone days."
TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this. The Blessed One
made clearwhathadbeen concealed fromthem byre-birth.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn awealthy northern brahmin. Realising theevilof
lusts andtheblessings that flowfrom renouncing theworld, heabjured
lusts, and retiring totheHimalayas there became ahermit andwon
theeight Endowments. Hisfollowing waxed great, amounting tofive
hundred ascetics. Oncewhen therains setin,hequitted theHimalayas
and travelling along onanalms-pilgrimage with hisattendant ascetics
through village andtown came atlast toBenares, where hetookup
hisabode intheroyal pleasaunce asthepensioner oftheking's bounty.
After dwelling here forthefour rainy months, hecame totheking
totake hisleave. Buttheking said tohim,"You areold,reverend sir.
Wherefore should yougoback tot]ieHimalayas 1Sendyour pupils back
thither [141] andstophere yourself."
The Bodhisatta entrusted his fivehundred ascetics tothecare of
hisoldest disciple, saying, "Goyouwith these totheHimalayas ;I
willstoponhere."
Now that oldest disciple hadonce been aking, buthadgiven up
amighty kingdom tobecome aBrother; bythedueperformance ofthe
rites appertaining toconcentrated thought hehadmastered theeight
Endowments. Ashedwelt with theascetics intheHimalayas, onedaya
longing came upon him toseethemaster, andhesaid tohisfellows,
"Live oncontentedly here ;Iwillcome back assoon asIhave paid
myrespects tothemaster." Soaway hewent tothemaster, paid his
respects tohim,andgreeted himlovingly. Then helaydown bytheside
ofhismaster onamatwhich hespread there.
Atthispoint appeared theking,whohadcome tothepleasaunce
toseetheascetic ;andwith asalutation hetook hisseatonone side.
Butthough hewasaware oftheking's presence, that oldest disciple
forbore torise,but still laythere, crying with passionate earnestness,
"Oh,happiness !Oh,happiness!"
Displeased that theascetic, though hehadseen him,hadnot risen,
theking said totheBodhisatta, "Reverend sir,thisascetic musthavehad
his filltoeat,seeing thathecontinues toliethere sohappily, exclaiming
with such earnestness."
"Sire," said theBodhisatta, "ofoldthis ascetic wasaking asyou
are.He isthinking how intheolddayswhen hewasalayman and

lived inregalpomp withmany aman-at-arms toguard him, henever
knew such happiness asnow ishis. Itisthehappiness oftheBrother's
life,and thehappiness that Insight brings, which move him tothis
heartfelt utterance." And theBodhisatta further repeated thisstanza
toteach theking theTruth :—
Themanwhoguards not,nor isguarded, sire,
Lives happy, freed from slavery tolusts.
[142] Appeased bythelesson thus taught him, thekingmade hissalu-
tation andreturned tohispalace. The disci])le alsotook hisleave ofhis
master andreturned totheHimalayas. ButtheBodhisatta continued to
dwell onthere, and,dying with Insight fullandunbroken, wasre-born in
theRealm ofBrahma.

heaps, dwell under treesandnever under aroof, never eatfishorflesh." These five
points were allmore rigid intheir asceticism than theBuddha's rule, andwere

riper knowledge. Gothither with anumber ofBrethren, preach theTruth to

They went thither, preached theTruth, enlightened them respecting the
Paths andtheFruits, andnextday[143] atdawn came back again with those
Brethren totheBamboo-grove. And whilst Sariputta wasstanding there after
saluting theBlessed Oneonhisreturn, theBrethren spoke thus tohim inpraise
oftheElder Sariputta, "Sir, verybright wastheglory ofourelder brother, the
Captain oftheTruth, ashereturned with afollowing offi\'ehundred Brethren;
whereas Devadatta haslost allhisfollowing."
"This isnottheonly time. Brethren, when glory hasbeen Sariputta's onhis
return with afollowing ofhiskinsfolk;likeglorywas histooinbygone days.
Sotoothis isnottheonlytimewhen Devadatta haslosthisfollowing;helost

TheBrethren asked theBlessed One toexplain thistothem. TheBlessed
Onemade clearwhathadbeen concealed byre-birth.
Once onatime inthecity ofRajagaha inthekingdom ofMagadlia
there ruled acertain king ofMagadha, inwhose days theBodhisatta came
tolifeasastag. Growing up,hedwelt intheforest astheleader ofa
herd ofathousand deer.Hehadtwoyoung onesnamed Luckie and
Blackie. When hegrew old,hehanded hischarge over tohistwo sons,
placing fivehundred deerunder thecare ofeach ofthem. And sonow
thesetwoyoung stagswere incharge oftheherd.
Towards harvest-time inMagadha, when thecrops stand thick inthe
fields, itisdangerous forthedeer intheforests round. Anxious tokillthe
creatures thatdevour their crops, thepeasants digpitfalls, fixstakes, set
stone- traps, andplant snares andother gins ;sothatmany deer areslain.
Accordingly, when theBodhisatta marked that itwas crop-time, he
sent forhistwosonsandsaid tothem, "Mychildren, itisnowthetime
when crops stand thick inthe fields, andmany deermeet their death at
this season. Wewhoareoldwillmake shift tostay inonespot ;butyou
will retire eachwithyourherd tothemountainous tracts intheforest and
come backwhen thecrops have been carried." "Very good," said his
twosons,anddeparted with their herds, astheir father bade.
Now themenwho livealong theroute, know quite wellthetimes at
which deer take tothehillsandreturn thence. And [144] lying inwait

"What, mydear 1Ours isaverywealthy family, andyouareouronly

Having failed towinherparents' consent, though sheasked them again anei

family, Iwillgainmyhusband's consent andtakethevows." Andwhen, being
grown up,sheentered another family, sheproved adevoted wifeand lived alife
ofgoodness andvirtue^inhernewhome. Now itcame topass that shecon-
ceived, though sheknew itnot.
There wasafestival proclaimed inthat city, [146] andeverybody kept
holiday, thecitybeing decked likeacity ofthegods. But she,even atthe
height ofthefestival, neither anointed herself norputonany finery, going about
inherevery-day attire. Soherhusband said toher,"My dear wife,everybody

"Mylordandmaster," shereplied, "thebody isfilled with two-and-thirty

"Icannot tell,ladies;Ionlyknow Ihave ledavirtuous life."
SotheSisters brought herbefore Devadatta, saying, "Lord, thisyoung gentle-
woman, whowasadmitted aSister with thereluctant consent ofherhusband,
hasnowproved tobewith child;butwhether this dates from before hei-

Notbeing aBuddha, andnothaving any charity, love orpity, Devadatta
thought thus:—"Itwillbeadamaging report togetabroad thatoneofmy

must expel thiswoman from theOrder." Without anyenquiry, starting forward

Thought theMaster, "Albeit thechildwasconceived while shewas still of

totheElder Upali, "Go,and clearupthismatter oftheyoung Sister inthe

"Itshall bedone, reverend sir,"saidtheElder, andforth totheassembly he

disciple insight oftheking,andplaced theconduct oftheenquiry inherhands,
saying, "First ascertain theprecise dayoftheprecise month onwhich this girl
joined theOrder, Visakha;andthence compute whether sheconceived before

ipsoventre puellaj, theladyfound, oncomparing thedaysandmonths, thatthe
conception hadtaken place before the girlhadbecome aSister. This she
reported totheElder, who proclaimed the Sister innocent before allthe
assembly. And she,nowthat herinnocence wasestablished, reverently saluted
theOrder andtheMaster, andwith theSisters returned toherownnunnery.
When hertimewascome, shebore thesonstrong inspirit, forwhom she
hadprayed atthefeetoftheBuddha Padumuttara ages ago.One day,when
thekingwaspassing bythenunnery, heheard thecryofaninfant aiidasked
hiscourtiers what itmeant. They, knowing thefacts, told hismajesty thatthe
crycame from thechild towhich theyoung Sister hadgiven birth. "Sirs,"

"Brethren, the first ineloquence among my disciples isPrince Kassapa."
Afterwards, byvirtue oftheVammika Sutta^, hewonArahatship. Sotoohis

"This isnotthe first time, Brethren," said lie,"that theTathagata lias
proved thesalvation andrefuge ofthese two :hewasthesame tothem inthe
past also."
Then, ontheBrethren asking him toexplain this tothem, herevealed what
re-birth hadhidden fromthem.
Onceonatime,when Brahmadatta wasreigning iuBenares, theBodhi-
sattawasborn adeer. Athisbirth hewasgolden ofhue ;hiseyeswere
likeround jewels;thesheen ofhisliorns wasasofsilver ;hismouth was
redasabunch ofscarlet cloth;hisfourhoofs were asthough lacquered;
histailwas liketheyak's ;andhewasasbigasayoung foal. Attended
byfivehundred deer,hedwelt intheforest under thename ofKingBanyan
Deer.Andhardbyhimdwelt another deer alsowdthanattendant herd of
livehundred deei*,whowasnamed Branch Deer, andwasasgolden ofhue
astheBodhisatta.
Inthose days theking ofBenares waspassionately fond ofhunting
andalways hadmeat atevery meal. Every dayhemustered thewhole of
hissubjects, townsfolk andcountryfolk alike, tothedetriment oftheir
business, andwent hunting. Thought hispeople, "Thisking ofours stops
allourwork. Suppose wewere [150] tosowfoodandsupply water for
thedeer inhisownpleasaunce, and,having driven inanumber ofdeer, to
barthem inanddeliver them over totheking!"Sotheysowed inthe
pleasaunce grass forthedeer toeatandsupplied water forthem to
drink, andopened thegate wide. Then they called outthetownsfolk and
setoutintotheforest armed with sticks and allmanner ofweapons tofind
thedeer. They surrounded about aleague offorest inorder tocatch
thedeer within their circle, andinsodoing sun-ounded thehaunt ofthe
Banyan andBranch deer. Assoon asthey perceived thedeer, they pro-
ceeded tobeat the trees, bushes andground with their sticks tillthey
drove theherds outoftheir lairs; thenthey rattled their swords andspears
andbows with sogreat adinthat they drove allthedeer into the
pleasaunce, andshut thegate. Then theywent tothekingand said,
"Sire,youputastop toourwork byalways going a-hunting ;sowehave
driven deerenough from theforest tofillyour pleasaunce. Henceforth
feedontJiem."
Hereupon theking betook himself tothepleasaunce, and inlooking
over theherd sawamong them twogolden deer, towhom hegranted
immunity. Sometimes hewould goofhisownaccord andshoot adeer to
bringhome ;sometimes hiscookwould goandshoot one.At first sight
ofthebow, thedeerwould dash offtrembling fortheir lives, butafter
receiving twoorthreewounds theygrew weary and faint andwere slain.
Theherd ofdeer told thistotheBodhisatta, whosent forBranch and said,
"Friend, thedeer arebeing destroyed ingreatnumbers;and,though they

Begone !"Finding nofavour with him,thedoewentontotheBodhisatta
andtoldhimher story. And heanswered, "Very well; yougoaway,
andIwillseethattheturn passes over you." And therewithal hewent
himself totheplace ofexecution andlaydown with hisheadontheblock.
Cried thecookonseeing him,"Why hei'e's theking ofthedeerwhowas
granted immunity !What does thismean1"And offherantotellthe
king. Themoment heheard of it,thekingmounted hischariot and
arrived with a-large following. "My friend theking ofthedeer," hesaid
onbeholding theBodhisatta, "did Inotpromise youyour life^How

"Sire, there came tomeadoebigwithyoung, whoprayed metolet

your majesty."
"Mylordthegolden king ofthedeer," saidtheking, "never yetsaw
I,evenamong men, one soabounding incharity, loveandpity asyou.
Thei-efore amIpleased with you. Arise !Ispare thelives both ofyou
andofher."
"Though twobespared, what shall therest do, king ofmenV"I

Great Being arose, established theking intheFiveCommandments,
saying, "Walk inrighteousness, great king. Walk inrighteousness
andjustice towards parents, children, townsmen, andcountryfolk, sothat
when thisearthly body isdissolved, youmay enter the bliss ofheaven."
Thus, with thegrace andcharm thatmarks aBuddha, didheteach the
Truth totheking.Afewdayshetarried inthepleasaunce fortheking's
instruction, andthen with hisattendant herd hepassed into the forest
again.
And that doebrought forth afawn fair astheopening bud ofthe
lotus, who Tised toplay about with theBranch deer. Seeing this his
mother saidtohim,"My child, don't goabout with him, onlygoabout
with theherd oftheBanyan deer." And byway ofexhortation, she
repeated thisstanza:—
Keep only with theBanyan deer, andshun
TheBranch deer's herd; more welcome far
Isdeath,mychild, inBanyan's company.
Than e'entheamplest term oflifewith Branch.
Thenceforth, thedeer,now intheenjoyment ofimmunity, used toeat
men's crops, andthemen, remembering theimmunity granted tothem,
didnotdare tohitthedeer ordrive them away. Sotheyassembled in
theking's courtyard and laidthematter before theking. Said he,"When
theBanyan deerwonmyfavoui-, [153] Ipromised himaboon. Iwill
forego mykingdom rather thanmypromise. Begone 1Notaman inmy
kingdom mayharm thedeer."
Butwhen thiscame tothe eai's oftheBanyan deer, hecalled hisherd
together and said, "Henceforth you shall noteatthecrops ofothers."
Andhaving thus forbidden them, hesentamessage tothemen, saying,
"From thisdayforward, letnohusbandman fence his field, butmerely
indicate itwith leaves tiedupround it."And so,wehear, began a])lan
oftying upleaves toindicate thefields; andnever wasadeerknown to
trespass onafield somarked. Forthus theyhadbeen instructed bythe
Bodhisatta.
Thus didtheBodhisatta exhort thedeer ofhisherd, andthus didhe
act allhislifelong,andattheclose ofalong lifepassed away withthem
tofareaccording tohisdeserts. Theking tooabode bytlieBodhisatta's

^''Cursed hethedart oflove."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana about thetemptation caused toBrethren bythewives oftheirmundane
life. This willberelated intheIndriya-jatakai intheEighth Book. Said the
Blessed OnetotheBrother, "Brother, itwasbecause ofthisverywoman that in
bygone daysyoumetyour death andwere roasted overglowing embers." The
Brethren asked theBlessed One toexplain this. TheBlessed Onemade clear
whathadbeen concealed fromthembyre-birth.

VVlieu theyknew that itwasthetime forthedeer tocomedown from
the hills, theMagadha folkposted themselves inambush bytheroad ;and
ahunter waslying inwait justbytheroad along which thepairwere
travelling. Scenting aman, theyoung doesuspected thatahunter wasin
ambush, and letthestaggoonfirst, following herself atsome distance.
With asingle arrow thehunter laidthestag low,andthedoeseeing him
struck was offlikethewind. Then thathunter came forth from his
hiding-place andskinned thestagand lighting afirecooked thesweet
flesh over theembers. Having eaten anddrunk, hetook offhome the
remainder ofthebleeding carcass onhiscarry ing-i)ole toregale hischildren.
Now inthose days theBodhisatta wasafaiiy dwelling inthatvery
grove oftrees, andhemarked what hadcome topass. "'Twas notfather
ormother, butpassion alone that destroyed this foolish deer [1.55]. The
dawn ofjtassion isbliss, but itsend issorrow andsuffering,—thepainful
loss ofhands, andthemisery ofthefiveforms ofbonds andblows. To
cause another's death isaccounted infamy inthisworld ;infamous too is
thelandwhich owns awoman's swayandrule ;andinfamous arethemen
who yield themselves towomen's dominion." And therewithal, while the
other fairies ofthewood applauded andoffered perfumes andfiowers and
thelikeinhomage, theBodhisatta wove thethree infamies intoasingle
stanza, andmade thewood re-echo with hissweet tones ashetaught the
truth inthese lines:—
Cursed bethedart oflovethatworks men pain I
Cursed bethelandwhere women rulesupreme!
And cursed thefoolthatbows towoman's sway!
Thus inasingle stanza were thethree infamies comprised bythe
Bodhisatta, andthewoods re-echoed ashetaught theTruth with allthe
mastery andgrace ofaBuddha [156].
Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theFour Truths, attheclosewhereof
thelove-sick Brother wasestablished intheFruit oftheFirst Path. Having
toldthetwo stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion linking thetwotogether,
andidentified theBirth.
(Henceforward, weshall omit thewords 'Having told thetwo stories,'

"Inthose days," saidtheMaster, "the love-sick Brother wasthemountain-

"There! snothing xcorse." This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about theElder Tissa, called Direct-alms theLess. Tradition says that, while the
Master wasdwelling attheBamboo-grove nearRajagaha, thescion ofawealthy
house, Prince Tissa byname, coming oneday totheBamboo-grove andthere
hearing adiscourse from theMaster, wished tojointheBrotherhood, but,being
refused because hisparents would notgive their consent, obtained their consent
byfollowing Eattha-pjila's ^example andrefusing food forseven days,and finally
took thevows with theMaster.
About afortnight afteradmitting thisyoung man, theMaster repaired from
theBamboo-grove toJetavana, where theyoung nobleman undertook theThirteen
Obligations^andpassed histime ingoing hisround foralms from house to
house, omitting none. Under thename oftheElder Tissa Direct-alms the
Less, hebecame asbright andshining alight inBuddhism asthemoon in
thevault ofheaven.
Afestival having been proclaimed atthistime atRajagaha, theElder's
mother andfather laid inasilver casket thetrinkets heused towear asa
layman, andtook ittoheart, bewailing thus,—"Atother festivals oursonused
towear this orthatbravery ashekept thefestival ;and he,ouronly son,
hasbeen taken away bythesageGotama tothetown ofSavatthi. Where
isoursonsitting noworstanding?" Now aslave-girl whocame tothehouse,
noticed thelady ofthehouse weeping, andasked herwhyshewasweeping ;and
thelady toldher all.
"What, madam, wasyour sonfond of?""Ofsuch andsuch athing,"
replied thelady. "Well, ifyou willgivemeauthority inthishouse, I'llfetch
your sonback." "Very good," said thelady inassent, andgave the girlher
expenses anddespatched herwith alarge following, saying, "Go,andmanage to
fetchmysonback."
Soaway the girlrode inapalanquin toSavatthi, where shetookupher
residence inthe street which theElder used tofrequent foralms. [157]
Surrounding herself with servants ofherown,andnever allowing theElder
toseehisfather's people about, shewatched themoment when theElder
entered thestreet andatoncebestowed onhimanalms ofvictual anddrink.
Andwhen shehadbound him inthebonds ofthecraving oftaste, shegot

aninner chamber.
Intheduecourse ofhisround foralms attheproper time, theEldercame to

When hehadseated himself, hesaid,"Where isthelay-sister?" "She's

AllthisWAH noised abroad. Sitting intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren
discussed thematter, saying, "Sirs, itisreported thataslave-girl hasbound

"Brethren," said he,"this isnotthe firsttime that, inbondage tothe
craving oftaste, hehasfollen intoherpower ;inbygone days toohefellintoher
power inlikemanner." -i\.nd sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares hehada
gardener named Safijaya. Now there came intotheking's pleasaunce a
Wind-antelope, which fledaway atthesight ofSafijaya, butthelatter let
itgowithout terrifying thetimid creature. After several visits the
antelope used toroam about inthepleasaunce. Now thegardener was
inthehabit ofgathering flowers andfruits andtaking them daybydayto
theking. Said tlieking tohimoneday, "Have younoticed anything
strange, friend gardener, inthepleasaunce 1""Only, sir,that aWind-
antelope hascome about thegrounds." "Could you catch it,doyou
think 1""Oh,yes ;ifIhadalittle honey, I'dbring itright intoyour
majesty's palace.''
Theking ordered thehoney tobegiven tothemanandhewent oflT
with ittothepleasaunce, where hefirstanointed with thehoney thegrass
attliespots frequented bytheantelope, [158] andthen hidhimself.
When theantelope came andtasted thehonied grass itwassosnared by
thelustoftaste that itwould gonowhere elsebutonly tothepleasaunce.
Marking thesuccess ofhissnare, thegardener began gradually toshow
himself. Theappearance ofthemanmade theantelope take toflight for
the firstday ortwo, butgrowing familiar with thesight ofhim, it
gathered confidence andgradually came toeatgrass from theman's hand.

"Inallthree postures."—This story was toldbytheMaster while dwelling
intheBadarika Monastery inKosambi, about theElder Raliula whose heart
wassetonobserving therules oftheBrotherhood.
Oncewhen theMaster wasdwelling intheAggalava Temple hardbythe
town ofAjavl, many female lay-disciples and Sisters used toflock thither
tohear theTruth preached. Thepreaching w^as inthedaytime, l)utastime

wore on,thewomen didnotattend, andthere were onlyBrethren andmen
disciples present. Then thepreaching took place intheevening ;and at
theclose theElder Brethren retired each tohisownchamber. Buttheyounger
ones with thelay-disciples laydown torest intheService-hall. When they
fellasleep, loudwasthesnoring andsnorting andgnashing ofteeth asthey
lay. [161] After ashort slumber some gotup,andreported totheBlessed
Onetheimpropriety which theyhadwitnessed. Said he,"IfaBrother sleeps
inthecompany ofNovices, itisaPacittiya offence (requiring confession and
absolution)." And after delivering thisprecejjt hewentaway toKosambi.
Thereon theBrethren saidtotheReverend Bahula, "Sir, theBlessed Onehas
laiddown thisprecept, andnowyouwillplease findquarters ofyourown." Now,
before this,theBrethren, outofrespect forthefather andbecause oftheanxious
desire ofthesontoobserve therules oftheBrotherhood, hadwelcomed theyouth
asiftheplace were his;—theyhad fitted upalittle bedforhim,andhadgiven
himacloth tomake apillow with. Butonthedayofourstory theywould not
even givehimhouse-room, sofearful were they oftransgressing. The excellent
Rahula went neither totheBuddha asbeing hisfather, nortoSariputta, Captain
oftheFaith, asbeing hispreceptor, nortotheGreat Moggallana asbeing his
teacher, nortotheElderAnanda asbeing hisuncle;butbetook himself tothe
Buddha's jakes andtookuphisabode there asthough inaheavenly mansion.
Now inaBuddha's jakes thedoor isalways closely shut :thelevelled floor isof
perfumed earth ;flowers andgarlands arefestooned round thewalls;and all
night longalamp burns there. But itwasnotthissplendour which prompted
Rahula totakeuphisresidence here. Nay, itwassimply because theBrethren
hadtoldhim tofindquarters forhimself, andbecause hereverenced instruction
andyearned toobserve therules oftheOrder. Indeed, from time totime the
Brethren, totesthim,when theysawhimcoming from quite adistance, used to
throw down ahand-broom oralittle dust-sweepings, andthen askwhohad
thrown itdown, afterRahula hadcome in."Well, Rahula came thatway,"
would bethei-emark, butnever didthefuture Elder sayheknew nothing about
it.Onthecontrary, heused toremove thelitterandhumbly askpardon ofthe
Brother, norgoaway tillhewasassured thathewaspardoned; —soanxious was
hetoobserve therules. And itwassolely thisanxiety which madehimtakeup
hisdwelling inthejakes.
Now, though dayhadnotyetdawned, theMaster halted atthedoor of
thejakes andcoughed 'Ahem.' 'Ahem,' responded theReverend Rahula. "Who
isthere?" saidtheBuddha. "It isI,Rahula," wasthereply; andoutcame
theyoungmanandbowed low. "Whyhaveyoubeen sleeping here,Rahula?"
"Because Ihadnowhere togoto.Up tillnow, sir,theBrethren have been
verykind tome ;butsuch istheir present fearoferring [162] thattheywon't
givemeshelter anymore. Consequently, Itookupmyabode here, because
Ithought itaspotwhere Ishould notcome intocontact withanybody else."
Then thought theMaster tohimself, "Ifthey treat evenRahula like this,
what willthey notdotoother youths whom theyadmit totheOrderl" And
hisheart wasmoved within him fortheTruth. So,atanearly hourhehadthe
Brethren assembled, andquestioned theCaptain oftheFaith thus, "Isuppose
youatallevents, Sariputta, know where Rahula isnowquartered?'
"No, sir,Idonot."
"Sariputta, Rahula wasliving thisdayinthejakes. Sariputta, ifyoutreat
Rahula like this,what willnotbeyour treatment ofother youths whom you
admit totheOrder? Such treatment willnotretain thosewho join us.In
future, keep your Novices inyourown quarters foradayortwo,andonly
onthethird day letthem lodge out,taking care toacquaint yourself with their
lodging." With this rider, theMaster laiddown theprecept.
Gathering together intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren spoke ofthegoodness
ofRahula. "See, sirs,howanxious wasRahula toobserve therules. When
told tofind hisown lodging, hedidnotsay, 'IamthesonoftheBuddha;
what haveyoutodowith quarters ?Yoioturn out!
'No ;notasingle Brother
didheoust,butquartered himself inthejakes."

Astheywere talking thus, theMaster came totheHallandtook hisseaton
histhrone ofstate, saying, "What isthesubject ofyour talk,Brethren?"
"Sir," wasthe reply, "wewere talking oftheanxiety ofRahula tokeep
therules, nothing else."
Then said theMaster, "This anxiety Rahula hasshewn notonly now,
butalso inthepast,when hehadbeenbornananimal." And sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime acertain king ofMagadha wasreigning inRajagaha;
andinthose days theBodhisatta, liaving been born astag,wasliving in
theforest atthehead ofaherd ofdeer.Now hissister brought herson
tohim, saying, "Brother, teach yournephew here theruses ofdeer."
"Certainly," saidtheBodhisatta; "goaway now,myboy,andcome back
atsuchandsuch atime tobetaught." Punctually atthetime hisuncle
mentioned, theyoung stagwasthere andreceived instruction intheruses
ofdeer.
Onedayashewasranging thewoods hewascaught inasnare and
littered theplaintive cryofacaptive. Away fledtheherdandtoldthe
mother ofherson's capture. Shecame toherbrother andasked him
whether hisnephew hadbeen taught theruses ofdeer. "Fear not; [163]
your son isnotatfault," saidtheBodhisatta. "Hehaslearnt thoroughly
deer's ruses, and willcome back straightway toyour great rejoicing."
And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Inallthree postures—onhisback orsides—
Your son isversed ;he'strained touseeight hoofs*,
And save atmidnight never slakes histhirst;
Asheliescouched onearth, helifeless seems.
And only with hisunder-nostril breathes.
Sixtricks 2mynephew knows tocheat hisfoes.
[1G4] Thus didtheBodhisatta console hissister byshewing herhow
thoroughly hersonhadmastered theruses ofdeer. Meantime theyoung
stagonbeing caught inthesnare didnotstruggle, butlaydown atfull
length^ onhisside,with hislegsstretched outtautand rigid. Hepawed

"Sir, atwhat time doeswhat iscalled coldappear?" "Itappears inthe liglit

about Feasts fortheDead. For atthistime thefolkwere jiutting todeath
goats, sheep, andother animals, and offering themupaswhat iscalled aFeast
fortheDead, forthesake oftheir departed kinsmen. Finding them thus
engaged, theBrethren asked theMaster, saying, "Just now, sir,thefolk are
taking thelives ofmany living creatures and oftering themupaswhat iscalled
aFeast fortheDead. Can itbe,sir,thatthere isanygood inthis?"
"No,Brethren," replied theMaster ;"notevenwhen lifeistaken with the

consequences ofthepractice, made thewhole continent renounce it.Butnow,

hassprung upafresh." And, sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, abrahmin,

minded tooffer aFeast fortheDead, hadagoat fetched andsaid tohis

hang agarland round itsneck, give itapottle ofgrain toeat,groom ita
bit,andbring itback."
"Very good," said they, anddown totheriver they took thegoat,
where they bathed andgroomed thecreature and set itonthebank.
Thegoat,becoming conscious ofthedeeds ofitspast lives, wasoverjoyed
atthethought thatonthisveryday itwould befreed from allitsmisery,
andlaughed aloud likethesmashing ofapot.Then atthethought that
thebrahmin byslaying itwould bear themisery which ithadborne, the
goat feltagreat compassion forthebrahmin, andwept with aloud voice.
"Friend goat," saidtheyoung brahmins [167], "your voice hasbeen loud
both inlaughter and inweeping ;whatmade youlaugh andwhatmade
youweep 1"
"Askmeyour question before your master."
Sowith thegoattheycame totheir master andtoldhim ofthematter.
After hearing their story, themaster asked thegoatwhy itlaughed and
why itwept. Hereupon theanimal, recalling itspastdeeds byitspower
ofremembering itsformer existences, spoke thus tothebrahmin:—"In
times past,brahmin, I,likeyou,wasabrahmin versed inthemystic texts
oftheVedas, and I,tooffer aFeast fortheDead, killed agoat formy
offering. Allthrough killing that single goat, Ihavehadmyhead cutoff
fivehundred times allbutone. This ismyfivehundredth and lastbirth;
and Ilaughed aloud when Ithought that thisverydayIshould befreed
frommymisery. Ontheother hand, Iweptwhen Ithought how, whilst
T,who forkilling agoathadbeendoomed tolosemyhead fivehundred
times, was to-day being freed frommymisery, you, asapenalty for
killing me,would bedoomed toloseyour head, likeme, fivehundred
times. Thus itwasoutofcompassion foryouthat Iwept." "Fear not,
goat," saidthebrahmin ;"Iwillnot killyou." "What isthisyou say,
brahmin?"saidthegoat. "Whether you killmeornot, Icannot escape
death to-day." "Fear not,goat; Iwillgoabout withyoutoguard you."
"Weak isyour protection, brahmin, and strong istheforce ofmy
evil-doing."
Setting thegoat atliberty, thebrahmin saidtohisdisciples, "Letus
notallow anyone tokillthisgoat;" and,accompanied bytheyoung men,
hefollowed theanimal closely about. Themoment thegoatwas setfree,
itreached out itsneck tobrowse ontheleaves ofabushgrowing near
thetopofarock. And thatvery instant athunderbolt struck therock,

whom heshielded from harm. Thus didhecounsel hissiibjects :—"My
friends, inthis forest there aretrees thatarepoisonous andlakes thatare
haunted byogres. Mind toaskme first before you either eatany fruit
which youhave noteaten before, ordrink ofanywater where youhave
notdrunk before." "Certainly," saidthey readily.
Onedaytheycame toaspottheyhadnever visited before. Asthey
were searching forwater todrink after their day's wanderings, theycame
onthis lake. Butthey didnotdrink;onthecontrary they satdown
watching forthecoming oftheBodhisatta.
When hecame up,hesaid, "Well,myfriends, why don'tyoudrink 1"
"Wewaited foryoutocome."
"Quite right,myfriends/' saidtheBodhisatta. Then hemade acir-
cuit ofthelake,andscrutinized thefootprints round, with theresult that
hefound that allthefootsteps leddown intothewater andnonecame up
again. "Without doubt," thought hetohimself, "this isthehaunt ofan
ogre." Sohesaid tohisfollowers, "You arequite right,myfriends, in
notdrinking ofthis vi^ater ;forthelake ishaunted byanogre."
When thewater-ogre realised thattheywere notentering hisdomain,
[171] heassumed theshape ofahorrible monster with ablue belly, a
white face,andbright- redhands andfeet ;inthisshape hecame outfrom
thewater, and said,"Why areyouseated here'?Godown into thelake
anddrink." ButtheBodhisatta said tohim, "Arenotyoutheogre of
thiswater 1""Yes, Iam,"wastheanswer. "Doyoutake asyourprey
allthosewhogodown into thiswater?" "Yes, Ido;from small birds
upwards, Inever letanything gowhich comes down intomywater. I
willeatthelotofyou too." "Butweshall not letyoueatus," "Just
drink thewater." "Yes,wewilldrink thewater, andyetnot fallinto

shall notenter thewater atall,butthewhole eighty thousand ofuswill
take acaneeachanddrink therewith fromyour lake aseasily aswecould

halfbeing added bytheMaster when, asBuddha, herecalled the inci-
dent) :—
Ifound thefootprints allleaddown, none back.
With canes we'll drink;you shall nottakemy life.
8osaying, theBodhisatta hadacanebrought tohim. Then, calling to
mind theTenPerfections displayed byhim, herecited them inasolemn
asseveration', andblewdown thecane. [172] Straightway thecanebecame

fashion hehadanother andanother brought andblewdown them. (But
ifthiswere so,hecould never have finished;andaccordingly theforego-
ingsentence must notbeunderstood inthis—literal—sense.) Next the
Bodhisatta made thetour ofthelake,andcommanded, saying, "Let all
canes growing herebecome hollow throughout." Now, thanks tothe
great virtues ofthesaving goodness ofBodhisattas, theircommands are
always fulfilled. And thenceforth every single cane thatgrew round tliat
lakebecame hollow throughout.
(InthisKaj)jm, orEra,there arefour miracles which endure through
thewhole Era.What arethefourl Well, they are—first, thesign ofthe
hare inthemoon', which will lastthrough thewhole Era;secondly, the
spotwhere the firewasputoutastold intheVattaka Jataka*, which

ofGhatikara's house^ norain shall ever fallwhile thisEra lasts;and
lastly, thecanes thatgrow round thislake shall behollow throughout
during thewhole oftheEra. Such arethefour Era-mii-acles, asthey are
called.)
After giving thiscommand, theBodhisatta seated himself withacane in
hishands. Alltheother eighty thousand monkeys tooseated themselves
round thelake, eachwith acane inhishands. And atthesamemoment
when theBodhisatta sucked thewater upthrough hiscane, they alldrank

drank, andnotoneofthem could thewater-ogre get ;sohewent off'ina
rage tohisown habitation. TheBodhisatta, too,with hisfollowing went
back intotheforest.
When theMaster hadended hislesson andhadrei)eated what hehadsaidas

[173]"Theantelope knoics well"— This storywastoldbytheMaster while at
theBamboo-gi-ove about Devadatta. Foroncewhen theBrethren weregathered
together intheHall ofTruth, they sattalking reproachfully ofDevadatta, saying,
"Sirs,with aview todestroy theBuddha Devadatta hiredbowmen, hurled down
arock,and letloose theelephant Dhana-palaka;ineverywayhegoesabout to
slaytheLord of^^'isdoml." Entering andseating himself ontheseatprepared
forhim, theMaster asked, saying, "Sirs, what isthetheme youarediscussing
here inconclave?" "Sir," wasthereply, "wewere discussing thewickedness of
Devadatta, saying that hewasalways going about toslay you." Said the
Master, "It isnotonly inthese present days, Bretliren, thatDevadatta goes
about seeking toslayme ;hewent about with thelikeintent inbygone days
also,— butwasunable toslayme."And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasanantelope, andused toliveonfruits inhis
haunts intheforest.
Atoneperiod hewas subsisting onthe fruit ofasepamii-tree.
And there wasavillage liunter, whose method was tobuild aplatform
intrees atthefoot ofwhich hefound thetrack ofdeer, and towatch
aloft fortheircoming toeatthefruits ofthetrees. When thedeercame,
hebrought themdown with ajavelin, and soldthe flesh foraliving.
Thishunter onedaymarked thetracks oftheBodhisatta atthefoot ofthe
tree,andmade himself aplatform upintheboughs. Having breakfasted
early, hewent with hisjavelin into theforest andseated himself onhis
platform. TheBodhisatta, too,came abroad early toeatthefruit ofthat
tree ;buthewasnotintoogreat ahurry toapproach it."For," thought
hetohimself, "sometimes these platform-building hunters build themselves
platforms intheboughs. Can itbethat thiscanhave happened here 1"
Andhehalted someway offtoreconnoitre. Finding that theBodhisatta
didnotapproach, thehunter, stillseated aloftonhisplatform, [174] threw
fruitdown infront oftheantelope. Said thelatter tohimself, "Here's
thefruitcoming tomeetme; Iwonder ifthere isahunter upthere."
Sohelooked, andlooked, tillhecaught sight ofthehunter inthetree;
but, feigning nottohave seen theman, heshouted, "My worthy tree,
hitherto youhavebeen inthehabit ofletting your fruit fallstraight to

atree.And therefore, asyouhave ceased tobehave asbecomes atree, I
toomust change, andlook forfoodbeneath another tree." And sosaying,
herepeated thisstanza:—
Theantelope knows wellthefruityoudrop.
Ilike itnot;some other tree I'llseek*.
Then thehunter from hisplatform hurled hisjavelin attheBodhisatta,
crying, "Begone !I'vemissed you this time." Wheeling round, the
Bodhisatta halted and said,'•Youmayhave missed lae^mygoodman;
butdepend upon it,youhave notmissed thereward ofyour conduct,
namely, theeight Large andthesixteen Lesser hellsand alltheliveforms
ofbonds andtorture." With these words theantelope bounded offonits
way ;andthehunter, too,climbed down andwent hisway.
When theMaster hadended thisdiscourse andhadrepeated what hohad
saidabout Devadatta's going about toslayhim inbygone days also,heshewed
theconnexion andidentified theBirth, bysaying, "Devadatta wastheplatform-
hunter ofthose days,and Imyself theantelope."

they leftinthecourtyard, stillhitched ontothechariot. Inthenight
itrained andtheharness gotwet. Moreover, theking's dogscamedown
from theupper chambers andgnawed theleather work andstraps. Next
daythey toldtheking, saying, "Sire, dogshave gotinthrough themouth
ofthesewer andhavegnawed theleather work and straps ofyour
majesty's carriage." Enraged atthedogs, theking said, "Killevery dog
you see." Then began agreat slaughter ofdogs ;andthecreatures,
finding thattheywere being slainwhenever theywere seen, repaired to
thecemetery totheBodhisatta. "What isthemeaning," asked he,"ofyour
assembling insuchnumbers'?" They said,"The king issoenraged atthe
report thattheleather workand straps ofhiscarriage have beengnawed
bydogs within theroyal precincts, that hehasordered alldogs tobe
killed. Dogs arebeing destroyed wholesale, andgreat peril hasarisen."
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "No dogsfrom without canget
intoaplace soclosely watched ;itmust bethethoroughbred dogs inside
thepalace whohavedone it.Ati)resent nothing ha{)pens tothereal
culprits, while theguiltless arebeing put todeath. What ifIwere to
discover theculprits tothekingandsosave thelives ofmykithandkin?"
Hecomforted hiskinsfolk bysaying, "Have nofear ;Iwillsave you.
[176] Only waithere tillIseetheking."
Then, guided bythethoughts oflove,and calling tomind theTen
Perfections, hemade hisway alone andunattended into the city,com-
manding thus,"Let nohand belifted tothrow stick orstone atme."
Accordingly, when hemade hisappearance, notamangrew angry atthe
sight ofhim.
Theking meantime, after ordering thedogs' destruction, hadtaken
hisseatinthehallofjustice. And straight tohimrantheBodhisatta,
leaping under theking's throne. The king's servants tried togethim
out;buthismajesty stojjped them. Taking heart alittle, theBodhisatta
came forth from under thethrone, andbowing totheking, said, "Is
ityouwho arehaving thedogs destroyed?" "Yes, itisI.""What
istheir otfence, king ofmenl" "They have beengnawing thestraps
andtheleather covering mycarriage." "Do youknow thedogswho
actually didthemischief?" "No, Idonot." "But, your majesty, if
youdonotknow forcertain thereal culprits, itisnotright toorder the
destruction ofevery dogthat isseen." "Itwasbecause dogshadgnawed
theleather ofmycarriage that Iordered them alltobekilled." "Do
your people kill alldogs without exception ;orarethere some dogswho
arespared1""Some arespared,—thethorough-bred dogs ofmyown
palace." "Sire, justnowyouwere saying thatyouhadordered the
universal slaughter ofalldogswherever found, because dogshadgnawed
theleather ofyour carriage ;whereas, now,yousaythat thethorough-
breddogs ofyourownpalace escape death. Therefoi-e youarefollowing

thefour Evil Courses ofpartiality, dislike, ignorance and fear. Such
courses arewrong, andnotkinglike. Forkings intrying cases should
beasunbiassed asthebeam ofabalance. But inthis instance, since
theroyal dogsgoscot-free, whilst poor dogs arekilled, this isnotthe
impartial doom ofalldogs alike, butonly theslaughter ofpoor dogs."
Andmoreover, theGreat Being, lifting uphissweet voice, said, "Sire, it
isnotjustice thatyouareperforming," andhetaught theTruth tothe
king inthisstanza:—[177]
Tliedogs that intheroyal palace grow.
Thewell-bred dogs, sostrong and fairoffoi'm,—
Not these, butonly we,aredoomed todie.
Here's noimpartial sentence meted out
Toallalike ;'tisslaughter ofthepoor.
After listening totheBodhisatta's words, theking said, "Doyou in
yourwisdom knowwho itactually wasthatgnawed theleather ofmy
carriage]" "Yes, sire.""Who wasit?" "The thorough-bred dogs
that liveinyourown palace." "How can itbeshewn that itwasthey
whognawed theleather?" "Iwillprove ittoyou," "Do so,sage."
"Then send foryour dogs,andhave alittle butter-milk andkusa-grass
brought in."Theking did so.
Then saidtheGreat Being, "Letthisgrass bemashed upinthebutter-
milk, andmake thedogsdrink it."
Theking didso;—with theresult thateach several dog, ashedrank,
vomited. And they allbrought upbits ofleather !"Why itislikea
judgment ofaPerfect Buddha himself," cried theking overjoyed, and
hedidhomage totheBodhisatta byoflfering himtheroyal umbrella. But
theBodhisatta taught theTruth inthetenstanzas onrighteousness inthe
Te-sakuna Jataka^, beginning with thewords :—
Walk righteously, great king ofprincely race.
Then having established theking intheFiveCommandments, and
having exhorted hismajesty tobesteadfast, theBodhisatta handed back to
theking thewhite umbrella ofkingship.
Attheclose oftheGreat Being's words, [178] thekingcommanded
thatthelives ofallcreatures should besafefromharm. Heoi-dered that
alldogsfrom theBodhisatta downwards, should have aconstant supply of
foodsuch ashehimself ate; and, abiding bytheteachings oftheBodhi-
satta, hespent hislifelong incharity andother good deeds, sothatwhen
hedied hewas re-born intheDeva Heaven. The*Do^'s Teachins:'

"Though prostrate jiow."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana about aBrother who gaveuppersevering. For itwasthen that
theMaster addressed thatBrother and said, "Brethren, inbygone days thewise
andgood persevered evenamid hostile surroundings, and,evenwhen theywere
woimded, stilldidnotgive in."And, sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattacame tolifeasathoroughbred Sindh horse andwasmade theking's
destrier, surrounded byallpomp and state. Hewasfedonexquisite
three-year oldrice,which wasalways served uptohim inagolden dish
worth ahundred thousand pieces ofmoney ;andtheground ofhisstall
was[lerfumed with thefour odours. Round hisstallwerehung crimson
curtains, while overhead wasacanopy studded with stars ofgold. Onthe
walls were festooned wreaths andgarlands offragrant flowers; andalamp
fedwith scented oilwasalways burning thez'e.
Now allthekings round coveted thekingdom ofBenares. Once seven
kings encompassed Benares, andsentamissive totheking, saying, "Either
yield upyourkingdom tousorgive battle." Assembling hisministers,
theking ofBenares laidthematter before them, andasked them what he
wastodo. Said they, "Youought nottogoouttodobattle inperson,
sire, inthe first instance. [179] Despatch suchandsuch aknight out first
tofightthem;andlater on,ifhefails,wewilldecide what todo."
Then theking sent forthatknight andsaid tohim,"Can youfight the
seven kings,mydearknight? "Said he,"Give mebutyour noble destrier,
andthen Icould fight notseven kings only, but allthekings inIndia."
"Mydear knight, takemydestrier oranyother horse youplease, anddo
battle." "Very good,mysovereign lord," saidtheknight; andwith abow
hepassed down from theupper chambers ofthepalace. Then hehadthe
noble destrier ledoutandsheathed inmail,arming himself toocnp-a-yiie.

andgirding onhissword. Mounted onhisnoble steed hepassed outofthe
city-gate, andwith alightning charge broke down the firstcamp, taking
oneking alive andbringing himback aprisoner tothesoldiers' custody.
Returning tothe field, hebroke down thesecond andthethird camps,
and soonuntil hecaptured alive five kings. The sixthcamp hehad
justbroken down, andhadcaptured thesixth king,when hisdestrier
received awound, which streamed with blood andcaused thenoble animal
sharp pain. Perceiving thatthehorse waswounded, theknight made it
liedown attheking's gate, loosened itsmail,and setabout arming another
horse. AstheBodhisatta layatfulllength onhisside,heopened hiseyes,
andgathered what theknight was doing. "My rider," thought heto
himself, "isarming another horse. That other horse willnever beable to
break down theseventh camp andcapture theseventh king ;hewilllose
allthat Ihave accomplished. This peerless knight willbeslain;andthe
king, too,will fallintothehands ofthefoe. Ialone, andnoother horse,
canbreakdown thatseventh camp andcapture theseventh king." So,as
helaythere, hecalled totheknight, and said, "Sir knight, there isno
horse butIwhocanbreak down theseventh camp and capture the
seventh king. Iwillnotthrow away what Ihave already done;only
havemesetuponmyfeetandcladagain inmyarmour." And sosaying,
herepeated thisstanza:—[180]
Though prostrate now,andpierced with darts, Ilie,
Yet stillnohack canmatch thedestrier.

Theknight hadtheBodhisatta setupon his feet,bound uphiswound,
andarmed himagain inproof. Mounted onthedestrier, hebroke down
theseventh camp, andbrought back alive theseventh king,whom he
handed over tothecustody ofthesoldiers. They ledtheBodhisatta too
uptotheking's gate, andthekingcame out tolookupon him. Then
said theGreat Being totheking, "Great king, slaynotthese seven
kings ;bindthembyanoath,and letthem go.Lettheknight enjoy all
thehonour due tousboth, for itisnotright that awarrior who has
presented you with seven captive kings should bebrought low.And
asforyourself, exercise cliarity, keep theCommandments, and ruleyour

exhorted theking, theytook offhismail;butwhen theywere taking it
offpiecemeal, hepassed away.

"Change thou thespot."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about anex-goldsmith, whohadbecome aBrother andwasco-resident withthe
Captain oftheFaith (Sariputta).
Now, itisonly aBuddha whohasknowledge ofthehearts andcanread
thethoughts ofmen; andtherefore through lack ofthispower, theCaptain
oftheFaith hadsolittleknowledge oftheheart andthoughts ofhisco-resident,
astoprescribe impurity asthetheme formeditation. This wasnogood
tothat Brother. Thereason why itwasnogood tohimwas that, according
totradition, hehadinvariably been born, throughout fivehundred successive
births, asagoldsmith; and, consequently, thecumulative effect ofseeing
absolutely pure gold forsolongatimehadmade thetheme ofimpurity useless.
Hespent fourmonths without being able togetsomuch asthe first inkling
ofthe idea. Finding himself unable toconfer Arahatship onhisco-resident,
theCaptain oftheFaith thought tohimself, "This must certainly beonewhom
none butaBuddha canconvert ;Iwilltakehim totheBuddha." Soat
earlydawn hecame with theBrother totheMaster.
"What can itbe,Sariputta," saidtheMaster, "that hasbrought youhere
with thisBrother?" "Sir, Igavehimatheme formeditation, and after four
months hehasnotattained tosomuch asthe first inkling oftheidea; so
Ibrought himtoyou,thinking thatherewasonewhom none butaBuddha can
convert." "What meditation, Sariputta, didyou prescribe forhim?" "The
meditation onimpurity. Blessed One." "Sariputta, itisnotyours tohave
knowledge ofthehearts andtoread thethoughts ofmen. Depart now alone,
andintheevening come back tofetch your co-resident."
After thusdismissing theElder, theMaster hadthatBrother clad inanice
under-cloth andarobe, kepthim constantly athissidewhen hewent into
town foralms, andsawthathereceived choice food ofallkinds. Returning to
theMonastery oncemore, surrounded bytheBrethren, theMaster retired during
thedaytime [183] tohisperfumed chamber, andatevening, ashewalked about
theMonastery with thatBrother byhisside, hemade apond appear andinit
agreat clump oflotuses outofwhich grew agreat lotus-flower. "Sit here,
Brother," hesaid,"andgaze atthis flower." And, leaving theBrother seated
thus, heretired tohisperfumed chamber.
That Brother gazed andgazed atthat flower. The Blessed Onemade it
decay. AstheBrother looked atit,theflower initsdocay farled; thepetals

fell off,beginning attherim, tillinalittle while allwere gone; then the
stamens fellaway, andonly thepericarp was left.Ashelooked, thatBrother
thought within himself, "Even now, thislotus-flower waslovely and fair; yetits
colour isdeparted, itspetals andstamens have fallen away, andonly the
pericarp isleftstanding. Decay hasc(mieupon this beautiful lotus; whatmay
notbefallmybody? Transitory are allcompounded things!" And with the
thought hewon Insight.
Knowing thattheBrother's mind had I'isen toInsight, theblaster, seated as
hewas inhisperfumed chamber, emitted aradiant semblance ofhimself,
anduttered thisstanza:—
Pluck out self-love, aswith thehand youpluck
Theautumn water-lily. Setyour heart
Onnaught but this, theperfect Path ofPeace,
And that Extinction which theBuddha taught.
Attheclose ofthisstanza, thatBrother wonArahatship. Atthethought
thathewould never beborn again, never betroul)led with existence inany
shajje hereafter, heliurst into aheartfelt utterance beginning with these
stanzas :—
Hewhohaslived his life,whose thought isripe;
Hewho,from alldefilements purged and free.
Wears hislastbody; hewhose life ispure.
Whose subject senses ownhimsovereign lord;—
He, likethemoon thatwins herway atlast
From Rahu's jaws^, haswonsupreme release.
The foulness which enveloped me,which wrought
Delusion's utter darkness, Idispelled
;—As,tricked withthousand rays, thebeaming sun
Illumines heaven with aflood oflight.
After thisandrenewed utterances ofjoy,hewent totheBlessed Oneand
saluted him. TheElder, too,came, andafterduesalutation totheMaster, went
away with hisco-resident.
When news ofallthisspread among theBrethren, [184] they gathered
together intheHall ofTruth andthere satpraising thevirtues oftheLord
ofWisdom, andsaying, "Sirs, through notknowing thehearts andthoughts
ofmen, theElder Sariputta wasignorant ofhisco-resident's disposition. But
theMaster knew, and inasingle daybestowed onhimArahatship together
with perfected scholarship. Oh,how great arethemarvellous powers ofa
Buddha!"
Entering andtaking theseat setready forhim, theMaster asked, saying,
"What isthetheme ofyour discourse here inconclave, Brethren?"
"Naught else.Blessed One,than this,—thatyoualone hadknowledge ofthe
heart, andcould read thethoughts, oftheco-resident oftheCaptain ofthe
Faith."
"This isnomarvel. Brethren; that I,asBuddha, should nowknow that
Brother's disposition. Even inbygone days Iknew itequally well." And, so
saying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.

"Through hearing first."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta, who, having secured theadherence ofPrince
Ajata-sattu, hadattained both gainandhonour. Prince Ajata-sattu hada
Monastery built forDevadatta atGaya-sisa, andevery daybrought tohim[186]
fivehundred kettles ofperfumed three-year-old riceflavoured with allthechoicest
flavourings. Allthisgainandhonour brought Devadatta agreat following,
withwhom Devadatta lived on,without ever stirring outofhisMonastery.
Atthat time there were living inRajagaha two friends, ofwhom one
hadtaken thevows iinder theMaster, whilst theother hadtaken them under
Devadatta. And these continued toseeoneanother, either casually orby
visiting theMonasteries. Nowonedaythedisciple ofDevadatta saidtotheother,
"Sir,whydoyoudaily goround foralms with thesweat streaming oft'you?
Devadatta sitsquietly atGaya-slsa and feeds onthebest offare, flavoured
with allthechoicest flavourings. There's noway like his.Why breed misery
foryourself? Why should itnotbeagood thing foryou tocome the first
thing inthemorning totheMonastery atGaya-sisa andthere drink our rice-
gruel with arelish after it,tryoureighteen kinds ofsolid victual, andenjoy our
excellent softfood, flavoured with allthechoicest flavourings?"
Being pressed time aftertime toaccept theinvitation, theother began towant
togo,andthenceforth used togotoGaya-sTsa andthere eatand eat,notforget-
tinghowever toreturn totheBamboo-grove attheprojjer hour. Nevertheless
hecould notkeep itsecret always;and inalittle while itcame outthat
heused tohie oft'toGaya-sisa andthere regale himself with thefoodprovided
forDevadatta. Accordingly, hisfriends asked him, saying. "Isittrue, asthey
say,thatyouregale yourself onthefoodprovided forDevadatta?" "Who said
that?" said he."So-and-so said it." "It istrue, sirs,that IgotoGaya-sisa
andeatthere. But itisnotDevadatta who givesmefood ;others dothat."
"Sir, Devadatta isthefoeoftheBuddhas; inhiswickedness, hehassecured
theadherence ofAjilta-sattu andbyunrighteousness gotgainandhonour
forhimself. Yetyouwhohave taken thevows according tothis faith which
leads tosalvation, eatthefood which Devadatta getsbyunrighteousness.
Come; letusbring you before theMaster." And, taking withthem the
Brother, theywent totheHall ofTruth.
When theMaster became aware oftheir presence, hesaid, "Brethren, areyou
l)riiiging this Brother here against hiswill?" "Yes, sir; this Brother, after
taking thevows under you, eatsthefoodwhich Devadatta getsbyunrighteous-
ness." "Is ittrue, asthey say,thatyoueatthefoodwhich Devadatta getsby
unrighteousness?" "ItwasnotDevadatta, sir,thatgave itme,but others."

68 TheJ(Itaha. Booh I.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta became hisminister. Inthose days thekinghadastate-
elephant [187], named Damsel-face, whowasvirtuous andgood, andnever
hurt anybody.
Now onedaysome burglars came closeuptotheelephant's stallby
night and satdown todiscuss their plans inthese words:—"This isthe
way totunnel into ahouse;this isthewaytobreak inthrough thewalls;
befoi-e carrying offtheplunder, thetunnel orbreach inthewalls ought
tobemade asclearandopen asaroad oraford. Inlifting thegoods,
youshouldn't stick atmurder; forthus there willbenone able toresist.
Aburglar should getridofallgoodness and virtue, andbequite pitiless,
aman ofcruelty and violence." After having schooled oneanother in
these counsels, theburglars took themselves off.Thenextdaytoothey
came, andmany other days besides, andheld likeconverse together, till
theelephant came totheconclusion thattheycame expressly toinstruct
him,andthathemust turn pitiless, cruel, andviolent. Andsuchindeed
hebecame. Nosooner didhismahout appear intheearly morning than
theelephant took theman inhistrunk anddashed him todeath onthe
ground. And inthesamewayhetreated asecond, andathird, andevery
person inturnwhocame near him.
Thenewswasbrought totheking thatDamsel-face hadgonemadand
was killing everybody thathecaught sight of.Sotheking sent the
Bodhisatta, saying, "Go, sage,andfindoutwhat hasperverted him."
Away went the Bodhisatta, and soon satisfied himself that the
elephant showed nosigns ofbodily ailment. Ashethought over the
possible causes ofthechange, hecame totheconclusion thattheelephant
mu.st have heard persons talking near him,andhave imagined thatthey
were giving him alesson, and that thiswaswhat hadperverted the
animal. Accordingly, heasked theelephant-keepers whether anypersons
hadbeen talking together recently near the stallbynight. "Yes,my
lord," was theanswer ;"some burglars came and talked." Then the
Bodhisatta wentandtoldtheking, saying, "There isnothing wrong, sire,
with theelephant bodily ;hehasbeen perverted byoverhearing some
burglars talk." "Well, what istobedonenowV "Order good men,
sages andbrahmins, tositinhisstalland totalk ofgoodness." "Doso,
myfriend," saidtheking. Then theBodhisatta setgoodmen, sagesand
bi'ahmins, inthestall [188], andbadethem talk ofgoodness. And they,
taking their seats hardbytheelephant, spoke asfollows, "Neither mal-
treat nor kill. Thegood should belong-suffering, loving, andmerciful."
Hearing thistheelephant thought theymustmean this asalesson for
him,andresolved thenceforth tobecome good. Andgoodhebecame.
"Well, myfriend," .said theking totheBodhisatta; "ishegood
now?" "Yes, your majesty," saidtheBodhisatta; "thanks towiseand

And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Through hearing firsttheburglars' wicked talk
Damsel-fixce ranged abroad towound and kill;
Through hearing, later, wisemen's lofty woixls
Thenoble elephant turned good once more.
Said theking,"He canread themind even ofananimal!" Andhe
conferi-ed great honour ontheBodhisatta. After living toagood old
age, ho,with tlieBodhisatta, passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Said theMiister,—"Inthepast, too,youfollowed everyone youmet,Brother;
hearing burglars talk,youfollowed what they said;andhearing thewiseand
good talk,youfollowed what they said." Hislessou ended, heshewed thecon-
nexion, and identified theBirth, bysaying, "The traitorous Brother wasthe

"jVomorsel can heeat."—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about alay-disciple andanaged Elder. [189]
Tradition says that there were inSavatthi two friends, ofwhom onejoined
theBrotherhood butused togoe\'ery day totheother's house, where his
friend used togivehimanalms offoodandmake ameal himself, andthen
accompany himback totheMonastery, where hesattalking allthelivelong day
tillthesunwent down, when hewent back totown. And hisfriend the
Brother used toescort himonhishomeward way,going asfarasthecity-gates
before turning back.
Theintimacy ofthese twobecame known among theBrethren, whowere
sitting onedayintheHall ofTruth, talking about theintimacy which existed
between the pair,when theMaster, entering theHall, asked what wasthe
subject oftheir talk ;andtheBrethren toldhim.
"Notonlynow, Bretliren, arethese twointimate withoneanother," saidthe
Master; "they were intimate inbygone days aswell." And, sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta became hisminister. Inthose days there wasadogwhich
used togotothestall oftheelephant ofstate, andeatthegobbets ofrice
which fellwhere theelephant fed.Haunting theplace forthefood's sake,


^0 TheJdtaha. Book I.
thecloggrew very friendly with theelephant, andatlastwould never eat
except with him.And neither could getonwithout theother. Thedog
used todisport himself byswinging backwards andforwards onthe
elephant's trunk. Now onedayavillager bought thedogofthemahout
andtook thedoghome with him. Thenceforward theelephant, missing
thedog,refused either toeatordrink ortake hisbath;andthekingwas
told ofit.Hismajesty despatched theBodhisatta tofindoutwhy the
elephant behaved like this.Proceeding totheelephant-house, theBodhisatta,
seeing howsadtheelephant was, said tohimself, "He hasgotnobodily
ailment ;hemust haveformed anardent friendship, and issorrowing at
the loss ofhisfriend." Soheasked whether theelephant hadbecome
friends with anyone.
"Yes,my lord," wastheanswer; "there's averywarm friendship
between himandadog." "Where isthatdognow?" "Amantook it
off'.""Doyouhappen toknow where thatman lives?" "No,mylord."
TheBodhisatta went tothekingand said, "There isnothing thematter
with theelephant, sire; buthewasvery friendly with adog,[190] and it
ismissing hisfriend which hasmadehim refuse toeat,Iimagine." And
sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Nomorsel canheeat,noriceorgrass;
And inthebath hetakes nopleasure now.
IMethinks, thedoghad sofamiliar grown,
That elephant anddog wei'e closest friends.
"Well," said theking onhearing this;"what istobedone now,
sage?" "Let proclamation bemade bybeatofdrum, your majesty, tothe
effect thataman isreported tohave carried oflJ"adogofwhich theelephant
ofstatewasfond, andthattheman inwhose house thatdogshall befound,
shallpaysuchandsuch apenalty." Theking acted onthisadvice ;and
theman,when hecame tohear ofit,promptly letthedog loose. Away
ranthedog atonce, andmade hisway totheelephant. Theelephant
took thedogupinhistrunk, andplaced itonhishead, andwept and
cried, and, again setting thedogontheground, sawthedogeat firstand
then took hisown food.
"Even theminds ofanimals areknown tohim," saidtheking, andhe
loaded theBodhisatta with honours.
Thus theMaster ended hislesson toshew that thetwowere intimate in
bygone days aswell asatthat date. This done, heunfolded theFour Truths.
(This unfolding oftheFour Truths forms part ofalltheother Jatakas ;butwe
shall onlymention itwhere itisexpressly mentioned that itwasblessed unto
fruit.) Then heshewed theconnexion, and identified theBirth bysaying,
"The lay-disciple wasthedogofthose days, theaged Elder wastheelephant,
and Imyself thewise minister." [191]

''ISpeak onlywords ofkindness."^—This storywastoldbytheMaster while at
Jetavaiia, about thebitter words spoken bytheSix^ For, inthose days the
Six,when they disagreed with respectable Brethren, used totaunt, revile and
jeerthem, andloadthem with thetenkinds ofabuse. This theBrethren
rc[)orted totheBlessed One,whosent fortheSixandasked whether thischarge
was true. Ontheir admitting itstruth, herebuked them, saying, "Brethren,
hard woi'ds galleven animals :inbygone days ananimal made amanwhohad
used harsh language tohim loseathousand pieces." And, sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime at 'Jakkasila intlieland ofGandhara there wasakino-
reigning there, andtheBodhisatta came tolifeasabull.When hewas
quite atiny calf,hewaspresented byhisowners toabrahmin whocame
in—theybeingknown togiveaway presents ofoxen tosuch-like holymen.
Thebrahmin called itNandi-Visfda (Great- Joy),andtreated itlikehisown
child, feeding theyoung creature onrice-gruel and rice. When the
Bodhisatta gi-ew up,hethought thus tohimself, "Ihavebeenbrought up
bythisbrahmin with great pains, and allIndia cannot show thebullwhich
candrawwhat Ican.How ifIwere torepay thebrahmin thecost ofmy
nurture bymaking proof ofmystrength1"Accordingly, onedayhesaid
tothebrahmin, "Go,brahmin, tosomemerchant rich inherds, andwager
himathousand pieces thatyour bullcandraw ahundred loaded carts."
Thebrahmin went hisway toamerchant andgotintoadiscussion with
him astowhose oxen inthetown were thestrong. "Oh,so-and-so's,
orso-and-so's," saidthemerchant. "But," added he,"there arenooxen in
thetown which cancompare withmine forreal strength." Said the
brahmin, "Ihave abullwhocanpullahundred loaded carts." "Where's
such abull tobefound 1"laughed themerchant. "I've gothimathome,"
saidthebrahmin. "Make itawager." "Certainly," saidthebrahmin,
andstaked [192] athousand pieces. Then heloaded ahundred cartswith
sand, gravel, andstones, andleashed thelottogether, onebehind theother,
bycords from theaxle-tree oftheoneinfront tothetrace-bar ofits
successor. This done, hebathed Nandi-Visala, gavehim ameasure of
perfumed ricetoeat,hung agarland round hisneck, andharnessed him all

alone totheleading cart. Thebrahmin inperson took hisseatupon the
pole,andflourished hisgoad intheair,shouting, "Now then,yourascal!
pullthem along, yourascal!"
"I'm nottherascal hecallsme,"thought theBodhisatta tohimself;
andsoheplanted hisfour feet likesomany posts, andbudged notaninch.
Straightway, themerchant made thebrahmin payover thethousand
pieces. Hismoney gone, thebrahmin took hisbulloutofthecartandwent
home, where helaydown onhisbedinanagony ofgrief. When Nandi-
Visala strolled inandfound thebrahmin aprey tosuch grief, hewent up
tohimandeuquii-ed ifthebrahmiu were taking anap."How should Ibe
taking anap,when Ihavehadathousand pieceswon ofme"?""Brahmin,
allthetime Ihave lived inyour house, have Ieverbroken apot,or
squeezed upagainst anybody, ormade messes about 1""Never, mychild."
"Then, whydidyou callmearascal? It'syouwho ai'etoblame, not I.
Goandbethimtwothousand thistime. Onlyremember nottomiscall me
rascal again." When heheard this,thebrahmin went offtothemerchant,
andlaidawager oftwothousand. Just asbefore, heleashed thehundred
carts tooneanother andharnessed Naudi-Visala, very spruce and fine, to
theleading cart. Ifyouaskhowheharnessed him, well, hedid itinthis
way:—first,hefastened thecross-yoke ontothepole ;then heputthe
bull inonone side,andmade theother fastbyfastening asmooth piece
ofwood from thecross-yoke ontotheaxletree, sothat theyokewas
tautandcould notskew round either way. Thus asingle bullcoulddraw
acartmade tobedrawn bytwo. Sonowseated onthepole, thebrahmiu
stroked Nandi- Visala ontheback, andcalled onhim inthis style, "Now
then,myfinefellow !pullthem along,myfinefellow!"With asingle
pulltheBodhisatta tugged along thewhole string ofthehundred carts
[193] tillthehindermost stood where theforemost had started. The
merchant, rich inherds, paidupthetwothousand pieces hehad lostto
thebrahmin. Other folks, too,gave large sums totheBodhisatta, and
thewhole passed intothehands ofthebrahmin. Thus didhegain greatly
byreason oftheBodhisatta,
Thus laying down, byway ofrebuke totheSix, tlierulethathardwords
please noone,theMaster, asBuddha, uttered thisstanza :—
Speak onlywords ofkindness, never words
Unkind. Forhimwhospoke him fair,hemoved
Aheavy load,andbrought him wealth, forlove.
When hehadthusended hislesson astospeaking onlywords ofkindness,
theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wasthebrahmin ofthose
days,and Imyself Nandi- Visala."

After heImd i)erfornied theDouble Miracle andhadmade astay inHeaven,
theAll-knowing Buddha descended atthecity ofSaihkassa onthedayofthe
(Ireat Pavarana- Festival, andthence passed withalarge following toJetavana.
Gathering together intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren satpraising thevirtues

borne bytheBuddha. TheSixteachers, though they protested sooften that
they, andthey only,would perform miracles, yetnotasingle miracle didthey
woi'k. !how peerless istheMaster1"
Entering theHallandasking thetheme which theBivthrcn were discussing in
conclave [194], theMaster wasinformed that theirtheme wasnoother than his
own virtues. "Brethren," saidtheMaster, "who shallnowbeartheyoke borne
byme? Even inbygone days,when Icame tolifeasananimal, Iwasun-

Once unatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasabull.Andwhile hewas stillayoung calf, his
owners, whohadbeen lodging withanoldwoman, made himover toher
insettlement oftheir reckoning. She reared him likeherown child,
feeding himonrice-gruel and riceandonother good cheer. Thename
hebecame known bywas"Granny's Blackie." Growing up,heused to
range about with theother cattle ofthevillage, andwas asblack asjet.
The village urchins used tocatch hold ofhishorns andearsanddewlaps,
andhave aride ;ortheywould holdontohistailinplay,andmount on

Onedayhethought tohimself, "My mother isvery poor; shehas
painfully reared me,asifIwere herown child. What ifIwere toearn
somemoney toeaseherhard lot?" Thenceforth hewasalways looking out
forajob.Now, onedayayoung merchant atthehead ofacaravan came

And theyoung merchant, being ajudge ofcattle, ranhiseyeover the

harness him,then ;hehasgotnomaster hereabouts."
Butwhen theyoung merchant slipped acord [195] through the
Bodhisatta's noseandtried toleadhim off,thebullwould notbudge. For,
wearetold, theBodhisatta would notgotillhispaywas fixed. Under-
standing hismeaning, themerchant said, "Master, ifyou will pull these
fivehundred waggons across, Iwillpayyoutwo coins per cart, ora
thousand coins inall."
Itnow required noforce togettheBodhisatta tocome. Away he
went, andthemen harnessed him tothecarts. The firsthedragged over
with asingle pull,andlanded ithighanddry;andinlikemanner hedealt

Theyoung merchant tiedround theBodhisatta's neck abundle containing
fivehundred coins, orattherateofonly uiieforeach cart. Thouglit the
Bodhisatta tohimself, "This fellow isnotpaying meaccording tocontract!
Iwon't lethimmove on!" Sohestood across thepath oftheforemost
waggon andblocked theway.And tryasthey would, they could notget
himoutoftheway. "Isuppose heknows I'vepaidhimshort," thought
themerchant; andhewrapped upathousand coins inabundle, which he
tiedround theBodhisatta's neck, saying, "Here's yourpay forpulling the

pieces ofmoney tohis"mother,"
"What's thatround theneck ofGranny's Blackie?" cried thechildren
ofthevillage, running uptohim. ButtheBodhisatta made atthem from
afarandmadethem scamper off,sothathereached his"mother" allright.
Notbutwhat heappeared fagged out,with hiseyes bloodshot, from
dragging allthose fivehundred waggons over the river. The pious
woman, finding athousand pieces ofmoney round hisneck, cried out,
"Where didyou get this,mychild ?"Learning from theherdsmen
what hadhappened, sheexclaimed, "Have Ianywish toliveonyour

came tolifeinhispreceding birth inthehamlet ofMacala intheland
ofMagadha, even sowas itintheselfsame hamlet that theBodhisatta
came tolifeinthose days asayoung noble. When thedayforhisnaming

Inthatvillage there were justthirty families, andonedaythemenwere
standing inthemiddle ofthevillnge transacting theaffairs ofthevillage.
TheBodhisatta hadkicked aside thedustfrom where hewasstanding,
andwasstanding there incomfort, when upcame another andtook his

mandments, andthenceforth used togoabout withthem doing good works.
And they toodoing good works, always intheBodhisatta's company, used
togetupearly and sally foi'tli, with razors andaxesandclubs intheir
hands. With their clubs they used torolloutoftheway allstones that
layonthefourhighways andother roads ofthevillage ;thetrees that
woidd strike against theaxles ofchariots, they cutdown ;rough places
tliey n)ade smooth;causeways they built, dugwater-tanks, and built a
hall ;theyshewed charity andkept theCommandments. Inthiswise
didthebody ofthevillagers generally abide bytheBodhisatta's teachings
andkeep theCommandments.
Thought thevillage headman tohimself, "When thesemenused to
getdrunk andcommit murders and soforth, Iused tomake alotof
money outofthem notonlyontheprice oftheir drinks butalsobythe
finesanddues they paid. Butnow hei-e's thisyoung brahmin Magha
bentonmaking them keep theCommandments ;heisputting astop to
nmrders andother crime." [200]And inhisragehecried, "I'llmake
them keep theFiveCommandments!"And herepaired totheking,
saying, "Sire, there isaband ofrobbers going about sacking villages and
committing other villanies." When theking heard this, hebade the
headman goandbring themenbefore him.Andaway went themanand
haided upasprisoners before theking every oneofthose thirty men,
representing them tobethe i-ascals. Without enquiry into their doings,
thekingcommanded offhand thatthey should betrampled todeath by
theelephant. Forthwith theymade them liedown intheking's court-
yardandsent fortheelephant. TheBodhisatta exhorted them, saying,
"Bear inmind theCommandments ;lovetheslanderer, thekingandthe
elephant asyourselves." Andthey didso.
Then theelephant wasbrought intotrample them todeath. Yet
leadhim asthey might, hewould notapproach them, but fledaway
trumpeting loudly. Elephant after elephant wasbrought up;—butthey
allfledaway likethe first. Thinking thatthemenmust havesome di-ug
about their persons, theking ordered them tobesearched. Search was
made accordingly, butnothing wasfound;—and sothey told theking.
"Then theynmst bemuttering some spell," said theking; "askthem
whether theyhave gotaspell tomutter."
Thequestion being puttothem, theBodhisatta saidtheyhadgota
spell. And thi.stheking's people told hismajesty. Sothekinghadthem
allsummoned tohispresence and said, "Tellmeyour spell."
TheBodhisatta made answei-, "Sire, wehave noother spellthan this,

ourstrength."
Well-pleased with them, theking gavethem allthewealth inthe
slandei'er's house andmade him their slave ;andhegavethem the

Thenceforward, doing goodworks totheir hearts' content, theysent for
acarpenter andcaused him toputupalarge hall atthemeeting ofthe
fourhighways; but[201] astheyhad lost alldesire forwomankind, they
would notletanywoman share inthegoodwork.
Now inthose clays there were fourwomen intheBodhisatta's house,
whose names weie Goodness, Thoughtful, Joy, and Highborn. Of
these Goodness, finding herself alone with thecarpenter, gave him a
douceur, saying,—"Brother, contrive tomakemethe])rincipal person in
connexion with this hall."
"Very good," said he.And before doing anyother work onthe
building, hehadsome pinnacle- wood dried, which hefashioned andbored
andmade into afinished pinnacle. This hewraj^ped upinacloth and
laid aside. When thehallwas finished, and itwastime toputonthe
pinnacle, heexclaimed, "Alas,mymasters, there's onethingwehave not
made." "What's thaf?" "Why, weought tohave apinnacle." "All
right, letonebegot." "But itcan't bemade outofgreen wood; weought
tohave apinnacle which hadbeen cutsome time ago,andfashioned, and
bored, andlaidby." "Well, what istobedonenow?" "Why, have a
lookround tosee ifanybody hasgotsuch athing inhishouse asaready-
made pinnacle forsale." Asthey looked round accordingly, they found
oneinthehouse ofGoodness, butcould notbuy itofherforanymoney.
"Ifyou willmakemeapartner inthegoodwork," said she,"Iwillgive
ityoufornothing."
"No," wasthereply, "wedonotletwomen have ashare inthegood
work."
Then said thecarpenter tothem, "Mymasters, what isthisyou
say? Save theRealm ofBrahma, there isnoplace from which
women are excluded. Take the pinnacle, and ourwork will be
complete."
Consenting, theytook thepinnacle andcompleted their hall. Theyhad
benches putup,andjars ofwater setinside, providing alsoaconstant
supply ofboiled rice.Round thehallthey built awallwith agate, strew-
ingthespace inside thewallwith sandandplanting arowoffan-palms
outside. Thoughtful toocaused apleasaunce tobelaidoutatthis spot,
andnotaflowering orfruit-bearing treecould benamed which didnot
grow there. Joy, too,caused awater-tank tobedug inthesame place,
covered over with thefivekinds oflotuses, beautiful tobehold. High-
born didnothing atall.

The Bodhisatta fulfillpd these seven injunctions, —tocherish one's
mother, tocherish one's fatlier, tohonour one's elders, tospeak truth, [202]
toavoid harsh speech, toeschew shmder, andtoshun uig,2;ardliness ;—
Whoso supports hisparents, honours age,
Isgentle, friendly-spoken, slandering not,
Unchurlish, truthful, lord—notslave—ofwrath,—Him e'entheThirty Threeishall hailasGood.
Such wasthepraiseworthy state towhich liegrew, and athis life's
close hepassed away tobereborn intheRealm oftheTliirty-three as
Sakka, king ofDevas ;andthere toowere hisfriends reborn.
Inthose days there wereAsuras dwelling intheRealm oftheThirty-
three. Said Sakka, King ofDevas, "What good tousisakingdom
which others share 1"Sohemade theAsuras drink theliquor ofthe
Devas, andwhen theywere drunken, hehadthem hurled bythefeeton
tothesteeps ofMount Sineru. They tumbled rightdown to'TheAsura
Realm,' asitiscalled,—aregion onthelowest level ofMount Sineru,
equal inextent totheRealm oftheThirty-three. Here grows atree,
resembling theCoral Tree oftheDevas, which lasts foranaeon and is
called thePied Trumpet-flower. Theblossoms ofthis treeshewed them
atonce that thiswasnottheRealm ofDevas, forthere theCoral Tree
blooms. Sothey cried, "OldSakka hasmade usdrunk and castusinto
thegreat deep, .seizing onourheavenly city." "Come," theyshouted, "let
uswinback ourownrealm fromhimbyforce ofarms." Andupthe
sides ofSineru they climbed, likeantsupapillar.
Hearing thealarm given that theAsuras were up,Sakka went out
into thegreat deep togivethem battle, butbeing woisted inthefight
turned and fledaway along crest after crest ofthesouthern deep inhis
*Chariot ofVictory,' which wasahundred and fiftyleagues long.
Now ashischariot sped along thedeep, itcame totheForest ofthe
Silk-Cotton Trees. Along thetrack ofthechariot these mighty trees
weremowed down like somany palms, and fellinto thedeep. And as
theyoung oftheGarujas hurtled through thedeep, loudwere their shrieks.
SaidSakka toMatali, hischarioteer, "Matali, myfriend, whatmanner of
noi.se isthis? [203]How heartrending itsounds." "Sire, itisthe
united cryoftheyoung Garulas intheagony oftheir fear, astheir forest
isuprooted bytherush ofyour chariot." Said theGreat Being, "Let
them notbetroubled because ofme, friend Matali. Letusnot, for
1One ofthedevalokas, orangelic realms, ofBuddhist cosmogony, was the
Tavatifiisa-hhavanam, or'Eealm oftheThirty-three,' socalled because itsdenizens
were subject tothirty-three Devas headed bySakka, theIndra ofthepre-buddhist
faith. Every world-system, itmay here beadded, hadaSakka ofitsown, asis
indicated infra.

empire's sake, soactastodestroy life. Eather will I,fortheir sake, give
my lifeasasacrifice totheAsuras. Turn thecarback." And sosaying,
herepeated thisstanza:—
Let alltheforest's nestlings, Matali,
Escape ourall-devouring chariot.
IoSer up,awilling sacrifice,
My lifetoyonder Asuras;these poor birds
Shall not,through me,from outtheir nests betorn.
Attheword, Matali, thecharioteer, turned thechariot round, andmade
fortheRealm ofDevas byanother route. Butthemoment theAsuras saw
himbegin toturn hischariot round, they cried outthattheSakkas ofother
worlds were sui-ely coming up;"itmust behisreinforcements which make
himturn hischariot back again." Trembling fortheir lives, they allran
away andnever stopped tilltheycame totheAsura Realm. AndSakka
entering heaven, stood inthemidst ofhiscity, girtround byanangelic
host ofhisownandofBrahma's angels. And atthatmoment through
theriven earth there roseupthe'Palace ofVictory,' some thousand
leagues high,—so-called because itarose inthehour ofvictory. Then, to
prevent theAsviras fromcoming back again, Sakka hadguards setinfive
places,—concerning which ithasbeen said:—
[204] Impregnable both cities stand !between,
Infivefold guard, watch Nagas, Garulas,
Kumbhandas, Goblins, andtheFour Great Kings !
Butwhen Sakka wasenjoying asking ofDevas theglory ofheaven,
safely warded byhissentinels atthese five posts. Goodness diedandwas
reborn asahandmaiden ofSakka oncemore. Andtheeffect ofhergiftof
thepinnacle wasthatthere arose forheramansion^named 'Goodness'—
studded with heavenly jewels, fivehundred leagues high, where, under a
white heavenly canopy ofroyal state, satSakka, king ofDevas, ruling men
andDevas.
Thoughtful, too, died,andwasoncemore born asahandmaiden of
Sakka ;andtheeffect ofheraction inrespect ofthepleasaunce wassuch
thatthere arose apleasaunce called 'Thoughtful's Creeper-Grove.' Joy, too,
diedandwasreborn oncemore asoneofSakka's handmaidens ;andthe
fruit ofhertankwasthatthere arose atank called 'Joy'after her. But
Highborn, [205] having performed noactofmerit, wasreborn asacrane
inagrotto intheforest.
"There's nosign ofHighborn," saidSakka tohimself; "Iwonder
where shehasbeen reborn." And asheconsidered thematter, hedis-
covered herwhereabouts. Sohepaidheravisit,andbringing herback
withhimtoheaven shewed herthedelightful cityoftheDevas, theHall of
Goodness, Thoughtful's Creeper-Grove, andtheTank called Joy. "These
three," saidSakka, "have been reborn asmyhandmaidens byreason of
c.J. 6

thegoodworks they did ;butyou,having done nogood work, have been
reborn inthebrute creation. Henceforth keep theCommandments."
Andhaving exhorted herthus,andconfirmed herintheFiveCommand-
ments, hetook herback and lethergofree.And thenceforth shedid
keep theCommandments.
Ashort time afterwards, being curious toknow whether shereally was
abletokeep theCommandments, Sakka went andlaydown before herin
the shajie ofafish. Thinking the fishwasdead, thecrane seized itby
thehead. The fishwagged itstail. "Why, Idobelieve it'salive," said
thecrane, and letthe fish go."Very good, very good," saidSakka;
"you willbeable tokeep theCommandments." And sosaying hewent
away.
Dying asacrane, Highborn wasreborn intothefamily ofapotter in
Benares. Wondering where shehadgot to,andatlastdiscovering her
whereabouts, Sakka, disguised asanoldman, filled acartwithcucumbers
ofsolid goldand satinthemiddle ofthe village, crying, "Buymy
cucumbers !buymycucumbers !"Folkcame tohimandasked forthem.
"Ionly partwiththem tosuch askeep theCommandments," said he,
"doyoukeepthem?" "We don'tknow what youmean byyour'Com-
mandments'; sellusthecucumbers." "No; Idon't wantmoney for
mycucumbei'S. Igivethem away,—butonly tothose thatkeep the
Commandments." "Who isthiswag 1"said thefolk asthey turned
away. Hearing ofthis.Highborn thought toherself thatthecucumbers
musthavebeenbrought forher,andaccordingly wentandasked forsome.
"Doyoukeep theCommandments, madam ]"said he. "Yes, Ido,"was
thereply. "Itwasforyoualone that Ibrought these here," said he,and
leaving cucumbers, cartand allatherdoorhedeparted.
Continuing allher lifelong tokeep theCommandments, Highborn
after herdeath wasreborn thedaughter oftheAsura king Vepacittiya,
andforhergoodness wasrewarded with thegiftofgreat beauty. When
shegrew wp,herfather mustered theAsuras together togive hisdaughter
herpick ofthem forahusband. [206]AndSakka, whohadsearched and
found outherwhereabouts, donned theshape ofanAsura, andcamedown,
saying tohimself, "IfHighborn chooses ahusband really after herown
heart, Ishall behe."
Highboi-n wasarrayed andbrought forth totheplace ofassembly,
where shewasbidden toselect ahusband after herown heart. Looking
round andobserving Sakka, shewasmoved byherlove forhim ina
bygone existence tochoose himforherhusband. Sakka carried her oflfto
thecityofthedevas andmade herthechief oftwenty-five millions of
dancing-girls. Andwhen histerm oflifeended, hepassed away tofare
according tohisdeserts.

Hislesson ended, theMaster rebuked thatBrother inthese words, "Thus,

"While concord reigns.^' This storywastoldbytheMaster while dwelling in
theBanyan-grove near Ka[)ilavatthu, about asquabble over aporter's head-pad,
aswillberelated intheKunala-jataka^
Onthis occasion, however, theMaster spoke thus tohiskinsfolk:—"My
lords, strifeamong kinsfolk isunseemly. Yes, inbygone times, animals, who
haddefeated theirenemies when they lived inconcord, came toutter destruction
when they fellout." And attherequest ofhisroyal kinsfolk, hetold thisstory
ofthepast.
Onceupon atimewhen Brahmadatta waskingofBenares, theBodhisatta
wasborn aquail, andlived intheforest atthehead ofmany thousands of
quails. Inthose days afowler whocaught quails came tothat place ;and
heused toimitate thenoteofaquail tillhesawthat thebirds hadbeen
drawn together, when heflung hisnetoverthem, andwhipped thesides
ofthenettogether, soastogetthem allhuddled upinaheap. Then
hecrammed them into hisbasket, andgoing home sold hisprey fora
living.
Now onedaytheBodhisatta saidtothose quails, "Thisfowler ismaking
havoc among ourkinsfolk. Ihave adevice whereby hewillbeunable to
catch us. Henceforth, theverymoment hethrows thenetover you, let
eachoneputhisheadthrough amesh andthen allofyoutogether must
flyaway with thenettosuch place asyouplease, andthere letitdown on
athoi-n-brake;thisdone, wewill allescape from ourseveral meshes."
"Very good," saidthey allinready agreement.
Onthemorrow, when thenetwascastoverthem, they didjust asthe
Bodhisatta had toldthem:—they lifted upthenet,[209] and letitdown
onathorn-brake, escaping themselves from underneath. While thefowler
was still disentangling hisnet,evening came on ;andhewentaway
empty-handed. Onthemorrow andfollowing days thequails played the
same trick. Sothat itbecame theregular thing forthefowler tobe
engaged tillsunset disentangling hisnet,andthen tobetake himself home
empty-handed. Accordingly hiswifegrew angry and said, "Daybyday
youreturn empty-handed ;Isuppose you'x'e gotasecond establishment to
keepupelsewhere."

86 TheJdtaka. Book I.
"No,mydear," saidthefowler; "I've nosecond establishment tokeep

mentmynet isoverthem, offthey flywith itandescape, leaving itona
thorn-brake. Still, they won't live inunity always. Don't youbother
yourself ;assoon asthey start bickering among themselves, Ishall bag
the lot,andthat willbring asmile toyour facetosee."And sosaying, he
repeated thisstanza tohiswife :—
While concord reigns, thebirds bear offthenet.
When quarrels rise, they'll fallaprey tome.
Notlong after this,oneofthequails, inalighting ontheir feeding-
ground, trodbyaccident onanother's head. "Who trodonmyhead 1"
angrily cried this latter. "Idid;butIdidn't mean to.Don't beangry,"
saidthe first quail. Butnotwithstanding thisanswer, theother remained
asangry asbefore. Continuing toanswer oneanother, theybegan to
bandy taunts, saying, "Isuppose itisyousingle-handed who liftupthe
net," Astheywrangled thuswith oneanother, theBodhisatta thought
tohimself, "There's nosafety with onewho isquarrelsome. Thetime
hascomewhen they willnolonger liftupthenet,andthereby they will
come togreat destruction. Thefowler willgethisopportunity. Ican
stay here nolongei'." And thereupon hewith hisfollowing went
elsewhere.
Sureenough thefowler [210] came back again afewdays later, and
first collecting them together byimitating thenote ofaquail, flung his
netoverthem. Then saidonequail, "They saywhen youwere atwork
lifting thenet,thehairofyourhead fell off.Now's your time; liftaway."
Theother rejoined, "When youwere lifting thenet,they saybothyour
wings moulted. Now's yourtime ;liftaway."
Butwhilst theywere each inviting theother toliftthenet,thefowler
himself lifted thenetforthemandcrammed them inaheap into hisbasket
andborethem offhome, sothat hiswife's facewaswreathed with smiles.
"Thus, sire," said theMaster, "such athing asaquarrel among kinsfolk
isunseemly;quarrelling leads only todestruction." Hislesson ended, heshewed

"'Tis notthecold."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about being seduced bythewife ofone'smundane lifebefore joining theBrother-

"Yes,Blessed One."
"Because ofwhom?"
"Myformer wife, sir,issweet totouch ;Icannot giveherup !"Then said
theMaster, "Brother, thiswoman ishurtful toyou. Itwasthrough herthat in
bygone times tooyouwere meeting your end,when youwere saved byme."
And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattabecame hisfamily-priest.
Inthose dayssome fishermen hadcasttheir netintotheriver. Anda
great bigfishcame along amorously toying with hiswife. She, scenting
thenetassheswam ahead ofhim,made acircuit round itandescaped.
Butheramorous spouse, blinded bypassion, sailed right intothemeshes
ofthenet.Assoon asthefishermen felthim intheir net,theyhauled it
inandtook thefishout ;they didnotkillhim atonce,butflunghimalive
onthesands. [211] "We'll cookhim intheembei's forourmeal," said
they ;andaccordingly they settowork tolight afireandwhittle aspitto
roasthimon.The fishlamented, saying tohimself, "It's notthetorture
oftheembers ortheanguish ofthespitoranyother pain thatgrieves me;
butonly thedistressing thought thatmywifeshould beunhappy inthe
belief that Ihavegone offwith another." Andherepeated thisstanza :
'Tisnotthecold, theheat, orwounding net;
'Tisbutthefearmydarling wifeshould think
Another's lovehaslured herspouse away.
Just then thepriest came totheriverside with hisattendant slaves
tobathe. Now heunderstood thelanguage ofallanimals. Therefore,
when heheard thefish's lamentation, hethought tohimself, "This fish is
lamenting thelament ofpassion. Ifheshould dieinthisunhealthy state
ofmind, hecannot escape rebirth inhell. Iwillsavehim." Sohewent
tothefishermen aad said, "Mymen, don't yousupply uswith afish

"praytakeaway withyouany fishyoumaytakeafancy to." "Wedon't

Taking thetishinhistwohands, theBodhisatta seated himself onthe

metyour death. Cease forthefuture tobetheslave ofpassion." And
with thisexhortation hethrew the fishintothewater, andwent intothe
city.
[212] Hislesson ended, theMaster preached theTruths, attheclosewhereof

"With wings thatflynot."—This storywas toldbytheMaster, whilst on
analms-pilgrimage through Magadha, about thegoing-out ofajungle fire.
Once theMaster, whilst onanalms-pilgrimage through Magadha, went on
hismorning round foralms through acertain hamlet inthat country; on
hisreturn, after hismeal, hewent outagain followed bythecompany of
theBrethren. Just then agreat firebroke out. There werenumbers of
Brethren both infront oftheMaster andbehind him. Oncame the fire,
spreading farandwide, till allwasonesheet ofsmoke andflame. Hereupon,
some unconverted Brethren were seized with thefearofdeath. "Let usmake a
counter fire," they cried ;"andthen thebig firewillnotsweep overtheground
wehave fired." And, with this view, they setabout kindling afirewith their
tinder-sticks.
Butothers said, "What isthisyou do.Brethren ?You arelikesuch as

from theeast, ortheseaonwhose shores they stand, orMount Sineru towering

together from front and rear alike, theBrethren inabody flocked round
theLord ofWisdom. Atacertain spot theMaster halted, with thismighty
assembly oftheBrethren surrounding him.Onrolled theflames, roaring
asthough todevour them. Butwhen theyapproached thespotwhere the
Buddha hadtaken hisstand, theycame nonearer than sixteen lengths, but
there andthenwent out,—even asatorch plunged into water. Ithadno
power tospread overaspace thirty-two lengths indiameter.

TheBrethren burst into praises oftheMaster, saying, "Oh !howgreat are
thevirtues ofaBuddha! For,even this fire,though lacking sense, could
notsweep over thespotwhere aBuddha stood, butwent out likeatorch in
water. Oh !howmarvellous arethepowers ofaBuddha!"
[213] Hearing their words, theMaster said, "Itisnopresent power ofmine,
Brethren, thatmakes this firegooutonreaching thisspot ofground. Itis
thei^ower ofaformer 'Act ofTruth' ofmine. For inthisspotnofire will
burn throughout thewhole ofthis aeon,—themiracle being onewhich endures
foranseon^."_
Then theElderAnanda folded arobe intofourandspread itfortheMaster to
siton.TheMaster took his seat. Bowing totheBuddha ashesatcross-
legged there, theBrethren tooseated themselves around him. Then theyasked
him, saying, "Only thepresent isknown tous,sir ;thepast ishidden from
us.Make itknown tous." And, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthe
joast.
Once upon atime intliisselfsame spot inMagadha, itwasasaquail
that theBodhisatta came tolifeonce more. Breaking hiswayoutofthe
shell oftheegginwhich hewasborn, hebecame ayoung quail, about as
bigasalarge ball^. And hisparents kepthimlying inthenest, while
they fedhimwith foodwhich theybrought intheir beaks. Inhimself, he
hadnotthestrength either tospread hiswings and flythrough the air,or
tolifthisfeetandwalkupon theground. Year after year that spotwas
always ravaged byajungle-fire;and itwasjust atthistime that the
flames sweptdown onitwith amighty roaring. The flocks ofbirds, dart-
ingfrom their several nests, were seized with thefear ofdeath, andflew
shrieking away. Thefather andmother oftheBodhisatta were asfrightened
astheothers andflewaway, forsaking theBodhisatta. Lying there inthe
nest, theBodhisatta stretched forth hisneck,andseeing theflames spreading
towards him,hethought tohimself, "Had Ithepower toputforthmy
wings and fly,Iwould wingmywayhence tosafety;or,ifIcouldmove
mylegsandwalk, Icould escape elsewhere afoot. Moreover, myparents,
seized with thefear ofdeath, arefledaway tosave themselves, leaving
mehere quite alone intheworld. Iamwithout protector orhelper.
What, then, shall Idothisday ?"
Then thisthought came tohim :—"Inthisworld there exists what is
termed theESicacy ofGoodness, andwhat istermed theEflicacy ofTruth.
There arethose who,through their having realised thePerfections inpast
ages,have attained beneath theBo-tree tobeAll-Enlightened;who,having
won Release bygoodness, tranquillity andwisdom, possess also discern-
ment oftheknowledge ofsuch Release; [214]who are filled with truth,
compassion, mercy, andpatience ;whose loveembraces allcreatures alike;
whommen callomniscient Buddhas. There isanefficacy intheattributes

ofthepast,andtheEfficacy theyhavewon,and tolayhold ofthetrue
belief that isinmetoiiching theprinciple ofNature ;andbyanActof

Therefore ithasbeen said:—
There's saving grace inGoodness inthisworld;
There's truth, compassion, purity oflife.
Thereby, I'llwork amatchless ActofTruth.
Remembering Faith's might, andtaking thought
Onthosewhotriumphed inthedays gone by,
Strong inthetruth, anActofTruth Iwrought.
Accordingly, theBodhisatta, calling tomind the efficacy ofthe
Buddhas long since pastaway, performed anActofTruth inthename of
thetrue faith thatwasinhim, repeating thisstanza:—
With wings that flynot, feetthatwalk notyet,
Forsaken bymyparents, here Ilie !
Wherefore Iconjure thee, dread Lord ofFire,
Primaeval Jataveda, turn !goback !
Even asheperformed hisActofTruth, Jataveda went back aspace of
sixteen lengths ;andingoing back theflames didnotpassaway tothe
forest devouring everything intheir path. No;theywent outthere and
then, likeatorch plunged inwater. Therefore ithasbeen said:—
[215] Iwrought myActofTruth, andtherewithal
Thesheet ofblazing fire leftsixteen lengths
Unscathed, —likeflames bywater metandquenched.
And asthatspotescaped being wasted byfirethroughout awhole aeon,
themiracle iscalled an'seon-miracle.' When hislifeclosed, theBodhi-
satta,whohadperformed thisActofTruth, passed away tofareaccording
tohisdeserts.
"Thus, Brethren," said theMaster, "it isnotmypresent power butthe
efficacy ofanAct ofTruth performed bymewhen ayoung quail, that has
made theflames passover thisspot inthejungle." Hislesson ended, hepreached
theTruths, attheclosewhereof somewontheFirst, some theSecond, some the
Third Path, while others again became Arahats. Also, theMaster shewed
theconnexion andidentified theBirth bysaying, "Mypresent parents were the
parents ofthose days,and Imyself theking ofthequails."

"Fedenizens ofair."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aBrother whose cellwasburnt down.
Tradition saysthataBrother, having beengiven atheme formeditation bythe
Master, wentfromJetavana totheland ofKosala andthere abode inadwelling
inaforest hard byaborder-village. Now, during thevery firstmonth of
hisdwelling there, hiscellwasburnt down. Tliishereported tothevillagers,
saying, "My cellhasbeen burnt down; Ilive indiscomfort." Said they,
"The land issuffering from drought justnow; we'll seetoitwhen wehave
irrigated the fields." When theirrigation was over, they saidtheymust do
theirsowing first ;when thesowing wasdone, theyhadthefences toputup;
when thefences were putup,theyhad firsttodotheweeding andthereaping,
andthethreshing; till,what with onejobandanother which they kept
mentioning, three whole months passed by.
After three months spent intheopen airindiscomfort, thatBrother had
developed histheme formeditation, butcould getnofurther. So,after the
Pavarana-festival which ends theRainy Season, hewent back again tothe
Master," and, with due salutation, took hisseat aside. After kindly words
ofgreeting, theMaster said,"Well, Brother, haveyoulived ha[)pily through the
Rainy Season? Didyourtheme formeditation endinsuccess?" TheBrother
toldhim allthathadhappened, adding, "As Ihadnolodging tosuitme,
mytheme didnotendinsuccess."
Said theMaster, "In l^ygone times. Brother, even animals knew what
suited them andwhat did not.How isitthatyoudidnotknow T'And
sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
[216] Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abirdand lived round agiant treewith branching
boughs, atthehead ofacompany ofbirds. Now oneday, astheboughs
ofthistreewere grinding oneagainst theother, dustbegan tofall,soon
followed bysmoke. When theBodhisatta became aware ofthis,hethought
tohimself:—"Ifthese twoboughs goongrinding against oneanother
like this,they willproduce fire ;andthe firewill fallandcatch hold of
theoldleaves, andsocome tosetfiretothistreeaswell.Wecannot live
onhei-e; theproper thing todoistohasten ofi"elsewhere." And he
repeated thisstanza tothecompany ofbirds:—
Yedenizens ofair,that inthese boughs
Have sought alodging, mark theseeds offire
This earthborn tree isbreeding !Safety seek
Inflight !Ourtrusted stronghold harbours death !
Thewiser birdswhofollowed theBodhisatta's counsels, atonce roseup
intheairandwent elsewhere inhiscompany. Butthefoolish ones said,

"Itisalways likethiswithhim;he'salways seeing crocodiles inadrop of
water." And they, heeding nottheBodhisatta's words, stopped where they
were. Inavery short time, just astheBodhisatta had foreseen, flames
really didbreak out,andthe ti-eecaught fire.When thesmoke andflame
arose, thebirds, blinded bythesmoke, were unable togetaway; oneby
onetheydropped intotheflames andwere destroyed.
"Thus, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "inbygone times evenanimals whowere
dwelling inthetree-top, knewwhat suited them andwhat didnot.How isit
thatyoudidnotknow?" [217] Hislesson ended, hepreached theTruths, at
theclose whereof that Brother won the P'ruit oftheFirst Path. Also, the
Master shewed theconnexion, andidentitied theBirth bysaying, "The Buddha's
disciples werethen thebirdswhohearkened totheBodhisatta, and Imyself was

TITTIRA-JATAKA.
"For theywhohonour age."—This storywastoldbytheMaster whilst onhis
way toSavatthi, about theway inwhich theElder Sariputta waskept out
ofanight's lodging.
For,when Anatha-pindika had built hismonastery, andhadsentword
that itwasfinished, theMaster leftRajagaha andcame toVesali, setting outagain
onhisjourney after stopping atthelatter place during hispleasure. Itwas
now thatthedisciples oftheSixhurried onahead, and, before quarters could
betaken fortheElders, monopolized thewhole oftheavailable lodgings, which
they distributed among their superiors, their teachers, andthemselves. When
theElders cameuplater, they could findnoquarters atallforthenight. E^en
Sariputta's disciples, for alltheir searching, could not find lodgings forthe
Elder. Being without alodging, theElder passed thenight atthefoot of
atreenear the^Master's quarters, either walking u]ianddown orsitting atthe
footofatree.
Atearlydawn theMaster coughed ashecame out.TheElder coughed too.
"Who isthat?" asked theMaster. "It isI,Sariputta, sir.""What areyou
doing here atthis hour, Sariputta?" Then theElder told hisstory, atthe
close ofwhich theMaster thought, "Even now, while Iam still alive, the
Brethren lack courtesy andsubordination;what willthey notdowhen Iam
dead andgone?" And thethought filledhimwith anxiety fortheTruth.
Assoon asdayhadcome, hehadtheassembly oftheBrethren called together,
andasked them, saying, "Is ittrue, Brethren, asIhear, that theadherents
oftheSixwent onahead andkept theElders among theBrethren outof
lodgings forthenight?" "That isso.Blessed One," wasthereply. Thereupon,
withareproof totheadherents oftheSixandasalesson toall,headdressed the
Brethren, andsaid, "Tellme,whodeserves thebestlodging, thebestwater, and
thebest rice,Brethren?"


No. 37. 93
Some answered,"Hewhowasanobleman before hebecame aBrother." Others
said,"Hewhowasoriginally abrahmin, oraman ofmeans." Others severally
said,"Theman versed intheEules oftheOrder; themanwhocanexpound
theLaw; themenwhohavewonthe first, second, third, orfourth stage ofmystic
ecstasy." Whilst others again said,"Theman inthe First, Second, orThird
Path ofSalvation, oranArahat ;onewhoknows theThree Great Truths;one
whohastheSixHigher Knowledges."
After theBrethren hadstated whom they severally thought worthiest of
precedence inthematter oflodging andthe like, theMaster said, [218] "In
thereligion which Iteach, thestandard bywhich precedence inthematter
oflodging andthe like istobesettled, isnotnoble birth, orhaving been a
brahmin, orhaving beenwealthy before entry intotheOrder; thestandard isnot
familiarity with theEules oftheOrder, withtheSuttas, orwith theMetaphysical
Books 1;nor isiteither theattainment ofany ofthefour stages ofmystic
ecstasy, orthewalking inanyoftheFour Paths ofsalvation. Brethren, inmy
religion itisseniority which claims respect ofword anddeed, salutation, and
alldueservice ;itisseniors whoshould enjoy thebest lodging, thebestwater,
andthebest rice. This isthetrue standard, andtherefore thesenior Brother
ought tohnve these things. Yet, Bretliren, here isSariputta, who ismychief
disciple, whohassetrolling theWheel ofMinor Truth, andwho deserves to
have alodging next after myself. AndSariimtta hasspent thisnight without a
lodging atthefootofatree !Ifyoulackrespect andsubordination evennow,
what willbeyourbehaviour astime goesby?"
And fortheir further instruction hesaid, "Intimes past, Brethren, even
animals came totheconclusion that itwasnotproper forthem tolivewithout
respect andsubordination one toanother, orwithout theordering oftheir
common life;even these animals decided tofindoutwhich among them was
thesenior, andthen toshewhim allforms ofreverence. Sothey looked into
thematter, andhaving found outwhich ofthem wasthesenior, theyshewed
him allforms ofreverence, whereby they passed away atthat life's close to
people heaven." And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime, hard byagreat banyan-tree ontheslopes ofthe
Himalayas, there dwelt three friends,—apartridge, amonkey, andan
elephant. And theycame tolack respect and subordination one to
another, andhadnoordering oftheircommon life.And thethought
came tothem that itwasnotseemly forthem tolive inthisway,and
thattheyought tofindoutwhich oftheirnumber wasthesenior andto
honour him.
Astheywereengaged thinking which wastheoldest, onedayanidea
struck them. Said thepartridge andthemonkey totheelephant asthey
allthree sattogether atthefoot ofthat banyan-tree, "Friend elephant,
how bigwas thisbanyan when youremember itfirst?" Said the
elephant, "When Iwasababy, thisbanyan wasamere bush, overwhich
Iused towalk;and asIstood astride ofit,itstopmost branches used
just toreach uptomybelly. I'veknown thetree since itwasamere
bush."
'i.e.thethree divisions, or'three baskets,' oftheBuddhist scriptures,

Next themonkey wasasked thesame question bytheother two;and
hereplied, "My friends, when Iwasayoungling, [219] Ihadonly to
streich outmyneck asIsatontheground, andIcould eatthetopmost
sprouts ofthisbanyan. SoI'veknown thisbanyan since itwasvery
tiny."
Then thepartridge wasasked thesame question bythetwoothers;
andhesaid,"Friends, ofoldthere wasagreat banyan-tree atsuchand
such aspot ;Iateitsseeds, andvoided them here ;thatwastheorigin of
this tree. Therefore, Ihave knowledge ofthis treefrom before itwas
born, andamolder than thepairofyou."
Hereupon them.onkey andtheelephant said tothesage parti'idge,
"Friend, youaretheoldest. Henceforth yovi shall havefrom usacts of
honour andveneration, mai'ks ofobeisance andhomage, respect ofword
anddeed, salutation, and allduehomage ;andwewillfollow your counsels.
You foryour part hencefoi-th willplease impart such counsel asweneed."
Thenceforth thepartridge gavethem counsel, andestablished them in
theCommandments, which healsoundertook himself tokeep. Being
thus established intheCommandments, andbecoming respectful and
subordinate among themselves, with proper ordering oftheircommon
life, these three made themselves sure ofrebirth inheaven atthis life's
close.
"Theaims ofthese three "—continued theMaster—"came tobe
known asthe'Holiness ofthePartridge,' and ifthese three animals.
Brethren, lived together inrespect andsubordination, howcanyou,who
haveembraced aFaith theRules ofwhich aresowell-taught, livetogether
without duerespect andsubordination ?Henceforth Iordain, Brethi'en,
that toseniority shall bepaid respect ofwordanddeed, salutation, and all
dueservice ;that senioiity shall bethe title tothebest lodging, thebest
water, andthebest rice ;andnevermore letasenior bekept outof
alodging byajunior. Whosoever sokeeps outhissenior commits an
offence."
Itwasattheclose ofthislesson thattheMaster, asBuddha, repeated
thisstanza:—
Fortheywhohonour age, inTruth areversed;
Praise now,and bliss hereafter, istheir meed.
[220]When theMaster had finished speaking ofthevirtue ofreverencing
age,hemade theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "Moggallana
wastheelephant ofthose days, Sariputta themonkey, and Imy.self thesage
partridge."

''Guile profits not."—This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about atailoring Brother.
Tradition saysthat atJetavana dwelt aBrother whowasexceedingly skilful
inalloperations tobeperformed with arobe, such ascutting, joining, ar-
ranging, and stitching. Because ofthis skill, heused tofashion robes andso
gotthename of'The Robe-tailor.' What, you ask, didhedo?—Well, he
exercised hiscraft onoldbitsofclothandturned outanice softrobe, which,
after thedyeing wasdone, hewould enhance incolour with awash containing
flour tomake adressing, andrub itwith ashell, tillhehadmade itquite smart
andattractive. Then hewould layhishandiwork aside.
Being ignorant ofrobe-making, Brethren used tocome tohimwithbrand-new
cloth, saying, "We don'tknowhow tomake robes; youmakethem forus."
"Sirs," hewould reply, "arobe takes alongtimemaking; but Ihave one
which isjust finished. Youcantake that, ifyou willleave these cloths in
exchange." And, sosaying, hewould take hisoutandshew itthem. And they,
marking only itsfine colour, andknowing nothing ofwhat itwasmade ofj
thought itwasagood strong one,andsohanded over theirbrand-new cloth to
the'Robe-maker' andwent offwith therobe hegave them. When itgot
dirty andwasbeing washed inliotwater, itrevealed itsreal character, and
theworn patches were visible hereandthere. Then theowners regretted their
bargain. Everywhere thatBrother became well-known forcozening inthisway
allwhocame tohim.
Now, therewasarobe-maker inahamlet whoused tocozen everybody just
asthebrother didatJetavana. [221] Thisman's friends among theBrethren
saidtohim, "Sir, they saythat atJetavana there isarobe-maker whocozens
everybody just likeyou." Then thethought struck him,"Come now, letme
cozen that cityman !"Sohemade outofragsavery finerobe,which hedyed a
beautiful orange. Thisheputonandwent toJetavana. Themoment theother
saw it,hecoveted it,andsaid toitsowner, "Sir, didyoumake that robe?"
"Yes, Idid, sir,"wasthereply. "Letmehave that robe, sir; you'll getanother
initsplace." "But, sir,wevillage-Brethren find ithard togettheRequisites;
ifIgiveyou this,what shall Ihave towear myself?" "Sir, Ihavesome brand-
new cloth atmylodging; take itandmake yourself arobe." "Reverend sir,
herein have Ishewnmyownhandiwork ;but, ifyouspeak thus, what can I
do?Take it."Andhaving cozened theother byexchanging therag-robe for
thenew cloth, hewent hisway.
After wearing thebotched robe inhisturn, theJetavana manwaswashing
itnotlong afterwards inwarm water, when hebecame aware that itwasmade
outofrags; andhewasputtoshame. Thewhole oftheBrotherhood heard
thenews that theJetavana manhadbeen cozened byarobe-tailor from the
country.


96 TheJataha. Book I.
Now, onedaytheBrethren were seated intheHall ofTruth, discussing the
news,when theMaster entered andasked what theywere discussing;andthey
toldhim allabout it.
Said theMaster, "Brethren, this isnottheonly occasion oftheJetavana
robe-maker's cozening tricks ;inbygone times alsohedidjustthesame, and, as
hehasbeen cozened nowbythemanfrom thecountry, sowashetooinbygone
times." And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime theBodhisatta came tolifeinacertain forest-haunt
astheTree-sprite ofatreewhich stood near acertain lotus-pond. In
those days thewater used every summer tofallverylowinacertain
pond, notvery big,—which was plentifully stocked witli fish. Catching
sight ofthese fish,acertain crane saidtohimself, "Imust findaway to
cajole andeatthese fish." Sohewent and satdown indeepthought by
thesideofthewater.
Nowwhen thefishes caught sight ofhim,they said,"Ofwhat areyou
thinking, mylord, asyou sitthere"?" "Iamthinking about you," was
the reply. "And what isyour lordship thinking about us?" "The
water inthispoolbeing low, food scarce, andtheheat intense,—Iwas
wondering tomyself, asIsathere, what intheworld you fishes would
do.""And what arewetodo,mylord?" "Well, ifyou'll takemy
advice, [222] Iwilltakeyouuponebyoneinmybeak, andcarry you all
offtoafine lai'ge poolcovered with thefivevarieties oflotuses, and thei'e
putyoudown." "Mylord," said they, "nocrane evertook theslightest
thought forfishes since theworld began. Your desire istoeatusoneby
one." "No;Iwillnoteatyouwhile youtrustme," saidthecrane. "If
you don't takemyword that there issuch apond, send one ofyour
number togowithmeandseeforhimself." Believing thecrane, the fish
presented tohim agreat bigfish(blind ofoneeye,bytheway),whothey
thought would beamatch forthecrane whether afloat orashore ;and
they said, "Here's theonetogowith you."
Thecrane took thefishoffandputhim inthepool,andaftershewing
himthewhole extent ofit,brought himback again andputhiminalong
with theother fishinhisoldpond. And heheld forth tothem onthe
chai-ms ofthenew pool.
After hearing thisreport, theygrew eager togothere, andsaid tothe
crane, "Very good,mylord;please take usacross."
First ofall, tliecrane took that bigone-eyed fishagain andcarried
him offtotheedge oftiiepool, sothathecould seethewatei', butactually
alighted inaVarana-tree which grew onthebank. Dashing the fish
down inafork ofthe tree, hepecked ittodeath,—after which hepicked
him clean and letthebones fallatthefoot ofthe tree. Then back he
wentand said, "I'vethrown him in;who's thenextl"And sohetook

could notfindanother left. But there was stillacrabremaining inthe
pond; sothecrane, whowanted toeathimuptoo,said,"Mister crab, I've
taken allthose fishesaway andturned them intoafinelarge poolcovered
alloverwith lotuses. Come along; I'lltakeyoutoo." "How willyou
carrymeacross]" saidthecrab. "Why, inmybeak, tobesure," said
thecrane. "Ah, butyoumight dropmelike that," said thecrab; "I
won't gowith you." "Don't befrightened ;I'llkeep tight hold ofyou
alltheway." Thought thecrab tohimself, "Hehasn't putthefishinthe
pool. But, ifhewould really putmein,thatwould becapital. Ifhe
does not,—why, I'llniphishead offand killhim." Sohespoke thus to
thecrane, "You'd never beable toholdmetight enough, friend crane;
whereas wecrabs have gotanastonishingly tight grip. [22-3] IfImight
take hold ofyour neck withmyclaws, Icould hold ittight andthen
would goalong with you."
Notsuspecting that thecrabwanted totrick him, thecrane gave his
assent. With hisclaws thecrab gripped hold ofthecrane's neck aswith
thepincers ofasmith, and said, "Now youcanstart." Thecrane took
himandshewed himthepool first,andthen started off*forthetree.
"The pool liesthisway, nunky," saidthecrab; "but you're taking
metheother way." "Very much yournunky dearamI!" saidthe
crane ;"andverymuchmynephew areyou !Isuppose youthought me
your slave toliftyouupandcarry youabout !Justyoucastyour eyeon
thatheap ofbones atthefootofthetree ;asIateupallthose fish, soI
willeatyou too." Said thecrab, "Itwasthrough theirown folly that
those fishwere eaten byyou;butIshan't giveyouthechance ofeating
me.No ;what Ishall do, istokill i/07i. Foryou, foolthatyouwere,
didnotseethat Iwasti-icking you. Ifwedie,wewillboth dietogether;
I'llchop your head clean off"."And sosaying hegripped thecrane's
weazand with hisclaws, aswith pincers. With hismouth wide open, and
tears streaming from hiseyes, thecrane, trembling forhis life, said,
"Lord, indeed Iwillnoteatyou !Sparemy life !"
"Well, then, just stepdown tothepoolandputmein,"saidthecrab.
Then thecrane turned backandstepped down asdirected tothepool,and
placed thecrabonthemud, atthewater-edge. But the crab, before
entering thewater, nipped offthecrane's head asdeftly asifhewere
cutting alotus stalk with aknife.
The Tree- fairywhodwelt inthe tree,marking thiswonderful thing,
made thewhole forest ringwith applause repeating thisstanza insweet
tones:—

"Methinhs thegold.^^ —T\\\s, storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aco-resident pupil ofSariputta.
Tradition says that thisBrother wasmeek and docile, andwaszealous in
ministering totheElder. Now, ononeoccasion theElder departed with the
leave oftheMaster, onanalms-pilgrimage, andcame toSouth Magadha. When
hegotthere, that Brother grew soproud-stomached tliat hewould notdo
what theElder toldhim. Moreover, ifhewasaddressed with, "Sir,dothis," he
quarrelled with theElder. TheElder could notmake outwhat possessed him.
Aftermaking hisj^ilgrimage inthose parts, hecame back again toJetavana.
Themoment hegotback tothemonastery atJetavana, theBrother became
againwhat hehadalways been.
TheElder told this totheBuddha, saying, "Sir, aco-resident ofmine isin
oneplace likeaslave bought forahundred pieces, and inanother soproud-
stomached thatanorder todoanything makes himquarrel."
SaidtheMaster, "This isnotthe firsttime, Sariputta, thathehasshewn this
disposition ;inthepast too, ifhewent tooneplace, hewas likeaslavebought
forahundred pieces, whilst, ifhewent toanother place, hewould become
quarrelsome andcontentious." And, sosaying, byrequest oftheElder, hetold

Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asasquire. Another squire, afriend ofhis,
wasanoldman himself, buthad[225] ayoung wifewhohadborne hima

"My good Nanda, reveal thistreasure tomysonafter Iamgone, and

After giving thisinjunction tohisslave, theoldman died. Indue
course thesongrew up,and hismother said tohim, "My son,your
father, inthecomi)any ofNanda, buried hismoney. Get itbackandlook
after theproperty ofthefamily." 80onedayhesaid toNanda, "Nunky,

"Where isitburied1""Intheforest,mylord." "Well, then, letusgo

bythemoney thatheabused hismaster, saying, "Youservant ofaslave-
wench's son !howshould youhaveanymoney here?"
Theyoung gentleman, pretending nottohave heard this insolence,
simply said, "Letusbegoing then," andtook theslave backhome with
him.Two orthree days later, hereturned totheplace ;butagainNanda
abused him, asbefore. Without anyabusive rejoinder, theyoung gentle-
mancame back andturned thematter over inhismind. Thought heto
himself, "At starting, this slave always means toreveal where themoney
is;butnosooner doeshegetthere, than hefalls toabusing me.The
reason ofthis Idonotsee;but Icould find out, ifIwere toaskmy
father's oldfriend, thesquire." Sohewent totheBodhisatta, andlaying
thewhole business before him,asked hisfriend what wasthereal i-eason
ofsuch behaviour.
SaidtheBodhisatta, "Thespot atwhich Nanda stands toabuse you,
myfriend, istheplacewhere your father's money isburied. Therefore, as
soon ashestarts abusing youagain, saytohim,'Whom areyoutalking

And sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—[226]

''Far rather in'llIheadlong plunge."—This story was toldbytheMaster
while atJetavana, about Anatha- pindika.
ForAiiatha-pindika, whohadlavished fifty-four crores ontheFaith ofthe
Buddha overtheMonastery alone, andwhovalued naught elsesaveonlytheThree
Gems, used togoevery daywhile theMaster wasatJetavana toattend the
Great Services,—once atdaybreak, once after breakfast, and once inthe
evening. There were intermediate services too; buthenever went empty-
handed, forfeartheNovices andladsshould look toseewhat hehadbrought
withhim.When hewent intheearlymorning [227], heused tohave rice-gruel
taken up; after breakfast, ghee, butter, honey, molasses, andthelike;andin
theevening, hebrought perfumes, garlands and cloths. Somuch didheexpend
day after day, that hisexpense knew nobounds. Moreover, many traders
borrowed money fromhimontheir bonds,—totheamount ofeighteen crores;
and thegreat merchant never called themoney in.Furthermore, another
eighteen crores ofthefamily property, which were buried intheriver-bank, were
washed outtosea,when thebankwasswept away byastorm ;anddown rolled
thebrazen pots, with fastenings andsealsunbroken, tothebottom oftheocean.
Inhishouse, too,there wasalways ricestanding ready for500Brethren,—so
that themerchant's house was totheBrotherhood likeapooldugwhere four
roads meet, yea, likemother andfather washetothem. Therefore, even the
All-Enlightened Buddha used togotohishouse, andtheEighty Chief Elders
too ;andthenumber ofother Brethren passing inandoutwasbeyond measure.
Now hishouse wasseven stories highandhadseven portals ;andoverthe
fourth gateway dwelt afairywhowasaheretic. When theAll-Enlightened
Buddha came intothehouse, shecould notstay inherabode onhigh, butcame
down withherchildren totheground-floor ;andshehadtodothelikewhenever
theEighty Chief Elders ortheother Elders came inandout. Thought she,"So
long astheascetic Gotama and hisdisciples keepcoming into thishouse, Ican
havenopeace here; Ican't beeternally coming downstairs totheground floor.
Imust contrive tostopthem fromcoming anymore tothishouse." Sooneday,
when thebusiness manager hadretired torest, sheappeared before him in
visible shape.
"Who isthat?" said he.
"It isI,"wasthereply; "the fairywho lives over thefourth gateway."
"What brings youhere?" "You don't seewhat themerchant isdoing. Heedless
ofhisown future, heisdrawing upon hisresources, only toenrich theascetic
Gotama. Heengages innotraftic ;heundei-takes nobusiness. Advise the
merchant toattend tohisbusiness, andarrange thattheascetic Gotama with his
disciples shallcomenomore intothehouse."
Then said he,"Foolish Fairy, ifthemerchant does spend hismoney, he
spends itontheFaith oftheBuddha, which leads toSalvation. Even if
hewere toseizemebythehairand sellmeforaslave, Iwillsaynothing.
Begone!"
Another day,shewent tothemerchant's eldest sonandgavehimthesame
advice. Andheflouted herinjustthesame manner. But tothemerchant
himself shedidnotsomuch asdare tospeak onthematter.
Nowbydint ofunending munificence [228] andofdoing nobusiness, the
merchant's incomings diminished andhisestate grew lessand less; sothathe
sankbydegrees intopoverty, andhistable, hisdress, andhisbedandfoodwere
nolonger what theyhadonce been. Yet, inspite ofhisaltered circumstances,


No. 40. 101
hecontinued toentertain theBrotherhood, though hewasnolonger able tofeast
them. Soonedaywhen heiiadmade liisbowandtaken hisseat, theMaster said
tohim, "Householder, aregiftsbeing given atyour house"?" "Yes, sir,"saidhe;
"but there's onlyalittle sourhusk-porridge, leftoverfrom yesterday." "Benot
distressed, householder, atthethought thatyoucanonly oflferwhat isun-
palatable. Iftheheart begood, thefoodgiven toBuddhas, Pacceka Buddhas^,
andtheir disciples, cannot butbegood too.Andwhy?—Because ofthegreat-
ness ofthefruit thereof. Forhewhocanmake hisheart acceptable cannot
giveanunacceptable gift,— asistobetestified bythefollowing passage:—
For, iftheheart have faith, nogift issmall
ToBuddhas ortotheir disciples true.
'Tis saidnoservice canbereckoned small
That's paid toBuddhas, lords ofgreat renown.
Mark wellwhat fruit rewarded thatpoor gift
Ofpottage,—dried-up, sour,andlacking salt^."
Also, hesaid this fiu'ther thing, "Householder, ingiving thisunpalatable
gift,youaregiving ittothosewhohave entered ontheNoble Eightfold Path.
Whereas I,when inVelama's time Istirred upallIndia bygiving theseven
things ofprice, and inmylargesse poured them forth asthough 1hadmade
intoonemighty stream thefivegreat rivers,—Iyetfound nonewhohadreached
theThree Befuges orkept theFiveCommandments; forrare arethosewho
areworthy ofofferings. Therefore, letnotyour heart betroubled bythe
thought that your gift isunpalatable." And sosaying, herepeated the
Velamaka Sutta^.
Now that fairywhohadnotdared tospeak tothemerchant inthedays of
hismagnificence, thought thatnowhewaspoorhewould hearken toher,and so,
entering hischamber atdead ofnight sheappeared before him invisible shape,
standing inmid-air. "Who's thatf saidthemerchant, when hebecame aware
ofherpresence."Iamthefairy, great merchant, who dwells over thefourth
gateway." "What brings youhere?" "Togiveyoucounsel." "Proceed, then."
"Great merchant, youtakenothought foryourown future orforyourown
children. Youhaveexpended vastsums ontheFaith oftheascetic Gotama; in
fact,bylong-continued [229] expenditure andbynotundertaking newbusiness
youhave been brought bytheascetic Gotama topoverty. Buteven inyour

yourself totheascetic Gotama anddon't lethisdisciples setfoot inside youi-

and traffic inorder torestore thefamily estate."
Then hesaid toher,"Was thisthecounsel youwanted togiveme?"
"Yes, itwas."
Saidthemerchant, "The mighty Lord ofWisdom hasmademeproof against
ahundred, athousand, yeaagainst ahundred thousand fairies such asyouare!
Myfaith isstrong and steadfast asMount Sineru! Mysubstance hasbeen
expended ontheFaith thatleads toSalvation. Wicked areyourwords;itisa

childreu bythehandandweut forth. Butthough shewent, shewasminded, if
shecould notfind herself alodging elsewhere, toappease themerchant and
return todwell inhishouse ;andinthismind sherepaired tothetutelary deity
ofthecityandwithduesalutation stood before him. Being asked what had
brought herthither, shesaid,"My lord, Ihave been speaking imprudently to
Anatha-pindika, andheinhisanger hasturned meoutofmyhome. Takeme
tohimandmake itupbetween us,sothathemay letmelivethere again."
"Butwhatwas ityousaidtothemerchant?" "Itoldhim forthefuture notto
support theBuddha andtheOrder, andnottolettheascetic Gotama setfoot
again inhishouse. This iswhat Isaid,mylord." "Wicked wereyour woi-ds;
itwasablowaimed attheFaith. Icannot takeyouwithmetothemerchant."
Meeting withnosupport from him, shewent totheFour C4reat Regents ofthe
world. Andbeing repulsed bythem inthesame manner, shewentontoSakka,
king ofDevas, and toldhimherstory, beseeching him stillmore earnestly, as
follows, "Deva, finding noshelter, Iwander about homeless, leading mychildren
bythehand. Grantmeofyourmajesty some place wherein todwell."
Andhetoosaid tolier,"You havedone wickedly; itwasablowaimed at
theConqueror's Faith. Icannot speak tothemerchant onyour behalf. But I
can tellyouoneway [230] whereby themerchant maybeledtopardon you."
"Pray tellme,deva." "Alen have hadeighteen crores ofthemerchant on
bonds. Take thesemblance ofhisagent, andwithout telling anybody repair to
their houses with thebonds, inthecompany ofsomeyoung goblins. Stand inthe
middle oftheir houses withthebond inonehandandareceipt intheother, and
terrify them withyour goblin power, saying, 'Here's youracknowledgment of

nowheispoor, andyoumust payupthemoney you owe.' Byyour goblin
power obtain allthose eighteen crores ofgoldand fillthemerchant's empty
treasuries. Hehadanother treasure buried inthebanks oftheriver AciravatI,
butwhen thebankwaswashed away, thetreasiu'e wasswept intothesea. Get
thatback alsobyyoursupernatural power andstore itinhistreasuries. Further,
there isanother sum ofeighteen crores lyingunowned insuchandsuch aplace.
Bring thattooandpour themoney into hisempty treasuries. When youhave
atoned bytherecovery ofthese fifty-four crores, askthemerchant toforgive
you." "Very good, deva," said she.And shesettowork obediently, anddid
justasshehadbeen bidden. When shehadrecovered allthemoney, shewent
intothemerchant's chamber atdead ofnight andappeared before himinvisible
shape standing inthe air.
Themerchant asking whowas there, shereplied, "It isI,great merchant,
theblindandfoolish fairywho lived overyour fourth gateway. Inthegreatness
ofmyinfixtuate folly Iknew notthevirtues ofaBuddha, andsocame tosay
what Isaid toyousome days ago. Pardon memyfault !Attheinstance of
Sakka, king ofDevas, Ihavemade atonement byrecovering theeighteen crores
owing toyou, theeighteen crores which hadbeenwashed down intothesea,and
another eighteen crores which were lyingunowned insuchandsuchaplace,—
making fifty-four crores inall,which Ihavepoured intoyourempty treasure-
chambers. Thesumyouexpended ontheMonastery atJetavana isnowmade
upagain. Whilst Ihavenowhere todwell, Iaminmisery. Bear notinmind
what Ididinmyignorant folly, great merchant, butpardon me."
Anatha-pindika, hearing what shesaid,thought tohimself, "She isafairy,
andshesaysshehasatoned, andconfesses herfault. TheMaster shall consider
thisandmake hisvirtues known toher. Iwilltakeherbefore theAll-En-
lightened Buddha." Sohesaid,"Mygood fairy, ifyouwantmetopardon you,
askmeinthepresence ofthemaster." "Very good," said she,"1will.Takeme
along withyoutotheMaster." "Certainly," said he.And early inthemorning,
when night wasjustpassing away, hetook herwithhimtotheMaster, andtold
theBlessed One allthatshehaddone.
Hearing this, theMaster said,"You see,householder, how thesinfulman
regards sin[231] asexcellent before itripens toitsfruit. Butwhen ithas
rii)ened, thenhesees sintobesin. Likewise thegoodman looks onhisgoodness


No. 40. 103
assillbefore itripens toitsfruit; butvvheu itripens, liesees ittobegoodness."
And sosaying, herepeated these twostanzas from theDhamniapada: —
Thesinner thinks hissinful deed isgood.
Solong assinhasripened nottofruit.
Butwhen hissinatlast toripeness grows.
Thesinner surely sees"'twas sin Iwrought."
Thegoodman thinks hisgoodness isbut sin.
Solong asithasripened nottofruit.
Butwhen hisgoodness unto ripeness grows.
Thegoodman surely sees"'twas good Iwrought'."
Attheclose ofthese stanzas that fairywasestablished intheFruit ofthe
First Path. She fellattheWheel-marked feet oftheMaster, crying, "Stained
asIwaswith passion, depraved bysin,misled bydelusion, andblinded by
ignorance, Ispoke wickedly because Iknew notyour virtues. Pardon me!"
Then shereceived pardon from theJMaster andfrom thegreat merchant.
Atthistime Anatha-pindika sang hisown praises intheMaster's presence,
saying, "Sir, though this fairy didherbest tostopmefrom giving support to
theBuddha andhisfollowing, shecould notsucceed ;andthough shetried to
stopmefrom giving gifts, yet Igavethem still !Was notthisgoodness onmy
part?"
Said theMaster, "You, householder, areaconverted manandanelect
disciple; your faith isfirmandyour vision ispurified. Nomarvel then that
youwere notstopped bythisimpotent fairy. Themarvel wasthatthewiseand
good ofabygone da}',when aBuddha hadnotappeared, andwhen knowledge
hadnotripened toitsfull fruit, should from theheart ofalotus-flower have
given gifts, although MUra, lordoftheRealm ofLusts, appeared inmid-heaven,
shouting, 'Ifyougive gifts, you shall beroasted inthis hell,'—andshewing
them therewithal apiteighty cubits deep, filled with red-hot embers." And so
saying, attherequest ofAnatha-pindika, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahraadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolife inthefamily oftheLordHigh Treasurer of
Benares, andwasbrought upinthelapofallluxury likearoyal prince.
Bythetimehewascome toyears ofdiscretion, being barely sixteen years
old,hehadmade himself perfect inallaccomplishm(;nts. Athisfather's
death hefilled theoffice ofLordHigh Treasurer, and built sixalmonries,
oneateach ofthefourgates ofthecity,oneinthecentre ofthecity,and
oneatthegate ofhisownmansion. Very bountiful washe[232], andhe
kept thecommandments, andobserved thefast-day duties.
Now onedayatbreakfast-time when dainty fareofexquisite taste and
variety wasbeing brought infortheBodhisatta, aPacceka Buddha rising
fi'om aseven days' trance ofmystic ecstasy, and noticing that itwas
time togohisrounds, bethought himthat itwould bewell tovisit the
Treasurer ofBenares thatmorning. Sohecleaned histeeth with atooth-
stickmade from thebetel-vine, washed hismouth with water fromLake
Anotatta, putonhisunder-cloth ashestood onthetableland ofManosila,
fastened onhisgirdle, donned hisouter-cloth ;and,equipped with abowl

which hecalled intobeiug forthepurpose, hepassed through theairand
arrived atthegateofthemansion just astheBodhisatta's breakfast was
taken in.
Assoon astheBodhisatta became aware ofhispresence there, herose
atoncefrom hisseatandlooked attheattendant, indicating thataservice
was required. "What amItodo,mylord?'' "Bring hisreverence's
bowl," saidtheBodhisatta.
Atthat very instant Mara theWicked roseupinastate ofgreat
excitement, saying, "Itisseven days since thePacceka Buddha hadfood
givenhim;ifhegetsnone to-day, hewillperish. Iwilldestroy himand
stoptheTreasurer toofrom giving." And thatvery instant hewent and
called intobeing within themansion apitofred-hot embers, eighty cubits
deep, filled with Acacia-charcoal, allablaze andaflame likethegreat hell
ofAvici. When hehadcreated this pit,Mara himself took hisstand in
mid-air.
When themanwhowasonhiswaytofetch thebowlbecame aware of
this,hewas terrified andstarted back. "What makes youstart back,my
mani" asked theBodhisatta. "My lord," wastheanswer, "there's a
great pitofred-hot enibeis blazing andflaming inthemiddle ofthe
house." And asman afterman gottothespot, they allwere panic-
stricken, andranaway asfastastheir legswould carry them.
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "Mara, theEnthraller, must have
been exerting himself to-day tostopmefrom alms-giving. Ihave yetto
learn, however, that Iamtobeshaken byahundred, orbyathousand,
Maras. Wewillseethisdaywhose strength isthestronger, whose might
isthemightier, mine orMara's." Sotakiug inhisownhand thebowl
which stood ready, hepassed outfrom thehouse, and, standing onthe
brink ofthe fiery pit,looked uptotheheavens. Seeing Mara, hesaid,
"Who areyou ]""IamMara," wastheanswer.
"Didyou callintobeing this pitofred-hot embers 1" "Yes, Idid."
[233]"Why 1""To stopyoufrom alms-giving andtodestroy the life
ofthatPacceka Buddha." "Iwillnotpermit youeither tostopmefrom
myalms-giving ortodestroy thelifeofthePacceka Buddha. Iamgoing
toseeto-day whether your strength ormine isthegreater." And still
standing onthebrink ofthat fiery pit,hecried, "Keverend Pacceka
Buddha, eventhough Ibeinacttofallheadlong into thispitofred-hot
embers, Iwillnot tui-n back. Only vouchsafe totake thefood Ibring."
And sosaying herepeated thisstanza:—
Farrather will Iheadlong plunge amain
Full inthisgulf ofhell,than stoop toshame I
Vouchsafe, sir,atmyhands totake thisalms!
With these words theBodhisatta, grasping thebowl offood, strode on
withundaunted resolution right ontothesurface ofthepitoffire. But

even ashedid bO,there roseuptothesurface through alltheeighty
cubits ofthe pit'sdepth alargeandpeerless lotus-flower, which received
thefeet oftheBodhisatta !Andfrom ittherecame ameasure ofpollen
which fellonthehead oftheGreat Being, sothat hiswhole body wasas

theheart ofthelotus, hepoured thedainty food intothebowl ofthe
Pacceka Buddha.
Andwhen thelatter hadtaken thefoodandreturned thanks, heflung
hisbowl aloft intotheheavens, andright inthesight ofalltliepeople he
himself rosebodily iuto theairlikewise, andpassed away totheHimalayas
again, seeming totread atrack formed ofclouds fantastically shaped.
And Mara, too,defeated and dejected, passed away back tohisown
abode.
But theBodhisatti, stillstanding inthe lotus, preached ['234] the
Truth tothepeople, extolling alms-giving andthecommandments ;after
which, girtround bytheescorting multitude, hepassed into hisown
mansion once more. And allhislifelongheshewed charity anddidother
good works, tillintheendhepassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
Said theMaster, "Itwasnomarvel, layman, that you,withyour discern-
ment ofthetruth, were notovercome nowbythefairy ;therealmarvel was
what thewiseandgood didinbygone dayss." Hislesson ended, theMaster
shewed theconnexion, andidentified theBirth bysaying, "The Pacceka iJuddha
ofthose days passed away, never tobeborn again. 1wasmyself theTreasurer
ofBenares who, defeating Mara, andstanding intheheart ofthelotus, placed
alms inthebowl ofthePiicceka Buddha."

LOSAKA-JATAKA.
"Theheadstrong manP—This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about theElder Losaka Tissa.
'Who,' you assk,'was thisElder Losaka Tissa.^'Well; hisfather wasa
tisherman inKosala, andhewasthebane ofhisfamily;and,when aBrother,
never hadanything given tohim. Hisprevious existence ended, hehadbeen
conceived byacertain fisherman's wife inafishing-village ofathousand families

thelikebadfortune dogged themfrom thatdayforward. Also, before hisbirth,
thevillage wasdestroyed seven times by fire,andvisited seven times bythe
king's vengeance. Sointime itcame topassthatthepeople fellintoawretched
plight. Reflecting thatsuchhadnotbeen their lotinformer days, butthatnow
they were going torackand ruin, they concluded that there must besome
breeder ofmisfortune among them, andresolved todivide intotwobands. This
they did;andthere werethentwobauds offivehundred families each. Thence-
forward, ruindogged theband which included theparents ofthefuture Losaka,
whilst theother fivehundred families throve apace. Sotheformer resolved togo
onhalving theirnumbers, anddidso,until thisonefamily wasparted from all
the rest. Then theyknew that thebreeder ofmisfortune was inthat family,
andwithblows drovethem away. [235]With difficulty could hismother geta
livelihood; but,when hertimewascome, shegave birth toherson ina
certain place. (Hethat isborn into hislastexistence cannot bekilled. For
likealamp within ajar, even sosecurely within hisbreast burns theflame ofhis

runabout, andwhen hecould runabout then sheputapotsherd inhishands,

child used tobeghisfoodthereabouts andsleep where hecould. Hewasun-

flungaway therinsings oftherice-pots.
Sariputta, Captain oftheFaith, going intoSavatthi onhisround foralms,
noticed thechild, and,wondering what village thehapless creature came from,
was filled with love forhimand called out"Come here." The child came,
bowed totheElder, andstood before him. Then saidSariputta, "What village
doyoubelong to,andwhere areyour parents.'"
"Iamdestitute, sir,"' saidthechild; "formyparents saidtheywere tired

"Would you like tobecome aBrotherT'"Indeed Ishould, sir;butwho

'Losaka Tissa willpassaway to-day;andto-day atanyrate Iwillseethathe

because Losaka waswith him, itwas allinvain that Sariputta held outhis
hand foralms inpopulous Savatthi ;notsomuch asabowwasvouchsafed him.
Sohebade theElder gobackandseathimself inthesitting- halloftheMonastery,
andcollected foodwhich hesentwithamessage [236] that itwastobegiven to

forgetting allabout Losaka, ate itthemselves. Sowhen Sariputta rose up,and
wasentering themonastery, Losaka came tohimandsaluted him. Sariputta
stopped, andturning round said, "Well, didyougetthefood, brother?"
"Ishall, nodoubt, get itingood time," said theElder. Sariputta was
greatly troubled, andlooked toseewhat hour itwas. Butnoon waspassed i.
"Stay here, Brother," saidSariputta; "and donotmove"; andhemade Losaka
Tissa sitdown inthe sitting-hal), and setout forthepalace oftheking of

therefore notthetime toeat rice, ordered hisbowl tobefilled with thefour
sweet kinds offood-. With thishereturned, andstood before him,bowl in

reverence hehadtowards Sariputta, andwould noteat. "Come, brother Tissa,"
saidSariputta, "'tis Imust stand with tliel)owl ;sityoudown and eat. Ifthe

whereby existence ceases forever.
TheAll-Enlightened Buddha stood by,andsawthebodyburned ;andthey
built ashrine forthecollected ashes.
Seated inconclave intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren said, "Brethren,
Losaka wasunlucky, and little wasgiven tohim.Howcame hewith his
unluck andhisneediness towintheglory ofArahabshipT'
Entering theHall, theMaster asked what theywere talking about ;andthey
toldhim. "Brethren," said he,"this Brother's own actions were thecause both
ofhisreceiving solittle, andofhisbecoming anArahat. Inbygone dayshehad
prevented others from receiving, andthat iswhyhereceived solittle himself.
But itwasbyhismeditating onsorrow, transitoriness, andtheabsence ofan
abiding principle inthings, that hewonArahatship forhimself." And so
saying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once iijjon atime, inthedays oftheBuddha Kassapa, there wasa
Brother who lived thevillage lifeandwasmaintained byacountry squire.
Hewasregular inhisconduct asaBrother^, virtuous inhis life,andwas
filled tooverflowing with insight. There was alsoanElder, anArahat,

thisBrother. Sopleased wasthesquire [237] with theverydemeanour of
theEkler that, taking hisbowl, heledhimintothehouse andwith every
mark ofrespect invited him toeat.Then helistened toashort discourse
bytheElder, andatitsclose said, with abow, "Sir, praydonotjourney
further than ourmonastery close by;intheevening Iwillcome and call
uponyouthere." SotheElder went tothemonastery, saluting theresident
Brother onhisentrance ;and, firstcourteously asking leave, took aseatby
hisside.TheBrother received himwith allfriendliness, andasked whether
anyfoodhadbeen given him asalms.
"Oh yes," replied theElder. "Where, pray?" "Why, inyour village
close by,atthesquire's house." And sosaying, theElder asked tobe
shewn hiscellandmade itready. Then laying aside hisbowland robe,
andseating himself, hebecame absorbed inblissful Insight andenjoyed
thebliss oftheFruits ofthePaths.
Intheevening came thesquire, with servants carrying flowers and
perfumes and lamjjs and oil. Saluting theresident Brother, heasked
whether aguest hadappeared, anElder. Being told that hehad, the
squire asked where hewasandlearned which cellhadbeen given him.
Then thesquire went totheElder and, fii'stbowing courteously, seated
himself bytheElder's sideandlistened toadiscourse. Inthecool oftiie
evening thesquire made hisofferings attheTope andBo-Tree, lithis
lamp, anddeparted withaninvitation toboth Elder andBrother tocome
uptohishouse nextdayfortheir meal.
"I'm lo.singmyholdonthesquire," thought theBrother. "Ifthis
Elder stops, Ishall count fornothiug with him." Sohewasdiscontented
and fella-scheming how tomake theElder seethathemust not settle
down there forgood. Accordingly, when theElder came topay his
respects intheearly morning, theBrother didnotopen his lips. The
Arahat read the other's thoughts and said tohimself, "This Brother
knows notthat Ishall never stand inhislight either with thefamily that
supports himorwith hisBrotherhood." And going back tohis cell,he
became absorbed inthebliss ofInsight andinthebliss oftheFruits.
Next day,theresident Brother, having firstknocked gingerly onthe
gong', andhaving tapped onthegong with theback ofhisnail,went off
alone tothesquire's house. Taking fromhim hisalms-bowl, thesquire
badehimbeseated andasked where thestranger was.

(Meantime theArahat, whohadwaited tillthetimecame togohis
round foralms, hadwashed anddressed andrisen withbowlandrobe in
theairandgone elsewhere.)
Thesquire gave theBrother riceandmilk toeat,withgheeandsugar
andhoney in it.Then hehad hisbowl scoured withperfumed chunam
powder and filled afresh, saying, "Sir,theElder must befatigued with
hisjourney; takehim this." Without demur theBrother took thefood
andwent hisway, thinking tohimself, "Ifourfriend once getsataste of
this, taking himbythethroat andkicking himoutofdoors won't getrid
ofhim. Buthow canIgetridofit? IfIgive itaway toahuman
being, itwillbeknown. IfIthrow itintothewater, theghee will float
ontop.And asforthrowing itaway ontheground, that willonlybring
allthecrows ofthedistrict flocking tothe s])ot." Inhisperplexity his
eye fellonafield thathadbeen fired, and, scraping outtheembers, he
flung thecontents ofhisbowl intothehole, filled intheembers onthe
top,andwent off"home. Notfinding theElder there, hethought thatthe
Arahat hadunderstood hisjealousy anddeparted. "Woe isme," he
cried, "formygreed hasmademetosin."
And thenceforth sore aflliction befell himandhebecame like aliving
ghost. Dying soon aftei-, hewasre-born inhellandtherewastormented
forhundreds ofthousands ofyears. Byreason ofhisripening sin,infive
hundred successive births hewasanogreandnever hadenough toeat,
except onedaywhen heenjoyed asurfeit ofoff"al. Next, forfivehundred
more existences hewasadog,andhere too,onlyononesingle dayhadhis

Evenwhen heceased tobeadog,hewasonlyborn intoabeggar family
inaKasi village. Fi-om thehour ofhisbirth, that family became still
more beggared, andhenever gothalf asmuch water-gruel ashewanted.
Andhewascalled Mitta-vindaka [239].
Unable atlasttoendure thepangs ofhunger' thatnowbeset them, his
father andmother beathimanddrove himaway, crying, "Begone, you
curse!"
Inthecourse ofhiswanderings, thelittle outcast came toBenares, where
inthose days theBodhisatta wasateacher ofworld-wide fame with five
hundred young Brahmins toteach. Inthose times theBenares folkused to

andheedless ofhismaster's reproofs ;andsotheBodhisatta's fees fell off.
And ashequarrelled so,andwould notlirook reproof, theyouth ended by
running away, andcame toaborder-village where hehired himself outfor
aliving, andmarried amiserably poorwoman bywhom hehadtwo chil-
dren. Later, thevillagers paidhim toteach themwhatwastruedoctrine
andwhatwas false, andgavehimahuttoliveinattheentrance totheir
village. But, allbecause ofMitta-vindaka's coming toliveamong them,
theking's vengeance fellseven times onthose villagers, andseven times
were theirhomes burned totheground ;seven times toodidtheir water-
tankdryup.
Then they considered thematter andagreed that itwasnotsowith
them before Mitta-vindaka's coming, butthatever since hecame theyhad
been going frombad toworse. Sowithblows theydrove himfrom their
village ;andforth hewent with hisfamily, andcame toahaunted forest.
And there thedemons killed and atehiswifeand children. Fleeing
thence, hecame aftermany wanderings toavillage onthecoast called
Gambhira, amving onadaywhen ashipwasputting tosea;andhe
hired himself forservice aboard. Foraweek theship heldonherway,
butontheseventh dayshecame toacomplete standstill inmid-ocean, as
though shehadrunupon arock. Then they cast lots, inorder torid
them oftheir bane ;andseven times thelotfellonMitta-vindaka, So
theygavehimaraftofbamboos, andlaying hold ofhim, casthim over-
board. And forthwith theshipmadewayagain [240].
Mitta-vindaka clambered ontohisbamboos andfloated onthewaves.
Thanks tohishaving obeyed thecommandments inthetimes ofthe
Buddha Kassapa, hefound inmid-ocean fourdaughters ofthegods dwell-
inginapalace ofcrystal, withwhom hedwelt happily forseven days.
Now palace-ghosts enjoy happiness only forseven days atatime;and
so,when theseventh daycame andtheyhad todepart totheir j)unish-
ment, they lefthimwith aninjixnction toawait their return. Butno
sooner were they departed, thanMitta-vindaka putoffonhisraftagain
andcame towhere eight daughters ofthegods dwelt inapalace ofsilver.
Leaving them inturn, hecame towhere sixteen daughters ofthegods
dwelt inapalace ofjewels, andthereafter towhere thirty-two dwelt ina
palace ofgold. Paying noregard totheir words, again hesailedaway and
came toacityofogres, setamong islands. And there anogress wasrang-
ingabout intheshape ofagoat. Notknowing thatshewasanogress,
Mitta-vindaka thought tomake ameal offthegoat,andseized hold ofthe
creature bythe leg. Straightway, byvirtue ofherdemon-nature, she
hurled himupandaway over theocean, andplump hefellinathorn-
brake ontheslopes ofthedrymoat ofBenares, andthence rolled to
earth.
Now itchanced that atthattime thieves used tofi-equent thatmoat

and killtheKing's goats ;andthegoatherds hadhidden themselves hard
bytocatch therascals.
Mitta-vindaka picked himself upandsawthegoats. Thought heto
himself,"Well, itwasagoat inanisland intheocean that, being seized
bytheleg,hurled mehereover seas. Perhaps, ifIdothesamebyoneof
these goats, Imay gethurled back again towhere thedaughters ofthe
gods dwell intheir ocean palaces." So,without thinking, heseized oneof
thegoats bythe leg.Atonce thegoatbegan tobleat, andthegoatherds
came running upfrom every side. They laidhold ofhimatonce, crying,
"This isthethief thathassolong livedontheKing's goats." And they
beathimandbegan tohaulhimaway inbonds totheKing.
Just atthattime theBodhisatta, with hisfivehundred young Brah-
minsround him,wascoming outofthecitytobathe. Seeing andrecog-
nising Mitta-vindaka, hesaid tothegoatherds, "Why, this isapupil of
mine,mygoodmen; what haveyouseized himfor?" "Master," saidthey,
"wecaiight this thief intheactofseizing agoatbythe leg,and that's
why we've gothold ofhim." "Well," [241] saidtheBodhisatta, "sup-
poseyouhandhimover toustolivewith usasourslave." "All right,
sir," replied themen,and letting their prisoner go,theywent their way.
Then theBodhisatta asked Mitta-vindaka where hehadbeen allthatlong
time; andMitta-vindaka toldhim allthathehaddone.
"'Tisthi'ough nothearkening tothosewhowished him well," said
theBodhisatta, "that hehassuffered allthese misfortunes." And Ik;
recited thisstanza:—
Theheadstrong manwho,when exhorted, pays
Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give.
Shallcome tocertain harm,—likeMittaka,
When bythelegheseized thegrazing goat.
And inthose times both thatTeacher andMitta-vindaka passed away,
andtheir after-lot wasaccordinf; totheir deeds.
SaidtheMaster, "This Losaka washimself thecause both ofhisgetting little
andofhisgetting Arahatship." Hislesson ended, heshewed theconnexion and
identified theBirth bysaying, "The Elder Losaka Tissa wastheMitta-vindaka

"Theheadstrong man."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about acertain greedy Brother. Hisgreediness willberelated intheNinth
Book intheKaka- Jataka i.
Butonthisoccasion theBrethren toldtheMaster, saying, "Sir, thisBrother
isgreedy."
SaidtheMaster, "Is ittrue [242] asthey say,Brother, thatyouaregreedy?"
"Yes, sir,"wasthereply.
"So tooinbygone days, Brother, youwere greedy, andbyreason ofyour
greediness lostyour life ;alsoyoucaused thewiseandgood tolosetheirhome."
And sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodlii-
sattawasborn apigeon. Now theBenares folkofthose days, asanactof
goodness, used tohangupstraw-baskets indivers places fortheshelter
andcomfort ofthebirds; andthecook oftheLordHigh Treasurer of
Benares hung uponeofthese baskets inhiskitchen. Inthisbasket the
Bodhisatta tookuphisabode, sallying outatdaybreak iuquest offood,
andreturning home intheevening; andsohelived his life.
Butonedayacrow, flying over thekitchen, snuffed upthegoodly
savour from thesaltandfresh fishandmeat there, andwas filled with
longing totaste it.Casting about how tohave hiswill,heperched hai'd
by,andatevening sawtheBodhisatta comehome andgointothekitchen.
"Ah !"thought he,"Icanmanage itthrough thej)igeon."
Sobackhecame nextdayatdawn, and,when theBodhisatta sallied
outinquest offood, kept following himabout from place toplace like his
shadow. SotheBodhisatta said, "Why doyoukeepwithme,friend?"
"My lord," answered thecrow, "your demeanour haswonmyadmira-
tion; andhenceforth itismywish tofollow you." "But your kind of
foodandmine, friend, isnotthesame," said theBodhisatta; "you will
behard put toitifyouattach yourself tome." "Mylord," saidthe
crow, "when youareseeking your food, Iwillfeed too,byyour side."
"Sobeit,then," saidtheBodhisatta; "only yonmust beearnest." And
with thisadmonition tothecrow, theBodhisatta ranged about pecking up
grass-seeds; whilst theother went about turning overcowdung andpick-

totheBodhisatta andremarked, "My lord,yougive toomuch time to

Andwhen theBodhisatta hadfedandreached home again atevening,
inflewthecrow withhimintothekitchen [243].
"Why, ourbirdhasbrought another home withhim;" exclaimed the
cook,andhungupasecond basket forthecrow. Andfrom thattime on-
ward thetwobirds dwelt together inthekitchen.
Now onedaytheLordHigh Treasurer hadinastore offishwhich the
cookhung upabout thekitchen. Filled with greedy longing atthesight,
thecrowmade uphismind tostay athome next dayand treat himself to
thisexcellent fare.
Soallthenight longhelaygroaning away;andnext day,when the
Bodhisatta wasstarting insearch offood,and cried, ''Come along, friend
crow," thecrow replied, "Gowithout me,mylord; forIhave apain inmy
stomach." "Friend," answered theBodhisatta, "Inever heard ofcrows
having pains intheir stomachs before. True, crows feelfaint ineach of
thethree night-watches; but ifthey eatalamp-wick, their hunger is
appeased forthemomenta Youmust behankering after the fishinthe
kitchen here. Come now, man's food willnotagree with you.Donot
giveway like this, butcome andseekyour foodwith me." "Indeed, I
amnot able,mylord," said thecrow. "Well, yourownconduct will
shew," said theBodhisatta. "Only fallnotaprey togreed, butstand
steadfast." And with thisexhortation, away heflew tofindhisdaily food.
Thecook took several kinds offish,anddressed some oneway,some
another. Then lifting thelids oft'hissaucepans alittle toletthesteam
out,heputacolander onthetopofoneandwent outside thedoor,where
hestood wiping thesweat from hisbrow. Just atthatmoment out
popped thecrow's headfrom thebasket. Aglance toldhimthatthecook
wasaway, and,"Now ornever," thought he,"ismytime. Theonly
question isshall Ichoose minced meat orabiglump?"Arguing that it

mymaster's dinner. Ihave towork formymaster, not forthat rascal!
What's hetome,Ishould liketoknow?" So, fir.stshutting thedoor, he
caught thecrowandplucked every feather [244] oft'hisbody. Then, he
pounded upginger with saltandcumin, andmixed insourbutter-milk—
finally sousing thecrow inthepickle and flinging himback into his

pain.
Atevening theBodhisatta came back, andsawthewretched plight of
thecrow. "Ah! greedy crow," heexclaimed, "you would notheedmy
words, andnowyourowngreed hasworked youwoe." Sosaying, he
repeated thisstanza :—
Theheadstrong man who,when exhorted, pays
Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give,

Who laughed toscorn thepigeon's warning words.
Then, exclaiming "Itoocannolonger dwell here," theBodhisatta
flewaway. Butthecrow died there andthen, andthecook flung him,
basket and all,onthedust-heap.
SaidtheMaster, "You were greedy, Brother, inbygone times, justasyouare
now;and allbecause ofyour greediness thewiseandgood ofthose dayshadto
abandon their homes." Having ended thislesson, theMaster preached theFour
Truths, attheclose whereof thatBrother won theFruit oftheSecond Path.
Then theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth asfollows:—

past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoawealthy family intheKingdom ofKasi.
Having come toyears ofdiscretion, hesawhowfrom passion springs pain
andhowtrue blisscomes bytheabandonment ofpassion. Soheputlusts
from him,andgoing forth totheHimalayas became ahermit, winning by
fulfilment oftheordained mystic meditations the five orders ofthe

Higher Knowledge and theeight Attainments, And ashelived his
lifeintherapture ofInsight, hecame inafter times tohave alarge
following offivehundred hermits, whose teacher hewas.
Now onedayayoung poisonous viper, wandering about asvipers do,
came tothehutofoneofthehermits ;andthatBrother grew asfond
ofthecreatiTre asifitwere hisown child, housing itinajoint ofhamboo
andshewing kindness toit.And because itwaslodged inajoint of
bamboo, theviper wasknown bythename of"Bamboo." Moreover,
because thehermit was asfond oftheviper asifitwere hisown child,
they called him"Bamljoo's Father."
Hearing thatoneoftheBrethren waskeeping aviper, theBodhisatta
sent forthatBrother andasked whether thereport was true.When
toldthat itwastrue, theBodhisatta said,"Aviper cannever betrusted;
keep itnolonger."
"But," urged theBrother, "my viper isdear tomeasapupil to
ateacher;—Icould notlivewithout him." "Well then," answered the
Bodhisatta, "know that thisvery snake will loseyouyour life." But
heedless ofthemaster's warning, thatBrother stillkept thepethecould
notbear topart with. Only avery fewdays later alltheBrethren
went outtogather fruits, andcoming toas})otwhere allkinds grew
inplenty, they stayed there two orthree days. With them went
"Bamboo's Father," leaving hisviper behind initsbamboo prison. Two
orthree days afterwards, when hecame back, hebethought himoffeeding
thecreature, and,opening thecane, stretched outhishand, saying, "Come,
myson;youmust behungry." Butangry with itslong fast,theviper
bithisoutstretched hand, killing himonthespot,andmade itsescape into
theforest.
Seeing himlying there dead, theBrethren came and toldtheBodhi-
satta [246], whobade thebody beburned. Then, seated intheir midst, he
exhorted theBrethren byrepeating thisstanza:—
Theheadstrong man, who,when exhorted, pays
Noheed tofriends whokindly counsel give,—
Like'Bamboo's father,' shall bebrought tonought.
Thus didtheBodhisatta exhort hisfollowers; andhedeveloped
within himself thefourNoble States, and athisdeath wasre-born into
theBrahma Realm.
SaidtheMaster, "Brother, this isnotthefirsttimeyouhaveshewn yourself

connexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "In tho.se days, thisheadstrong
Brother was'Bamboo's Father,' mydisciples were theband ofdisciples, and I

"Sense-lacl'ing friends."—This story was toldbytheMaster whilst onan
alms-pilgrimage inMagadha, about some stupid villagers inacertain hamlet.
Tradition says that, after travelling from Savatthi tothekingdom ofMagadha,
hewasonhisround inthatkingdom when hearrived atacertain hamlet, which
wasthronged with fools. Inthishamlet these foolsmettogether oneday,and
debated together, saying, "Friends, whenweareatwork inthejungle, the
mosquitos devour us;andthat hinders ourwork. Let us,arming ourselves
withbowsandweapons, gotowarwith themosquitos andshoot orhewthem all
todeath." So oft"tothejungle they went, and shouting, "Shoot down the
mosquitos," shotandstruck oneanother, tillthey were inasadstate and
returned only tosinkontheground inorwithin thevillage oratitsentrance.
Surrounded bytheOrder oftheBrethren, theMaster came inquest ofalms
tothat village. The sensible minority among theinhabitants nosooner saw
theBlessed One,than they erected apavilion attheentrance totheir village
and, after bestowing largealmsonthe[247] Brotherhood with theBuddha atits
head, bowed totheMaster andseated themselves. Observing wounded men
lying around onthis sideandonthat, theMaster asked those lay-brothers,
saying, "There arenumbers ofdisabled menabout ;what hashappened to
them?" "Sir," wasthereply, "they went forth towarwith themosquitos, but
only shotoneanother andsodisabled themselves." Said theMaster, "This is
notthe firsttime that these foolish people have dealt outblows tothem.selves
instead oftothemosquitos theymeant tokill ;informer times, also, there were
those who,meaning tohitamosquito, hitafellow-creatm-e instead." And so
saying, atthose villagers' request hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta gained hislivelihood asatrader. Inthose days inaborder-
village inKasi there dwelt anumber ofcarpenters. And itchanced that
one ofthem, abald grey-haired man, was ]»laning away atsome wood,
with hishead glistening like acopper bowl,when amosquito settled
onhisscalpandstung himwith itsdart-like sting.
Said thecarpenter tohisson,whowasseated hard by,—"My boy,
there's amosquito stinging meonthehead; dodrive itaway." "Hold
stillthen, father," saidtheson;"oneblow will settle it."
(Atthatverytime theBodhisatta hadreached that village intheway
oftrade, andwassitting inthecarpenter's shop.)
"Ridmeofit,"cried thefather. "All right, fivther," answered the
son,whowasbehind theoldman's back, and, raising asharp axeonhigh
with intent tokillonly themosquito, hecleft— hisfather's head intwain.
Sotheoldman felldeadonthespot.
Thought theBodhisatta, whohadbeenaneye-witness ofthewhole
scene,—"Better than such afriend isanenemy with sense,whom fear

lines:—
Sense-lacking friends areworse than foeswith sense;
Witness thesonthatsought thegnat toslay,
But cleft, poor fool, hisfather's skull intwain. [248]
Sosaying, theBodhisatta roseupanddeparted, passing away inafter
days tofareaccording tohisdeserts. And asforthecarpenter, hisbody
wasburned byhiskinsfolk.
"Thus, laybrethren," saidtheMaster, "inbygone times alsotherewere those
who, seeking tohitamosquito, struck down afellow-creatiu'e." This lesson
ended, heshewed theconnexion and identitied theBirth bysaying, "Inthose
days Iwasmyself thewiseandgood trader whodeparted after repeating the

"'Tw knotdedge." —This story wastoldbytheMaster inacertain hamlet of
Kosala about onewhospoiled apleasaunce.
Tradition says that, inthecourse ofanalms-journey among the\)eople of
Kosala, theMaster came toacertain hamlet. Asquire oftheplace invited the
Buddha totake themid-day meal athishouse, andhadhisguest seated inthe
pleasaunce, where heshewed hospitality totheBrotherhood with theBuddha at
itshead, andcourteously gavethem leave tostroll atwillabout hisgrounds. So
theBrethren rose u[)andwalked about thegrounds with thegardener. Ob-
serving intheir walk abare space, they said tothegardener, "Lay-disciple,
elsewhere inthepleasaiuice there isabundant shade ;buthere there's neither
treenorshrub. Howcomes this?"
"Sirs," replied theman,•'when these grounds were being laidout,avillage
lad,whowasdoing thewatering, pulled upalltheyoung trees hereabouts and
then gavethemmuch orlittle [250] water according tothesizeoftheir roots.
Sotheyoung trees withered anddied oft';andthat iswhy thisspace isbare."
Drawing near totheMaster, theBrethren toldhim this. "Yes, Brethren,"
.said he,"this isnotthe firsttime that village ladhasspoiled apleasaunce; he
didprecisely thesame inbygone times also." And sosaying, hetold thisstory
ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasking ofBenares, afestival

Now inthose clays, atribe ofmonkeys was living intheking's
pleasaunce; andtheking's gardener thought tohimself, "They 'reholiday-
making upinthe city. I'llgetthemonkeys todothewatering for
me,andbeofi'toenjoy myself with therest." Sosaying, hewent tothe
king ofthemonkeys, and, firstdwelling onthebenefits hismajesty and
hissubjects enjoyed from residence inthepleasaunce intheway offlowers
and fruit andyoung shoots toeat,ended bysaying, "To-day there's
holiday-making upinthecity,andI'm ofi'toenjoy myself. Couldn't you
water theyoung trees while I'maway?"
"Oh! yes," saidthemonkey.
"Only mind you do," said thegardener; and offhewent, giving the
monkeys thewater-skins andwooden watering-pots todothework
with.
Then themonkeys took thewater-skins andwatering-pots, and fellto
watering theyoung trees. "Butwemustmind nottowaste thewater,"
observed their king; "asyouwater, first pulleachyoung treeupand
look atthesizeofitsroots. Then give plenty ofwater tothose whose
roots strike deej), butonly alittle tothose with tiny roots. When tliis
water isallgone,weshall behardputtoittogetmore."
"Tobesure," saidtheother monkeys, anddidashebadethem.
Atthisjuncture acei'tain wiseman, seeing themonkeys thusengaged,
asked themwhythey pulled uptree after treeandwatered them according
tothesizeoftheir roots.
"Because such areourking's commands," answered themonkeys.
Their replymoved thewiseman toreflect how, with every desire
todogood, theignorant and foolish only succeed indoing harm. Andhe
recited thisstanza :[251]
'Tisknowledge crowns endeavour with success.
For fools arethwarted bytheir foolislmess,—Witness theapethat killed thegarden trees.
With thisrebuke totheking ofthemonkeys, thewiseman departed
with hisfollowers from thepleasaunce.

'"T^i's knoidedge.'' —Thi« story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about onewhospoiled spirits. Tradition says thatAnatha-pindika hadafriend
whokept atavern. This friend gotready asupply ofstrong spirits which he
sold forgoldandforsilveri,andhistavern wascrowded. Hegave orders tohis
apprentice tosellforcash only,andwent offhimself tobathe. This apprentice,
while serving outthegrog tohiscustomers, observed them sending outforsalt
andjagghery andeating itasawhet. Thought hetohimself, "There can't be
any saltinourliquor ;I'llputsome in."Soheputapound ofsaltinabowl of
grog,andserved itouttothecustomers. Andtheynosooner tookamouthful,
thanthey spat itoutagain, saying, "What haveyoubeenupto?" "Isawyou
sending forsaltafter drinking ourliquor, soImixed some salt in.""And that's
howyou've spoilt good liquor, youbooby," cried thecustomers, andwithabuse
they gotuponeafter another andflung outofthetavern. When thekeeper of
thetavern came home, anddidnotsee[252] asingle customer about, heasked
where theyhad allgot to.Sotheapprentice toldhimwhat hadhappened.
Rating him forhisfolly, themanwent oft'andtoldAnatha-pindika. Andthe
latter, thinking thestory agoodonetotell,repaired toJetavana, where afterdue
obeisance hetoldtheINIaster allabout it.
"This isnotthe firsttime, layman," saidtheMaster, "that thisapprentice
hasspoiled spirits. Hedidjust thesame once before." Then atAnatha-
pindika's request, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, tlie
Bodhisatta wastheTreasurer ofBenai'es, andhadatavern-keeper who
lived under hisprotection. Thisman having gotready asupply of
strong spirits, which helefthisapprentice^ tosellwhile hehimself went
offtobathe, during hisabsence hisapprentice mixed saltwith theliquor,
andspoiled itjust inthesame way.When onhisreturn theyoung man's
guide andmaster- came toknow what hadbeen done, hetold thestory
totheTreasurer.'Truly,' saidthelatter,'theignorant and foolish, with
every desire todogood, only succeed indoing harm.' And herecited
thisstanza :
'Tisknowledge crowns endeavour with success;
For fools arethwarted bytheir foolishness,—Witness Kondaiina's salted bowl ofgrog.
Inthese lines theBodhisatta taught thetruth.

Said theMaster, "Layman, thissame person spoiled spirits inthepast as
now." Then heshewed theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "He
whospoiled thespirits nowwas alsothespoiler ofthespirits inthose bygone
days,and Imyself wasthen theTreasurer ofBenares."

VEDABBHA-JATAKA.
''MisgvAded effort."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about aself-willed Brother. Said theMaster tothat Brother, "This isnotthe
first time. Brother, thatyouhave been self-willed
;youwere ofjust thesame
disposition inbygone tunes also [253];andtherefore itwas that, asyouwould
notfollow theadvice ofthewiseandgood,youcame tobecutintwobyasharp
sword andwere flung onthehighway ;andyouwere the S(jlecausewhya
thousand menmettheir end." A.ndsosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Oncf onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBeuares, there
wasabrahmin inavillage whoknew thecharm called Vedabbha. Now
thischarm, sothey say,was precious beyond allprice. For, ifata
certain conjunction oftheplanets thecharm wasrepeated andthegaze
bentupwards totheskies, straightway from theheavens there rained the
Seven Things ofPrice,—gold, silver, pearl, coral, catseye, ruby, and
diamond.
Inthose days theBodhisatta wasapupil ofthisbrahmin ;andone
day hismaster leftthe village onsome business orother, andcame
with theBodhisatta tothecountry ofCeti.
Inaforest bythewaydwelt fivehundred robbers—known as"theDe-
spatchei's"—whomade thewayimpassable. And these caught theBodhi-
satta andtheVedabbha-brahmin. (Why, you ask,were they called the
Despatchers'? —Well, thestory goes that ofevery two prisoners they
made they used todespatch one tofetch theransom ;and that'swhy
theywere called theDespatchers. Iftheycaptured afather andason,
they toldthefather togofortheransom tofree hisson ;iftheycaught a
mother andherdaughter, they sent themother forthemoney; ifthey
caught two bi'others, they lettheelder go ;and sotoo, ifthey caught
ateaclier and hispupil, itwas thepupil they setfree. Inthis case,
therefore, they kept theVedabbha-brahmin, andsent theBodhisatta for


122 TheJdtaka. Book I.
theransom.) And theBodhisatta saidwith abow tohismaster, "In
adayortwo Isliall surely come back]have nofear ;only failnotto
doasTshall say. To-day willcome topass theconjunction ofthe
planets which brings about therain oftheThings ofPrice. Take heed
lest, yielding tothismishap, you repeat thecharm and calldown the
precious shower. For, ifyou do,calamity will certainly befall bothyou
andthisband ofrobbers." With thiswarning tohismaster, theBodhi-
sattawent hisway inquest oftheransom.
Atsunset therobbers bound thebrahmin and laidhimbytheheels.
Just atthismoment the fullmoon roseover theeastern horizon, and
thebrahmin, studying theheavens, knew [254] thatthegreat conjunction
wastaking place. "Why," thought he,"should Isuffer thismisery?
Byrepeating thecharm Iwill calldown theprecious rain, paythe
robbers theransom, andgofree." Sohecalled out totherobbers,
"Friends, whydoyoutakemeaprisoner?" "To getaransom, reverend
sir," said they. "Well, ifthat isallyouwant," saidthebrahmin, "make
haste anduntieme;havemyhead bathed, andnew clothes putonme;
and letmebeperfumed anddecked with flowers. Then leavemeto
myself." Therobbers didashebade them. And thebrahmin, marking
theconjunction oftheplanets, repeated hischarm with eyes uplifted
totheheavens. Forthwith theThings ofPrice poinded down from the
skies !Therobbers picked them allup,wrapping their booty intobundles
with their cloaks. Then with their brethren theymarched away; and
thebrahmin followed intherear. But, asluckwould have it,theparty
wascaptured byasecond band offivehundred robbers! "Why doyou
seize us?" saidthe first tothesecond band. "For booty," wastheanswer.
"Ifbooty iswhat youwant, seizeonthatbrahmin, whobysimply gazing
upattheskies brought down riches asrain. Itwashewhogave usall
thatwehave got." Sothesecond band ofrobbers letthe firstband go,
and seized onthebrahmin, crying, "Give usriches too!" "Itwould
givemegreat pleasure," saidthebrahmin; "but itwillbeayear before
therequisite conjunction oftheplanets takes place again. Ifyou will
only besogood astowait tillthen, Iwillinvoke theprecious shower for
you."
"Rascally brahmin!" cried theangiy robbers, "youmade theother
band rich ofi"-hand, butwant xistowait awhole year !"Andthey cuthim
intwowith asharp sword, andflung hisbody inthemiddle oftheroad.
Then hurrying after the firstband ofI'obbers, they killed everyman of
them tooinhand-to-hand fight, andseized thebooty. Next, they divided
intotwocompanies andfought among themselves, company against com-
pany, tilltwohundred and fiftymenwere slain. And sotheywent on
killing oneanother, tillonlytwowere leftalive. Thus didthose thousand
mencome todestruction.

Now,when thetwo sui'vivors hadmanaged tocarry offthetreasure
they hid itinthejungle near avillage ;andoneofthem satthere, sword
inhand, [255] toguard it,whilst theother went intothevillage toget
riceandhave itcooked forsupper.
"Covetousness istheroot ofruin!" mused he'thatstopped bythe
treasure. "Wheiimymatecomes back, he'llwant halfofthis. Suppose
Ikillhimthemoment hegets back." Sohedrew hissword and sat
waiting forhiscomrade's return.
Meanwhile, theother hadequally reflected that thebooty had tobe
halved, andthought tohimself, "Suppose Ipoison the rice,andgive it
him toeatand sokillhim, andhave thewhole ofthetreasure to
myself." Accordingly, when thericewasboiled, hefirst atehisown share,
andthen put ])oison inthe rest, Avhich hecarried back withhimtothe
jungle. But scarce hadheset itdown, when the otlier robber cuthim
intwowith hissword, and hidthebodyaway inasecluded spot.
Then heatethepoisoned rice,and died thenand thei^e. Thus, by
reason ofthetreasure, notonly thebrahmin but alltherobbers came to
destruction.
Howbeit, after adayortwotheBodhisatta came backwith theransom.
Notfinding hismaster where hehad lefthim,butseeing treasure strewn
allround about, hisheart misgave him that, inspite ofhisadvice, his
master must have called down ashower oftreasure from theskies, and
that allmust have perished inconsequence;andheproceeded along the
road. Onhiswayhecame towhere hismaster's body laycloven intwain
upon theway. "Alas !"hecried, "heisdead tlu'ough notheeding my
warning." Then with gathered sticks hemade apyre andburnt his
master's body,making anoffering ofwild flowers. Further along theroad,
hecame upon thefivehundred "Despatchers," andfurther stillupon the
twohundred and fifty,andsoonbydegrees until atlasthecame towhere
layonlytwo corpses. Marking how ofthethousand allbuttwohad
perished, andfeeling surethattheremust betwosurvivors, andthatthese
could notrefrain from strife, hepressed ontoseewhere theyhadgone. So
onhewent tillhefound thepathbywhich with thetreasure theyhad
turned intothejungle;andthere hefound theheap ofbundles oftreasure,
andonerobber lying dead with hisrice-bowl overturned athis side.
Realising thewhole story ataglance, theBodhisatta sethimself tosearch
forthemissing man,andatlastfoimd hisbody inthesecret spotwhere it
hadbeen flung [256]."And thus," mused theBodhisatta, "through not
following mycounsel mymaster inhisself-will hasbeen themeans of
destroying nothimself onlybutathousand others also. Truly, they that

asmymaster." Andhei-epeated thisstanza:—
Misguided effort leads toloss, notgain;
Thieves killed Vedabbha andthemselves were slain.
Thus spake theBodhisatta, andhewentontosay,—"Andeven asmy
master's misguided andmisplaced effort incausing therain oftreasure
tofallfrom heaven wrought both hisowndeath andthedestruction of
others with him.even soshall every othermanwhobymistaken means
seeks tocompass hisown advantage, utterly perish andinvolve others in
hisdestruction." With these words didtheBodhisatta make theforest
ring ;and inthisstanza didhepreach theTruth, whilst theTree-fairies
shouted applause. Thetreasure hecontrived tocarry offtohisownhome,
where helived outhisterm oflifeintheexercise ofalmsgiving andother
good works. Andwhen hislifeclosed, hedeparted totheheaven hehad
won.
Said theMaster, "This isnotthe first time. Brother, youwere self-willed;
youwere self-willed inbygone times aswell ;andbyyour selfwill youcame
toutter destruction." His lesson ended, heidentified theBirth bysaying,
"The selfwilled Brother wastheVedabbha-brahmin ofthose days,and Imyself
hispupil."

thatthestars were notfavourable forthatday; that thenuptials ought notto
becelebrated thatday ;and that, ifthey were, great misfortune would come of
it.Andthecountry femily intheir fixith intheir ascetic didnotgoforthebride
thatday.Now thebride's friends inthetown hadmade alltheii- preparations
forcelebrating thenuptials, andwhen theysawthat theother side didnot
come, they said,"Itwastheywho fixed to-day, andyettheyhave notcome;
andwehavegone togreat expense about itall.Who arethese people, forsooth ?
Letusmarry thegirltosomeone else." Sotheyfound another bridegroom and
gave the girltohim inmarriage with allthefestivities theyhadalready pre-
pared.
Next daythecountry party came tofetch thebride. ButtheSavatthi
people rated them asfollows:—"You country folkareabad lot;youfixed the
dayyourselves, andthen insulted usbynotcoming. Wehave given themaiden
toanother." Thecountry party started aquarrel, butintheendwenthome the
waytheycame.
Now theBrethren came toknowhow tliatNaked-ascetic hadthwarted the
festivity, andtheybegan totalkthematter over intheHall ofTruth. Entering
theHall,andlearning onenquiry thesubject oftheir conversation, theMaster
said, "Brethren, this isnotthe firsttime that thissame ascetic hasthwarted
thefestivities ofthatfamily; outofpique withthem, hedidjustthesame thing
once befoi'e." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, some
townsfolk hadasked acountry-girl inmarriage and liadnamed tlieday.
Having already made thearrangement, they asked their family ascetic
whether the .starswere propitious fortheceremony onthatday. Piqued
attheir having fixed thedaytosuitthemselves without firsttaking counsel
with him, theascetic madeuphismind tothwart their marriage festivities
forthatday; [2.58] andaccordingly hemade answer that thestarswere
notfavourable forthat day,and that, ifthey persisted, grave misfortune
would betheresult. So,intheir faith intheascetic, they stayed athome!
When thecountry folkfound thatthetown party didnotcome, they said
among themselves, "Itwastheywho fixed themarriage forto-day, and
nowtheyhave notcome. Who arethey, forsooth 1"Andtheymarried
the gii'ltosomeone else.
Next daythetownsfolk came andasked forthegirl ;butthe}' ofthe

Asyoustopped away, wemarried hertosomeone else." "Butweasked
our ascetic, andhetold usthestarswere unfavourable. That's whywe
didnotcome yesterday. Give usthe girl." "You didn't come atthe

Whilst theywrangled thuswith oneanother, awisemanfrom thetown

theyhadconsulted their ascetic andthat their absence wasdue tothe

"Jthousand evil-doers."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJeta-

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasreborn inthewomb oftheQueen Consort. When hewas
born, hewasnamed Prince Brahmadatta onhisname-day. Bysixteen
years ofagehehadbeen welleducated atTakkasila, hadlearned theThree
Vedas byheart, andwasversed intheEighteen Branches ofKnowledge.
And hisfather madehimaViceroy.
Now inthose days theBenares folkweremuch given tofestivals to

carcasses. Thought thedestined Lord ofMercy tohimself, "Ledastray
bysuperstition, mennowwantonly sacrifice life;themultitude arefor
themost part given uptoirreligion :butwhen atmyfather's death I
succeed tomyinheritance, Iwill findmeans toendsuch destruction
oflife. Iwill devise some clever stratagem whereby the evil shall be
stopped without harming asinglehuman being." Inthismood theprince
onedaymounted hischariot anddrove outofthe city.Onthewayhe
sawacrowd gathered together ataholy banyan-tree, praying tothefairy
whohadbeen i-eboi-n inthat tree, togrant them sonsanddaughters,
honour andwealth, each according tohisheart's desire. Alighting from
hischariot theBodhisatta drew near tothetreeandbehaved asawor-
shipper sofarastomake offerings ofperfumes andflowers, sprinkling the
treewith water, andpacing reverently round itstrunk. Then mounting
hischariot again, hewent hiswayback intothecity.
Thenceforth theprince made likejourneys from time totime tothe
tree [260], andworshipped itlikeatrue believer in'gods.'
Induecourse, when hisfather died, theBodhisatta ruled inhisstead.
Shunning thefour evil courses, and practising thetenroyal virtues, he
ruled hispeople inrighteousness. Andnow that hisdesire hadcome to
passandhewas king, theBodhisatta sethimself tofulfil hisformer
resolve. Sohecalled together hisministers, thebrahmins, thegentry, and
theother orders ofthepeople, andasked theassembly whether theyknew
howhehadmade himself king. Butnomancould tell.
"Have youever seenmereverently worshipping abanyan-tree with
perfumes andthelike,andbowing down before if?"
"Sire,wehave," saidthey.
"Well, Iwasmaking avow ;andthevowwas that, ifever Ibecame
king, Iwould offer asacrifice tothat tree.Andnowthatbyhelp ofthe
god Ihave come tobeking, Iwill offermypromised sacrifice. So
prepare itwith allspeed."
"But what arewetomake itof1"
"Myvow," saidtheking, "was this:—Allsuch asareaddicted tothe
Five Sins, towittheslaughter ofliving creatures andsoforth, and allsuch
aswalk intheTenPaths ofUnrighteousness, them willIslay,andwith

Obedient totlieking's commands, theministers hadproclamation made
bybeat ofdrum accordingly throughout thelength andbreadth ofBenares.
Such wasthe effect oftheproclamation onthetownsfolk thatnotasoul
persisted intheoldwickedness. And throughout theBodliisatta's reign
notamanwasconvicted oftransgressing. Thus, without harming asingle
oneofhissubjects, theBodhisatta madethem observe theCommandments.
And attheclose ofalifeofalms-giving andother goodworks hepassed

andateachhedistributed ahiis topoor travellers andtheneedy. Hekept
theCommandments andobserved thefast-days ;heabounded inpatience,
loving-kindness, andmercy ;and inrighteousness heruled theland,
cherishing allcreatures alike with thefond love ofafather forhisbaby
boy.
Now oneoftheking's ministers haddealt treacherously intheking's
harem, and thisbecame matter ofcommon talk. Theministers reported it
totheking. Examining into thematter himself, theking found the
minister's guilt tobeclear. Sohesent forthe culprit, and said,"O
blinded byfolly !youhave sinned, andarenotworthy todwell inmy
kingdom;takeyour substance andyour v/ifeandfamily, andgohence."
Driven thus from therealm, that minister lefttheKasi country, and,
entering theservice oftheking ofKosala, gradually rose tobethat
monarch's confidential adviser. Onedayhesaid totheking ofKosala,
"Sire, thekingdom ofBenares islikeagoodly honeycomb untainted by
flies ;itsking isfeebleness itself ;and atrifling force would suflice to
conquer thewhole country."
Hereon, theking ofKosala reflected that thekingdom ofBenares was
large, and, considering this inconnexion with theadvice that atrifling
force could conquer it,hegi-ew suspicious that hisadviser wasahireling
suborned toleadhim into atrap. "Traitor," hecried, "youarepaid to
saythis!"
"Indeed Iamnot," answered theother; "Idobutspeak thetruth.
Ifyoudoubt me,sendmen tomassacre avillage over hisborder, andsee
whether, when they arecaught andbrought before him, theking doesnot
letthem oS"scot-free andeven loadthem with gifts."
"Heshows avery bold front inmaking hisassertion," thought the
king ;"Iwill test hiscounsel [2G.3] without delay." And accordingly
hesentsome ofhiscreatures toharry avillage across theBenares border.
The ruffians were captured andbrought before theking ofBenares, who
asked them, saying,"My children, whyhaveyoukilledmyvillagers?"
"Because wecould notmake aliving," saidthey.
"Then whydidyounotcome tomel" saidtheking. "See thatyou
donotdothelikeagain."
And hegavethem presents andsentthem away. Back theywent
andtold thistotheking ofKosala. But thisevidence wasnotenough to
nerve him totheexpedition ;andasecond band wassent tomassacre
another village, thistime intheheart ofthekingdom. These toowere
likewise sentaway with presents bytheking ofBenares. Buteven this
evidence wasnotdeemed strong enough ;andathird party wassent to
plunder thevery streets ofBenares !And these, like their forerunners,

were sentaway with presents !Satisfied atlastthat theking ofBenares
wasanentirely good king, theking ofKosala resolved toseize onhis
kingdom, andsetoutagainst himwith troops andelephants.
Now inthese days theking ofBenares hadathousand gallant warriors,
whowould facethecharge even ofarutelephant,—whom thelaunched
thunderbolt ofIndra could not terrify,—amatchless band ofinvincible
heroes ready attheking's command toreduce allIndia tohissway !
These, hearing theking ofKosala wascoming totake Benares, came to
their sovereign with thenews, andprayed thattheymight bedespatched
against theinvader, "We willdefeat andcapture him, sire," saidthey,
"before hecansetfootovertheborder."
"Not so,mychildren," saidtheking. "None shall suffer because of
me. Letthosewho covet kingdoms seize mine, ifthey will." Andhe
refused toallow them tomarch against theinvader.
Then theking ofKosala- crossed theborder andcame tothemiddle-
country;andagain theministers went tothekingwithrenewed entreaty.
But stilltheking refused. Andnowtheking ofKosala appeared outside
thecity,andsentamessage totheking bidding him either yield upthe
kingdom orgive battle. "Ifight not," wasthemessage oftheking of
Benares inreply;"lethim seizemykingdom."
Yet athird time theking's ministers came tohimandbesought him
nottoallow theking ofKosala toenter, buttopermit them tooverthrow
andcapture himbefore the city. Still refusing, thekingbade thecity-
gates beopened, [264] and seated himself instate aloftupon hisroyal
throne with histhousand ministei-s round him.
Entering thecityandfinding none tobarhisway, theking ofKosala
passed with hisarmy totheroyal })alace. The dooi's stood openwide ;and
there onhisgorgeous throne with histhousand ministers around himsate
thegreatKing Goodness instate. "Seize them all," cried theking of
Kosala ;"tietheir hands tightly behind their backs, andaway withthem
tothecemetery !There digholes andburythem aliveuptotheneck, so
thattheycannot movehand orfoot. Thejackals willcome atnight and
givethem sepulchre !"
Atthel)idding ofthernfiianly king, hisfollowers bound theking of
Benares and hisministers, andhauled them off.Buteven inthishour
notsomuch asanangry thought didthegreat King Goodness harbour
against therufiians ;andnotamanamong hisministers, evenwhen they

Goodness exhorted hiscompanions, saying, "Letyour hearts befilled with
naught butloveandcharity, mychildren."
Now atmidnight thejackals came trooping tothebanquet ofhuman
flesh ;and atsight ofthebeasts thekingand hiscompanions raised a
mighty shout alltogether, frightening thejackals away. Halting, the
pack looked back, and, seeing noonepursuing, again came forward, A
second shout drove themaway again, butonly toreturn asbefore. But
thethird time, seeing thatnotamanamongst them allpursued, thejackals
thought tothemselves, "These must bemenwho aredoomed todeath."
Theycame onboldly ;evenwhen theshout wasagain being raised, they
didnotturn tail.Onthey came, each singling outhisprey,—thechief
jackal making fortheking, andtheother jackals forhiscompanions [265].
Fertile inresource, thekingmarked thebeast's approach, and, raising his
throat asiftoreceive the bite, fastened histeeth inthejackal's throat
with agrip likeavice !Unable tofree itsthroat from themighty grip of
theking's jaws, andfearing death, thejackal raised agi'eat howl. Athis
cryofdistress thepack conceived that their leader must havebeencaught
byaman. With noheart lefttoapproach theirowndestined prey,away
they allscampered fortheir lives.
Seeking tofree itself from theking's teeth, thetrapped jackal plunged
madly toand fro,andthereby loosened theearth above theking. Here-
upon the latter, letting thejackal go,putforth hismighty strength, and
byplunging from side tosidegothishands free !Then, clutching the
brink ofthe i)it,hedrew himself up,andcame forth likeacloud scudding
before thewind. Bidding hiscompanions beofgood cheer, henow setto
work toloosen theearth round them andtogetthem out, tillwith allhis
ministers hestood fi'eeoncemore inthecemetery.
Now itchanced that acoi'pse hadbeen exposed inthat part ofthe
cemetery which laybetween therespective domains oftwoogres ;andthe
ogres were disputing over thedivision ofthespoil.
"Wecan't divide itourselves," saidthey ;"but thisKing Goodness is
righteous; hewilldivide itfor lis.Letusgotohim." Sotheydragged
thecorp.se bythefoot totheking, and said, "Sire, divide thismanand
give useach ourshare." "Certainly Iwill,myfriends," saidtheking.
"But, asIamdirty, Imust bathe first."
Straightway, bytheir magic i)ower, theogres brought totheking the
scented water prepared fortheusurpei-'s bath. Andwhen thekinghad
bathed, they brought him therobes which hadbeen laidout forthe
usurper towear. When hehadputthese on,they brought hismajesty

they brought flowers ofdivers kinds laidoutupon jewelled fans, ina

andreturned with riceflavoured with allthechoicest flavours, which had
been prepared fortheusurper's table. And theking,nowbathed and
scented, dressed andarrayed, ateofthedainty fare. Thereupon theogres
brought theusurper's perfumed water forhim todrink, intheusurper's
owngolden bowl, notforgetting tobring thegolden cuptoo.When the
kinghaddrunk andhadwashed hismouth andwaswashing hishands,
they bi'ought himfragrant betel tochew, andasked whether hismajesty
hadanyfurther commands.''Fetch me," said he,"byyour magic power
thesword ofstatewhich liesbytheusurper's pillow." And straightway
thesword wasbrought totheking. Then theking took thecorpse, and
setting itupright, cut itintwodown thechine, giving one-half toeach
ogre. This done, thekingwashed theblade, andgirded itonhisside.
Having eaten their fill,theogres were glad ofheart, and intheir
gratitude asked thekingwhatmore they could doforhim. "Setmeby
yourmagic power," said he,"intheusurj)er's chamber, andseteach ofmy
ministers back inhisownhouse." "Certainly, sire," snidtheogres ;and
forthwith itwasdone. Now inthathour theusurper waslying asleep on
theroyal bedinhischamber ofstate. And asheslept inalltranquillity,
thegood king struck himwith the flatofthesword upon the belly.
Waking upinafright, theusurper sawbythelamp-light that itwasthe
greatKing Goodness. Summoning upallhiscourage, herosefrom his
couch andsaid:—"Sire, itisnight; aguard isset;thedoors arebarred;
andnonemay enter. How thencame youtomybedside, sword inhand
and clad inrobes ofsplendour?" Then theking toldhim indetail all
thestory ofhisescape. Then theusurper's heartwasmoved within him,
andhecried, "Oking, I,though blessed withhuman nature, knew not
yourgoodness ;butknowledge thereof wasgiven tothe fierce and cruel
ogres, whose food isfleshandblood. Henceforth, I,sire, [267] willnot
plot against such signal virtue asyou possess." Sosaying, heswore an
oath offi'iendship upon hissword andbegged theking's forgiveness. And
hemade theking liedown upon thebedofstate, while hestretched
himself upon alittle couch.
Onthemorrow atdaybreak, when thesunhad risen, hiswhole host
ofevery rank anddegree wasmustered bybeat ofdrum attheusurper's
command ;intheir presence heextolled King Goodness, asifraising the
full-moon onhigh intheheavens ;andright before them all,heagain
asked theking's forgiveness andgavehim back hiskingdom, saying,
"Henceforth, let itbemycharge todeal with rebels ;rulethou thy

byperseverance that Irecovered theroyal state Ihad lost,andsaved the

And therewithal thekingbroke into this heai-tfelt utterance :—
Toil on,mybrother ;still inhope stand fast;
Nor letthycourage flagand tire.

"What^ Leave ^mtasted.''^ —Thia story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about some drugged liquor.
Onceonatime the ti})i)lers ofSavatthi met totake counsel, saying, "We've
notgottheprice ofadrink left ;howarewetogetit?"
"Cheer up!" saidoneruffian; "I've alittle plan."
"What maythatbe?" cried theothers.
"It's Anatha-pindika's custom," said the fellow, "towear hisrings and
richest attire, when going towaitupon theking. Letusdoctor some liquor
withastupefying drugand fitupadi-inking-booth, inwhichwewill allbesitting
when Anatha-pindika passes by.'Come and join us.LordHigh Treasurer,'
we'll cry,andplyhimwith ourliquor tillheloses hissenses. Then letus
relieve himofhisringsandclothes, andgettheprice ofadrink."
Hisplan mightily pleased theother rogues, andwasduly carried out.As
Anatha-pindika wasreturning, theywent outtomeethimandinvited him[269]
tocome along withthem ;fortheyhadgotsome rare liquor, andhemust taste
itbefore hewent.
"WhatT' thought he,"shall abeliever, wliohasfound Salvation, touch
strong drink ?Howbeit, though Ihavenocraving for it,yetwill Iexpose these
rogues." Sointotheir booth hewent, where their proceedings soonshewed him
that their liquor wasdrugged;andheresolved tomake therascals take totheir
heels. Soheroundly charged them with doctoring their liquor with aview to
drugging strangers firstandrobbing them afterwards. "You sitinthebooth
youhave opened, andyoupraise uptheliquor," saidhe;"but asfordrinking
it,notoneofyouventures onthat. Ifitisreally undrugged, drink away at
ityourselves." Thissunnnary exposure made thegang take totheir heels, and
Anatha-pindika went offhome. Thinking hemight aswell telltheincident to
theBuddha, hewent toJetavana andrelated thestory.
"This time, layman," saidtheMaster, "it isyouwhom these rogues have
tried totrick ;sotoointhepastthey tiied totrick thegoodandwise ofthose
days." Sosaying, athishearer's request, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasTreasurer ofthat city.And then toodidthesamegang
oftipplers, conspiring together inlikemanner, drug liquor, andgofortli
tomeethim injust thesame way, andmade just thesame overtures.
TheTreasurer didnotwant todrink atall,butnevertheless went with
them, solely toexpose them. Marking theii* proceedings anddetecting
their scheme, hewasanxious toscarethemaway and sorepresented that
itwould beagross thing forhim todrink spirits just before going tothe
king's palace. "Sityouhere," said he,"till I'veseen thekingandam
onmywayback;then I'llthink about it."
Onhisreturn, therascals called tohim,buttheTreasurer, fixing his

Nay, this isproof nohonest liquors there. [270]
After alifeofgood deeds, theBodliisatta passed away tofareaccording

"IVken nearavillage."—Tliiswas toldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about alaybrother whowas skilled intheknowledge offruits. Itai)pears that
acertain squire ofSavattlii hadinvited theBi'otherhood with theBuddha at
their head, andhadseated them inhispleasaunce, where theywere regaled with
rice-gruel and cakes. Afterwards hebade hisgardener goround with the
Brethren andgivemangoes andother kinds offruits totheir Reverences. In
obedience toorders, themanwalked about thegrounds with theBrethren, and
could tellbyasingle glance upatthetreewhat fruitwasgreen, what nearly
ripe,andwhat quite ripe,andsoon.Andwhat hesaidwasalways found true.
SotheBrethren came totheBuddha andmentioned howexpert thegardener
was,andhow, whilst himself standing ontheground, hecould accurately tellthe
condition ofthehanging fruit. "Brethren," saidtheMaster, "this gardener is
nottheonlyonewhohashadknowledge offruits. Alikeknowledge wasshewn
bythewiseandgood offormer days also." And sosaying, hetold tliisstory of
thepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahniadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta wasborn amerchant. When hegrew up,andwastrading
with fivehundred waggons, hecame oneday towhere theroad led
through agreat forest. [271] Halting attheoutskirts, hemustered the
caravan and addressed them thus:—-"Poison-trees grow inthis forest.
Take heed thatyoutaste nounfamiliar leaf, flower, orfruit without first
consulting me." Allpromised totake every care ;andthejourney into


136 TheJataka. Book I.
theforest began. Now justwithin theforest-border stands avillage, and
just outside that village grows aWhat-fruit tree. TheWhat-fruit tree
exactly resembles amango alike intrunk, branch, leaf, flower, and fruit.
And notonly inoutward semblance, but also intaste and smell, the
fruit—ripeorunripe—mimics themango. Ifeaten, itisadeadly poison,
andcauses instant death.
Nowsome greedy fellows, whowent onahead ofthecaravan, came to
thistreeand, taking ittobeamango, ateofitsfruit. Butothers said,
"Let usaskourleader before weeat"; andthey accordingly halted by
thetree, fruit inhand, tillhecame up. Perceiving that itwasnomango,
hesaid:—"This'mango'isaWhat-fruit tree;don't touch itsfruit."
Having stopped them from eating, theBodhisatta turned hisattention
tothosewhohadalready eaten. First hedosed them with anemeti(;,
andthen hegavethem thefoursweet foods toeat ;sothat intheend
they recovered.
Nowonformer occasions caravans hadhalted beneath thissame tree,
andhaddied from eating thepoisonous fruit which they mistook for
mangoes. Onthemorrow the villagers woukl come, andseeing them
lying there dead, would flingthem bythe heels intoasecret place,
departing with allthebelongings ofthecaravan, waggons and all.
Andonthedaytooofourstory these villagers failed nottohurry at
daybreak tothetree fortheir expected spoils. "Theoxenmust beours,"
saidsome. "And we'll have thewaggons," sai<l others;—whilst others
again claimed thewares astheir share. Butwhen theycame breathless
tothetree, there wasthewhole cai-avan aliveandwell!
"Howcame you toknow thiswasnotamango-tree 1"demanded the
disappointed villagers. "We didn't know," saidthey ofthecaravan; "it
wasourleader whoknew."
80thevillagers came totheBodhisatta and said, "Man ofwisdom,
what didyoudotofindoutthistreewasnotamango 1"
"Two things toldme," replied theBodhisatta, andherepeated this
stanza:—[272]
When near avillage grows atree
Nothard toclimb, 'tisplain tome.
Norneed Ifurther proof toknow,—Nowholesome fruit thereon cangrow!
Andhaving taught theTruth totheassembled multitude, hefinished
hisjourney insafety.
"Thus, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "inbygone days thewiseandgoodwere
experts infruit." Hislesson ended, heshewed theconnexion and identified the
Birth bysaying, "The Buddha,'s followers were then thepeople ofthecaravan,
and Imyself wasthecaravan leader."

"When noAttachment" —This story wastold l>ytheMaster while atJeta-

SaidtheMaster tohim, "Isthereport true, Brother, that 3'ouareaback-
slider?"
"Yes, Blessed One."
"Inbygone days, Brother," saidtheMaster, "thewiseandgoodwonathrone
bytheir dauntless perseverance inthehour ofneed."
And sosaying, hetold this stoi-y ofthepast.
Once onatime wlien Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, itwasas
his(jueen's child thattheBodhisatta came tolifeonce more. Ontheday
when hewastobenamed, thejiarents enquired astotheir child's destiny
from eight hundred brahmins, towhom tlieygave their hearts' desire iu
allpleasures ofsense. INtarking thepromise which heshewed ofa
glorious destiny, these clever soothsaying brahmins foretold that,coming
tothethrone attheking's death, thechild should beamighty king
endowed with every virtue ;famed andrenowned forhisexploits with
fiveweapons, heshould stand peerless inallJambudipa'. [273]And
because ofthisprophecy ofthebrahmins, theparents named their son
Prince Five-Weapons.
Now, when theprince wascome toyears ofdiscretion, andwas
sixteen years old,thekingbadehimgoaway andstudy,
"With whom, sire,amItostudy?" asked theprince.
"With theworld-famed teacher inthetown ofTakkasila inthe
Gandhara country. Here ishisfee," said theking, handing hissona
thousand pieces.
Sotheprince went toTakkasila andwastaught there. When hewas
leaving, hismaster gavehimasetoffiveweapons, armed with which,
after Itidding adieu tohisoldmaster, theprince setoutfrom Takkasila for
Benares.
Onhiswayhecame toaforest haunted byanogrenamed Hairy -grip;
and, attheentrance totheforest, menwhomethim tried tostop him,
saying:—"Young brahmin, donotgothrough that forest; itisthehaunt

oftheogre Hairy-grip, andhekillsevery onehemeets." But,bold asa
lion, theself-reliant Bodhisatta pressed on, tillintheheart oftheforest he
came ontheogre. Themonster made himself appear instature astallas
apalm-tree, with ahead asbigasanarbour andhuge eyes likebowls,
withtwotusks liketurnips andthebeak ofahawk ;hisbellywasblotched
with purple ;andthepalms ofhishands andthesoles ofhisfeetwere
blue-black! "Whither away?" cried themonster. "Halt! youaremy
prey.""Ogre," answered theBodhisatta, "Iknew what Iwasdoing
when entering this forest. You willbeill-advised tocome near me. For
with apoisoned arrow Iwill slayyouwhere youstand." And with this
defiance, hefitted tohisbowanarrow dipped indeadliest poison andshot
itattheogre. But itonlystuck ontothemonster's shaggy coat. Then he
shotanother andanother, till fiftywere spent, allofwhich merely stuck
ontotheogre's shaggy coat. Hereon theogre, shaking thearrows off'so
that they fellathisfeet,came attheBodhisatta ;andthe latter, again
shouting defiance, drew hissword andstruck attheogre. But, likethe
arrows, hissword, which wasthirty-three inches long, merely stuck fastin
theshaggy hair. Next theBodhisatta hurled hisspear, andthat stuck
fast also. Seeing this, hesmote theogrewith hisclub ;but, like his
other weapons, that toostuck fast. And thereupon theBodhisatta
shouted, "Ogre, younever heard yetofme,[274] Prince Five-Weapons.
When Iventured into this forest, Iputmytrust notinmybowandother
weapons, butinmyself !Now willIstrike youablowwhich shall crush
youintodust." Sosaying, theBodhisatta smote theogre with hisright
hand ;butthehand stuck fastupon the hair. Then, inturn, with his
lefthandandwith hisright and left feet,hestruck atthemonster, but
handandfeetalike clave tothehide. Again shouting "Iwillcrush you
intodust!"hebutted theogrewith hishead, andthattoostuck fast.
Yetevenwhen thuscaught andsnared infivefold wise, theBodhisatta,
ashehung upon theogre, was still fearless, stillundaunted. And the
monster thought tohimself, "This isavery lionamong men, ahero
without apeer,andnomere man. Though heiscaught intheclutches of
anogre likeme,yetnotsomuch asatremor willheexhibit. Never,
since Ifirsttook toslaying travellers upon this road, have Iseen aman
toequal him.How coines itthatheisnotfrightened?"Notdaring to
devour theBodhisatta offliand, hesaid, "How isit,young brahmin, that
youhavenofearofdeath ?"
"Why should I?"answered theBodhisatta. "Each lifemust surely
have itsdestined death. Moreover, within mybody isasword of
adamant, which youwillnever digest, ifyou eatme. Itwillchopyour
inwards intomincemeat, andmydeath willinvolve yours too. Therefore
itisthat 1have nofear." (By this, itissaid, theBodhisatta meant
theSword ofKnowledge, which waswithin him.)

Hereon, theogre fella-thinking. "Thisyoung brahmin isspeaking
thetx'uth andnothing butthetruth," thought he."Not amorsel sobig
asapeacould Idigest ofsuch ahero. I'lllethimgo."And so,infear
ofhis life,helettheBodhisatta gofree, saying, "Young brahmin, youare
alionamong men ;Iwillnoteatyou.Goforth frommyhand, even as
themoon from thejaws ofRahu, andreturn togladden thehearts of
your kinsfolk, your friends, andyour country."
"Asformyself, ogi'e," answered theBodhisatta, "Iwill go.Asfor
you, itwasyour sins inbygone days thatcaused you tobereborn a
ravening, murderous, flesh-eating ogre ;and, if[275] youcontinue insin

Inthisandother ways theBodhisatta shewed theevilconsequences of
thefivebadcourses, andtheblessing thatcomes ofthefivegood courses;
andsowrought indivers ways u})on that ogre's fears thatbyhisteaching
heconverted themonster, imbuing himwith self-denial andestablishing
him intheFiveCommandments. Thenmaking theogrethefairy ofthat
forest, with aright tolevy dues', and chai'ging him toremain stedfast,
theBodhisatta Aveiit hisway, making known thechange intheogre's
mood asheissued from theforest. And intheendhecame, armed with
thefiveweapons, tothecityofBenares, andpresented himself before his
parents. Inlater days,when king, hewasarigliteous ruler ;and after a
lifespent inchai'ity andother goodworks hepassed away tofare there-
after accoidinir tohisdeserts.
This lesson ended, theMaster, asBuddha, recited thisstanza:—

When hehadthus ledhisteaching uptoArahatship asitscrowning point,
theMaster wentontopreach theFour Truths, attheclosewhereof thatBrother

"When gladness.''^—This story was toldbytheMaster while atSavatthi,
about acertain Brother. Tradition says that through hearing theMaster
preach ayoung gentleman ofSavatthi gave hisheart totheprecious Faithiand
became aBrother. Histeachers andmasters proceeded toinstruct him inthe
whole oftheTenPrecepts ofMorality, oneafter theother, expounded tohimthe
Short, theMedium, andtheLong Moralities-, setforth the^Morality which rests
onself-restraint according tothePatimokkha', theMorality which restsonself-
restraint astotheSenses, theMorality which rests onablameless walk
of life, theMorality which relates tothewtiy aBrother may usethe
Requisites. Thought theyoung beginner, "There isatremendous lotofthis
Morality ;and Ishall undoubtedly failtofulfil allIhavevowed. Yetwhat is
thegood ofbeing abrother atall, ifonecannot keep therules ofMorality 1My
be.stcourse istogoback totheworld, takeawifeandrearchildren, living alife
ofalmsgiving andother good works." Sohetoldhissuperiors what hethought,
saying thatheproposed toreturn tothelower state ofalayman, andwished to
hand back hisbowlandrobes. "Well, ifitbesowith you," saidthey,"atleast
take leave oftheBuddha before yougo;" andthey brought theyoung man
before theMaster intheHall ofTruth.
"AVhy, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "areyoubringing thisBrother tome
against hiswill?"
"Sir, hesaid that Morality wasmore than hecould observe, andwanted
togiveback hisrobes andbowl. Sowetookhimandbrought him toyou."
"But why, Brethren," asked theMaster, "didyouburthen himwith so
much \Hecandowhat hecan,butnomore. Donotmake thismistake again,
andleavemetodecide what should bedone inthecase."
Then, turning totheyoung Brother, theMaster said,"Come, Brother; what
concern haveyouwith Morality inthemass? Doyouthink youcould obey
justthree moral rules?"
"Oh, yes. Sir."
"Well now,watch andguard thethree avenues ofthevoice, themind, and
thebody ;donoevilwhether inword, orthought, oract. Cease nottobea
Brother, butgohence andobey justthese three rules."
"Yes, indeed. Sir, Iwillkeepthem," hereexclaimed thegladyoung man,and
back hewent with histeachers again. And ashewaskeeping histhree rules,
hethought within himself, "Ihadthewhole ofMorality tokimebymy in-
structors;butbecause theywerenottheBuddha, they could notmakemegrasp
even this nuich. Whereas [277] theAll-Enlightened One,byi-eason ofhis

hewonInsight andinafewdays attained Arahatship. When thiscame tothe
earsoftheBrethren, theyspoke ofitwhen mettogether intheHall ofTruth,
telling howtheBrother, whowasgoing back totheworld because hecould not
hope tofulfil Morality, hadbeen furnished bytheMaster with three rules
embodying thewhole of]\Iorality, andhadbeenmade tograsp those three rules,
andsohadbeen enabled bytheMaster towinArahatship. How marvellous,
they cried, wastheBuddha.
Entering theHall atthis point, andlearning onenquiry thesubject oftheir
talk, theMaster said, "Brethren, even aheavy burthen becomes light, iftaken
piecemeal ;andthus thewiseandgood ofpast times, onfinding ahugemass of
gold tooheavy tolift, firstbroke itupandthen were enabled tobear their
treasure away piece bypiece." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasafarmer inavillage, andwasploughing one
dayinafieldwhere once stood avillage. Now, inbygone days, awealthy
merchant haddiedleaving buried inthis field ahuge barofgold, asthick
round asaman's thigh, andfourwhole cubits inlength. And fullonthis
barstruck theBodhisatta's plough, and thei'e stuck fast. Taking ittobe
aspreading root ofatree,hedug itout ;butdiscovering itsrealnature,
hesettowork toclean thedirt offthegold. The day'swork done, at
sunset helaid aside liisplough and gear, andessayed toshoulder his
treasure-trove andwalk ofi'with it.But, ashecould notsomuch aslift
it,hesatdown before itand fella-thinking what useshewould put itto.
"I'll have somuch tolive on,somuch tobury asatreasure, somuch
totrade witli, and somuch forcharity andgood works," thought heto
himself, and accordingly cutthegold into four. Division made his
burthen easy tocarry ;andheborehome thelumps ofgold. After a
lifeofcharity andother good works, hepassed away tofare thereafter
accordinor tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster, asBuddha, recited thisstanza:—[278]
When gladness fillstheheart and fillsthemind,
When righteousness ispractised Peace towin.
Hewho sowalks shall gain thevictory
And alltheFetters utterly destroy.
Andwhen theMaster hadthus ledhisteaching uptoArahatship asits
crowning point, heshewed theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying,
"Inthose days Imyself wasthemanwhogotthenugget ofgold."

Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta's going about tokillhim. Being informed of
Devadatta's mm-derous intent, theMaster said, "This isnotthe first time.
Brethren, thatDevadatta hasgone about seeking tokillme;hedidjustthe
same inbygone days, butfailed towork hiswicked will." And sosaying, he
toldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asamonkey. When full-grown, hewas
asbigasamare's foalandenormously strong. Helived alone onthe
banks ofariver, inthemiddle ofwhich wasanisland whei'eon grew
mangoes andbread-fruits, andother fruit-trees. And inmid-stream, half-
waybetween theisland andtheriver-bank, asolitaiy rock roseoutofthe
watei'. Being asstrong asanelephant, theBodhisatta used toleapfrom
thebankontothisrockandthence ontotheisland. Here hewould eat
his fillofthefruits thatgrew ontheisland, returning atevening bythe
wayhecame. Andsuchwashislifefromday today.
Now there lived inthose days inthat river acrocodile and liis
mate;and she,being withyoung, wasledbythesight oftheBodhisatta
journeying toand frotoconceive [279] alonging forthemonkey's
heart toeat. Soshebegged her lord tocatch themonkey forher.
Promising that sheshould have her f;incy, thecrocodile went offand
took hisstand ontherock,meaning tocatch themonkey onhisevening
journey home.
After ranging about theisland allday, theBodhisatta looked outat
evening towards therockandwondered why therock stood sohigh out
ofthewater. Forthestory goes that theBodhisatta always marked the
exact height ofthewater intheriver, andoftherock inthewater. So,
when hesaw that, though thewater stood atthesame level, therock
seemed tostand higher outofthewater, hesuspected thatacrocodile
might belurking there tocatch him. And, inorder tofindoutthefacts
ofthe case, heshouted, asthough addressing therock, "Hi! rock!"
And, asnoreply came back, heshouted three times, "Hi! rock!" And


No. 57. 143
astherock stillkept silence, themonkey called out,"How comes it,
friend rock, thatyouwon't answer meto-day?"
"Oh!" thought thecrocodile; "sotherock's inthehabit ofanswering
themonkey. Imust answer fortherock to-day." Accordingly, he
shouted, "Yes, monkey; what isit?""Who areyou?" saidtheBodhi-
satta. "I'm acrocodile." "What areyou sitting onthat rock for?"
"Tocatch youandeatyour heart." Astherewasnootherwayback, the
only thing tobedonewas tooutwit thecrocodile. SotheBodhisatta
cried out,"There's nohelp foritthenbuttogivemyself uptoyou.Open
yourmouth andcatchmewhen Ijump."
Now youmustknow thatwhen crocodiles open their mouths, their
eyes shut'. So,when this crocodile unsuspiciously opened hismouth, his
eyes shut. And there hewaited with closed eyesandopenjaws !Seeing
this,thewilymonkey made ajump ontothecrocodile's head, andthence,
with aspring like liglitning, gained thebank. When thecleverness of
this featdawned onthe crocodile, hesaid,"Monkey, hethat inthis
world [280] possesses thefour virtues overcomes hisfoes.And you,me-
thinks, possess allfour." And, sosaying, herepeated thisstanza:—
Whoso, monkey-king, likeyou,combines
Truth, foresight, fixed resolve, and fearlessness.
Shall seehisrouted foemen turnand flee.
And with this praise oftheBodhisatta, the ci'ocodile betook himself to
hisown dwelling-place.
SaidtheMaster, "This isnotthefirsttime then, Bretliren, thatDevadatta has
goneabout seeking tokillme;hedidjustthesame inbygone days too." And,
having ended hislesson, theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified the
Birth bysaying, "Devadiitta wasthecrocodile ofthose days, tliebrahmin-girl
Cinca^ wasthecrocodile's wife,and Imyself theMonkey-King."

"Whoso, likeyou."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while attlieBamboo-
grove alsoupon thesubject ofgoing about tokill.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, Devadatta
came tolifeagain asamonkey, anddwelt near theHimalayas asthe
lord ofatribe ofmonkeys allofhisown begetting. Filled with fore-
bodings that hismale offspring might grow uptoousthimfrom his
lordship, heused togeld[281] them allwith histeeth. Now theBodhi-
sattahadbeen begotten bythissamemonkey ;and hismother, inorder
tosave herunborn progeny, stoleaway toaforest atthefoot ofthe
mountain, where indueseason shegave birth totheBodhisatta. And
when hewasfull-grown andhadcome toyears ofunderstanding, hewas
gifted withmarvellous strength.
"Where ismyfather'?" saidheonedaytohismother. "He dwells
atthefootofacertain mountain, myson," shereplied; "and isking
ofatribe ofmonkeys." "Takemetoseehim,mother." "Not so,my
son ;foryour father issoafraid ofbeing supplanted byhissons that
hegeldsthem allwith histeeth." "Never mind; takemethere, mother,"
.saidtheBodhisatta; "Ishallknow what todo." Soshetookhimwith
hertotheoldmonkey. Atsight ofhisson,theoldmonkey, feeling sure
that theBodhisatta would growuptodepose him, resolved byafeigned
embrace tocrush the lifeoutoftheBodhisatta. "Ah!myboy!" he
cried; "where haveyoubeen allthislong time*?" And,making ashow
ofembracing theBodhisatta, hehugged him like avice. But the
Bodhisatta, whowas asstrong asanelephant, returned thehug so
mightily that hisfather's ribswere liketobreak.
Then thought theoldmonkey, "Thissonofmine, ifhegrows up,will
certainly killme." Casting about how tokilltheBodhisatta first, he
bethought himofacertain lakehard by,where anogre livedwhomight
eathim. Sohesaid totheBodhisatta, "I'm oldnow,myboy,andshould
liketohand over thetribe toyou ;to-day you shallbemade king. Ina

fivekinds ofwhite-lotus. Goandpickmesome." "Yes, father," answei'ed

theBodhisatta;aud otfhestarted. Approaching thelakewith caution,
hestudied thefootprints onitsbanks andmarked how allofthem led
doivn tothewater, butnone evercame back. Realising thatthelakewas
haunted byanogre, hedivined that hisfather, being unable himself tokill
him,wished togethimkilled [282] bytheogre. "But I'llgetthelotuses,"
said he,"without going into thewater atall." Sohewent toadry
spot,andtaking arunleaped from thebank. Inhisjump, ashewas
clearing thewater, heplucked two flowers which grew upabove the
surface ofthewater, andalighted withthem ontheopposite bank. On
hiswayback, heplucked twomore inlikemanner, ashejumped;and
somade aheap onboth sides ofthelake,—butalways keeping outof
theogre's watery domain. When hehadpicked asmany ashethought
hecould carry across, andwasgathering together those ononebank,
theastonished ogre exclaimed, "I've lived alongtime inthis lake, but
Inever saweven ahuman being sowonderfully clever !Here isthis
monkey whohaspicked alltheflowers hewants, andyethaskept safely
outofrange ofmyjjower." And, parting thewaters asunder, theogre
came upoutofthelake towhere theBodhisatta stood, andaddressed
him thus,"0king ofthemonkeys, hethathasthree qualities shallhave
themastery over hisenemies ;andyou,methinks, have allthree." And,
sosaying, herepeated thisstanza intheBodhisatta's praise:—
Whoso, likeyou, monkey-king, combines
Dexterity andValour andResource,
Shall seehisrouted foemen turnand flee.
Hispraises ended, theogreasked theBodhisatta whyhewasgathering
theflowers.
"My father isminded tomakemeking ofhistribe," saidtheBodhi-
satta, "and that iswhy Iamgathering them."
"But one .sopeerle.ss asyouought nottocarry flowers," exclaimed
theogre; "Iwillcarry them foryou." And sosaying, hepicked upthe
flowei's andfollowed withthem intherear oftheBodhisatta.
Seeing thisfrom afar, theBodhisatta's father knew that hisplothad
failed. "Isentmysontofallaprey totheogre,andhereheisreturn-
ingsafeandsound, with theogrehumbly carrying hisflowers forhim !
Iamundone!" cried theoldmonkey, and hisheart burst asunder [283]
intoseven pieces, sothathedied thenand there. And alltheother
monkeys mettogether andchose theBodhisatta tobetheir king.
Hislesson ended, the]\Iaster shewed theconnexion andidentified theBirth
bysaying,"Devadatta wasthen theking ofthemonkeys, and Ihisson."

148 TheJataka. Booh I.
Once onatimewhen Bralimadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasabrahmin inthe city ofTakkasila inthe
Gandliara country ;andbythetime heliadgrown up,such was his
proficiency intheThree Vedas and allaccomplishments, that hisfame as
ateacher spread through alltheworld.
Inthose days there wasabrahmin family inBenares, untowhom a
sonwasbom;andonthedayofhisbirth they took fireandkept it
always bvirning, until theboywas sixteen. Then hisparents toldhim
how the fire,kindled onthedayofhisbirth, hadnever been allowed to
goout ;andtheybade their sonmake hischoice. Ifhisheart was set
onwinning enti'ance hereafter into theRealm ofBrahma, then lethim
takethe fireand retire with ittotheforest, there towork outhisdesire
byceaseless worship oftheLord ofFire. But, ifhepreferred thejoys
ofahome, theybade their songotoTakkasila andthere study under
theworld-famed teacher with aview tosettling down tomanage the
pi'operty. "Ishould surely failintheworship oftheFire-God," said
theyoung brahmin; "I'll beasquire." Sohebade farewell tohisfather
andmother, and,with athousand pieces ofmoney fortheteacher's fee,
setoutforTakkasila. There hestudied tillhiseducation wascomplete,
andthen betook himself home again.
Now hisparents grew towishhimtoforsake theworld andtoworship
theFire-God inthe forest. Accordingly hismother, inherdesire to
desjiatch him totheforest bybringing home tohim thewickedness of
women, wasconfident that hiswiseandlearned teacher would beable
tolaybarethewickedness ofthesextoherson,andsosheasked whether
hehadquite finished hiseducation. "Oh yes," saidtheyouth.
[286]"Then ofcourse youhave notomitted theDolour Texts?" "I
have notlearnt those, mother." "How thencanyousayyour education
isfinished? Goback atonce,myson, toyour master, andreturn to
uswhen youhave learnt them," said hismother.
"Very good," saidtheyouth, and offhestai-ted forTakkasila once
more.
Now hismaster toohadamother,— anoldwoman ofahundred and
twenty years ofage,—whom with hisownhands heused tobathe, feed
andtend. And forsodoing hewasscorned byhisneighbours,—somuch
soindeed thatheresolved todepart totheforest and there dwell with
hismother. Accordingly, inthesolitude ofaforest hehadahutbuilt
inadelightful spot, where water was plentiful, and after laying ina
stock ofgheeand riceandother provisions, hecarried hismother toher
newhome, andthere lived cherishing heroldage.
Not finding hismaster atTakkasila, theyoung brahmin made en-
quiries, and finding outwhat hadhappened, setout forthe forest, and
presented himself respectfully before hismaster. "What brings you


No. 61. 149
back sosoon,mybay?" saidthe latter. "Idonotthink, sir,1learned
theDolour Texts when Iwaswith you," saidtheyouth. "Butwho told
youthatyouhadtolearn theDolour Texts?""Mymother, master," was
thereply. Hereon theBodhisatta reflected that there werenosuch texts
asthose, andconcluded that hispupil's mother must have wanted her
sontolearnhowwicked women were. Sohesaid totheyouth that it
was allright, andthatheshould induecourse betaught theTexts in
question. "From to-day," said he,"you shall takemyplace aboutmy
mother, andwith yourownhands wash, feedandlook after her.As
yourubherhands, feet, head and back, becareful toexclaim, 'Ah,
Madam! ifyouaresolovely nowyouaresoold,what must younot
havebeen intheheyday ofyour youth!' And asyouwash andperfume
herhands and feet, burst into praise oftheir beauty. Further, tellme
without shame orreserve every single wordmymother says toyou. Obey
meinthis,andyou shallmaster theDolour Texts ;disobey me,andyou
shallremain ignorant ofthem forever."
Obedient tohismaster's commands, theyouth did allhewasbidden,
and sopersistently praised theoldwoman's beauty that shethought he
had fallen inlove with her; and, blind and decrepit though shewas,
passion waskindled within her[287]. Soonedayshebroke inonhiscom-
pliments byasking, "Isyour desire towards me?" "It isindeed, madam,"
answered theyouth; "butmymaster issostrict." "Ifyoudesire me,"
said she,"killmyson!" "Buthow shall I,thathave learned somuch
from him,—how shall Iforpassion's sake killmymaster?" "Well then,
ifyouwillbefaithful tome, Iwill killhimmyself."
(So lustful, vile,anddegraded arewomen that, giving therein tolust,
ahag like this,and oldasshewas, actually thirsted fortheblood ofso
dutiful ason!)
Now theyoung brahmin told allthis totheBodhisatta, who, com-
mending him forreporting thematter, studied howmuch longer his
mother wasdestined tolive. Finding thatherdestiny was todiethat
very day,hesaid,"Come, young brahmin; Iwillputhertothetest." So
hecutdown afig-tree andhewed outofitawooden figure about hisown
size,which hewrapped up,headand all,inarobeandlaidupon hisown
bed,—with astring tied toit."Now gowithanaxetomymother," said
he;"and giveherthisstring asaclue toguide hersteps."
Soaway went theyouth totheoldwoman, and said,"Madam, the
master islyingdown indoors onhisbed; Ihave tied thisstring asaclue
toguide you; take thisaxeand killhim, ifyoucan." "But youwon't
forsake me,willyou?" said she."Why should 11"was hisreply. So
shetook theaxe, and, rising upwith trembling limbs, groped herway
along bythestring, tillshethought she felther son. Then shebared
thehead ofthefigure,and— thinking tokillhersonatasingleblow—


150 The Jcltaka. Book I.
brought down theaxeright onthefigure's throat,—only tolearnbythe
thud that itwaswood! "What areyoudoing, mother?" saidtheBodhi-
satta. With ashriek that shewasbetrayed, theoldwoman felldead to
theground. For, says tradition, itwasfated that sheshould dieatthat
verymoment andunder herown roof.
Seeing that shewas dead, hersonburnt lierbody, and,when the
flames ofthe pilewere quenched, graced herashes with wild-flowers.
Then with theyoung brahmin hesatatthedoor ofthehutand said,
"My son,there isnosuch separate passage asthe'Dolour Text.' [28S]
Itiswomen who aredepi'avity incarnate. Andwhen yourmother sent
youback tometolearn theDolour Texts, her object was thatyou
shoidd learnhowwicked women are.Youhavenowwitnessed withyour
owneyesmymother's wickedness, andtherefrom you willseehow lustful
and vilewomen are."Andwith this lesson, hebade theyouth depart.
Bidding farewell tohismaster, theyoung brahmin wenthome tohis
parents. Said hismother tohim, "Have younow leai-nt theDolour
Texts 1"
"Yes,mother."
"And what," slieasked, "isyour final choice? willyou leave the
woi-ld toworship the Loixl ofFire, orwillyouchoose afamily life?"
"Nay," answered theyoung bi-ahmin; "with myown eyeshave Iseen
thewickedness ofwomankind ;Iwillhavenothing todowith family life.
Iwillrenounce theworld." And hisconvictions found vent inthis
stanza:—
Inlustunbridled, likedevouring fire,
Arewomen,—frantic intheir rage.
The sexrenouncing, fainwould Iretire
Tofindpeace inahermitage.
[289]With thisinvective against womankind, theyoung brahmin took
leave ofhispai'ents, andrenounced theworld forthehermit's life,—
wherein winning thepeace hedesired, heassured himself ofadmittance
after that lifeintotheRealm ofBrahma.
"Soyou see.Brother," saidtheMaster, "how lustful, vile,andwoe-bringing
arewomen." And after declaring thewickedness ofwomen, hepreached the
Four Truths, attheclose whereof thatBrother wontheFruit oftheFirst Path.
Lastly, tlieMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth bysaying,
"Kapilanli wasthemother ofthose days,Maha-Kassapa wasthefather, Anauda
the pu))il, and Imyself theteacher."

"Blindfold, a-lutiuff."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about another passioii-tost person.
SaidtheMaster, "Isthereport truethatyouarepassion-tost, Brother 1"
"Quite true," wasthereply.
"Brother, women cannotbewarded;indays gonebythewisewhokept
watch overawoman from themoment shewasborn, failed nevertheless tokeep
hersafe." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta came tolifeasthechild oftheQueen-consort. When liegrew
up,hemastered every accomplishment;andwhen, athisfather's death,
hecame tobeking, hoproved arighteous king.Nowheused toplay at
dicewith hischaplain, and, asheflung thegolden diceupon thesilver
table, hewould sing thiscatch forluck :—
'Tisnatm-e's lawthat rivers wind;
Trees grow ofwood bylawofkind;
And, given opportunity.
Allwomen work iniquity.
[290]Asthese linesalways made thekingwinthegame, thechaplain was
inafairway toloseevery penny hehad intheworld. And, inorder
tosave himself from utter ruin, heresolved toseek outalittle maid
thathadnever seen another man,andthen tokeep herunder lockand
keyinhisown house. "For," thought he,"Icouldn't manage tolook
after agirlwho hasseen another man. SoImust take anew-born
baby girl,andkeep herundermythumb asshegrows up,with aclose
guard over her, sothatnonemaycome near herandthat shemay be
true tooneman. Then Ishallwin oftheking, andgrow rich." Now
hewas skilled inprognostication ;and seeing apoorwoman whowas
about tobecome amother, andknowing thatherchild would beagirl,
hepaid thewoman tocome andbeconfined inhishouse, andsenther
away after herconfinement with a])resent. Theinfant wasbrought up
entirely bywomen, andnomen—other than himself—were everallowed
toseteyesonher.When thegirlgrew up,shewassubject tohimand
hewashermaster.
Now, while the girlwasgrowing up,thechaplain forbore toplay
with theking; butwhen shewasgrown upandunder hisown control.


152 21ieJdtaka. Book I.
hechallenged theking toagame. Theking accepted, andplay began.
But,when inthrowing the dice theking sang hislucky catch, the
chaplain added,—"always excepting my girl." And then luck changed,
and itwasnowthechaplain whowon, while theking lost.
Thinking thematter over, theBodhisatta suspected thechaplain had
avirtuous girlshutupinhishouse; andenquiry proved hissuspicions
true. Then, inorder towork her fall,hesent foraclever scamp, and
asked whether hethought hecould seduce the girl. "Certainly, sire,"
saidthefellow. Sothekinggavehimmoney, andsenthimaway with
orders tolosenotime.
With theking's money thefellow bought perfumes andincense and
aromatics ofallsorts, andopened aperfumery shop close tothechaplain's
house. Now thechaplain's house wasseven stories high,andhadseven
gateways, ateach ofwhich aguard was set,—^aguard ofwomen only,—-
andnomanbutthebrahmin himself waseverallowed toenter. Thevery
baskets thatcontained thedustandsweepings [291] wereexamined before
theywere passed in.Only thechaplain wasallowed toseethegirl,and
shehadonlyasingle waiting-woman. Thiswoman hadmoney given her
tobuyflowers andperfumes forhermistress, andonherwaysheused to
passnear theshopwhich thescamp hadopened. And he,knowing very
well that shewasthe girl's attendant, watched onedayfurhercoming,
and,rushing outofhisshop, fellather feet, clasping herknees tightly
with both hands andblubbering out, "mymother Iwhere have you
been allthislongtime?"
And hisconfederates, who stood byhisside, cried,"What alikeness !
Hand and foot, faceand figure, even instyle ofdress, they areidentical!"
Asoneand allkept dwelling onthemarvellous likeness, thepoorwoman
lostherhead. Ci'ying outthat itmust beherboy,shetooburst into tears.
Andwithweeping andtears thetwo felltoembracing oneanother. Then
saidtheman,"Where areyouliving, mother?"
"Up atthechaplain's, myson.Hehasayoung wife ofpeerless
beauty, avery goddess forgrace; andI'mherwaiting-woman." "And
whither away now, mother?" "Tobuy herperfumes and flowers."
"Why goelsewhere for tlieni ?Come tomeforthem infuture," said
thefellow. And hegave thewoman betel, bdellium, and soforth, and
allkinds offlowers, refusing allpayment. Struck with thequantity of
flowers andperfumes Avhich thewaiting-woman bi'ought home, the girl
askedwhythebrahmin wassopleased with herthat day."Why doyou
saythat,mydear?" asked theoldwoman. "Because ofthequantity of
things youhave brought home." "No, itisn't that thebrahmin was
freewith hismoney," saidtheoldwoman;"for Igotthem atmyson's."
Andfrom thatdayforth shekept themoney thebrahmin gave her,and

And he,afewdays later,made outtobe ill,andtook tohisbed.
Sowhen theoldwoman came totheshopandasked forherson,shewas
toldhehadbeen taken ill.Hastening tohisside, shefondly stroked
hisshoulders, assheasked what ailed him. Buthemade noreply.
"Why don't you tellme,mysou?'' "Not even ifIwere dying, could I

tell]" "Well then, mother, mymalady liessolely inthis that, hearing the
praises ofyouryoung mistress's beauty, Ihave fallen inlovewith her.
It'Iwin her, Ishall live; ifnot, this willbemydeath-bed." "Leave
that tome,myboy," said theoldwoman cheerily ;"and don't worry
yourself onthisaccount." Then—with aheavy load ofperfumes and
flowers totakewith her—shewent home, andsaid tothebrahmin's young
wife, "Alas! here'smysoninlovewith you,merely because Itoldhim
howbeautiful youare !What istobodone 1"
"Ifyoucansmuggle him inhere," replied the girl,"you havemy
leave."
Hereupon theoldwoman settowork sweeping together allthedust
shecould findinthehouse from toptobottom ;thisdust sheputintoa
huge flower-basket, andtried topassoutwith it.When theusual search
wasmade, sheemptied dust over thewoman onguard, who fledaway

And soitcame topassfrom thattime forward that,nomatter what the

Hesucceeded inwrecking the girl's virtue, andactually stayed adayor

enjoying the society ofhismistress when thechaplain was offthe

should solike todance, ifyouwould play thelute forme." "Dance

156 TlieJataka. Book I.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta, whohadchosen ananchorite's life,built himself ahermitage
bythebanks oftheGanges, andtherewon theAttainments andthe
Higher Knowledges, andsodwelt inthebliss ofInsight. Inthose days
theLordHigh Treasurer ofBenares hadatierce and cruel daughter,
known asLady Wicked, whoused torevile andbeatherservants and
slaves. And onedaythey took theiryoung mistress [296] todisport
herself intheGanges ;andthe girls were playing about inthewater,
when thesun setand agreat storm burst upon them. Hereon folks
scampered away, and the girl's attendants, exclaiming, "Now isthe
time toseethelast ofthis creature!"threw herright into theriver
andhurried oflf.Down poured therain intorrents, thesun set,and
darkness came on.Andwhen theattendants reached home without
theiryoung mistress, andwere asked where shewas,they replied thatshe
hadgotoutoftheGanges butthattheydidnotknow where shehadgone.
Search wasmade byherfamily, butnotatrace ofthemissing girlcould
befound.
Meantime she,screaming loudly, wasswept down bytheswollen
stream, and atmidnight approached where theBodhisatta dwelt in liis
hermitage. Hearing her cries, hethought tohimself, "That's awoman's
voice. Imust rescue herfrom thewater." Sohetook atorch ofgrass
andby itslight desci'ied herinthestream. "Don't beafraid ;don't
beafraid!"heshouted cheerily, andwaded in,and,thanks tohisvast
strength, asofanelephant, brought her safe toland. Then hemade
afire forherinhishermitage and setluscious fruits ofdivers kinds
before her.Not tillshehadeaten didheask,"Where isyourhome, and
howcame you tofallintheriver?" And the girl toldhim allthat
hadbefallen her. "Dwell here forthepresent," said he,and installed
herinhishermitage, whilst forthenexttwo orthree days hehimself

Arrived there, they leteverybody elsegofree ;butthe girl,because ofher
beauty, wastaken towifebytherobber chieftain.
Andwhen theBodhisatta learned this,hethought tohimself, "Shewill
notendure toliveaway from me.She willescape andcome back tome."
And sohelived on,waiting forhertoreturn. Shemeantime wasvery
happy with therobbers, andonly feared that theDate-sage would come to
carry heraway again. "Ishould feelmore secure," thought she, "ifhe

Andhesaidhewould dothisandthat tohim.
"Perhaps heisnotsofaraway asyou think," said she. "He is

Seizing atorch, therobber rushed inand seized theBodhisatta and
beathimabout theheadandbody tohisheart's content. Amid theblows
theBodhisatta made nocry,onlymurmuring, "Cruel ingrates !slanderous

This settherobber a-thinking again, andhethought, "Ifshecanfeel

Bodhisatta andhaving awakened thewoman, hesetoutsword inhand,

became hermits together, anddwelt inthehermitage intheforest, where
theywon theHigher Knowledges andtheAttainments, and qualified
themselves when lifeended toenter theRealm ofBrahma.
After telling these two stories, theMaster shewed theconnexion, byreciting,
asBuddha, thisstanza:—
Wrathful arewomen, slanderers, ingrates.
Thesowers ofdissension and fell strife !
Then, Brother, tread thepath ofholiness,
And Bliss therein thou shalt not failtofind.

make herout. Sheworried him somuch thathedidnotgotowait onthe
Buddha.
Onedayhewent withperfumes andflowers, andhadtaken hisseat afterdue
salutation, when theMaster said tohim:—"Prayhowcomes it,lay-brother,
thatseven oreight dayshave gonebywithout yourcoming towaitupon the
Buddha]" "My wife, sir, isoneday likeaslave-girl bought forahundred
pieces, while another dayfinds herlikeapassionate andtyrannical mistress. I
cannot make herout ;and itisbecause shehasworried mesothat Ihavenot

existences havecome tobeconfused inhismind, sothathecannot remember."
And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tobeateacher ofworld-wide fame, with fiveliundred
young brahmins studying under liira. [300] One ofthese pupils was
ayoung brahmin from aforeign land,who fellinlovewith awoman
andmade her liiswife. Though hecontinued toliveoninBenares,
hefailed two orthree times inhisattendance onthemaster. For,
youshould know, hiswifewas asinful andwicked woman, whowas
asmeek asaslave ondayswhen shehaddone wrong, butondayswhen
shehadnotdonewrong, playedmylady, passionate andtyrannical. Her
husband could notmake heroutatall ;andsoworried andharassed by
lierwashethatheabsented him.self from waiting ontheMaster. Now,
some seven oreight days laterherenewed hisattendances, andwasasked
bytheBodhisatta whyhehadnotbeen seen oflate.
"Master, mywife isthecause," said he.AndhetoldtheBodhisatta
howshewasmeek onedaylikeaslave-girl, andtyrannical thenext; how
hecould notmake heroutatall,andhowhehadbeen soworried and
harassed byhershifting moods thathehadstayed away.
"Precisely so,young brahmin," saidtheBodhisatta; "ondayswhen
theyhavedone wrong, women humble themselves before their husbands
andbecome asmeek andsubmissive asaslave-girl ;butondayswhen
theyhave notdonewrong, thentheybecome stiff-necked andinsubordinate
totheir lords. After thismanner arewomen sinful andwicked;andtheir
nature ishard toknow. Noheed should bepaid either totheir likes or
totheir dislikes." And sosaying, theBodhisatta repeated fortheedifica-
tion ofhispupil thisStanza:—

Think'st thou sheloves thee not ?—forbear togrieve.

forward paidnoheed tohiswife's caprices. And she,hearing thather
misconduct hadcome totheears oftheBodhisatta, ceased from thattime

Sotoothis lay-brother's wife said toherself, "The Perfect Buddha himself

"TillOentle-heart wasmine"—This story wastoldbytheMaster while at
Jetavaua, about concupiscence. Tradition says that ayoung gentleman of
Savatthi, [303] onhearing theTruth preached bytheMaster, gave hisheart to
theDoctrine oftheThree Gems. Renouncing theworld fortheBrother's life,
herose towalk inthePaths, topractise meditation, andnever toslacken inhis
pondering over thetheme hehadchosen forthought. Oneday, whilst hewas
onhisround foralms through Savatthi, heespied awoman inbrave attire, and,
forpleasure's sake, broke through thehigher morality andgazed upon her!
Passion wasstirred within him,hebecame even asafig-tree felled bytheaxe.
From thatday forth, imder thesway ofpassion, thepalate ofhismind, asof
hisbody, lost allitsgust; likeabrute beast, hetooknojoyintheDoctrine, and
suffered hisnailsandhairtogrow longandhisrobes togrow foul.
When hisfriends among theBrethren became aware ofhistroubled state of
mind, they said,"Why, sir, isyour moral state otherwise than itwas?" "My
joyhasgone," said he.Then theytookhimtotheMaster, whoasked themwhy
theyhadbrought thatBrother there against hiswill. "Because, sir,hisjoyis
gone." "Isthat true, Brother?" "It is,Blessed One." "Who hastroubled
you?" "Sir, Iwasonmyround foralms when, violating thehigher morality,

violating morality, youwere gazing forpleasure's sakeonanexceptional object,
youwere stirred byj^assion. Why, inbj'gone times, even thosewhohadwon
thefiveHigher Knowledges andtheeight Attainments, thosewhobythemight
ofInsight hadquelled their passions, whose hearts were purified andwhose feet
could walk the skies, yeaeven Bodhisattas, through gazing inviolation of

passion beabashed before 3'ou 1Why, even piu'ified Ijeings areledastray by
passion, andthose advanced tothehighest honoiir, come toshame." And so
saying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into arichbrahmin family intheKasi country.
When hewasgrown upandhadfinished hiseducation, herenoimced all
Lusts, and,forsaking theworld forthehermit's life,went tolive inthe
solitudes oftheHimalayas. There byduefulfilment ofallpreparatory
forms ofmeditation, hewonbyabstract thought theHigher Knowledges
andtheecstatic Attainments ;andsolived his lifeinthebliss ofmystic
Insight.
[304] Lack ofsaltandvinegar brought himonedaytoBenares, where
hetookuphisquarters intheking's pleasaunce. Next day, after seeing
tohisbodily needs, hefolded uptheredsuitofbai-kwhich hecommonly
wore, threw overoneshoulder ablack antelope's skin, knotted histangled
locks inacoilonthetopofhishead, andwith ayokeonhisbackfrom
which hung twobaskets, setoutonhisround inquest ofalms. Coming
tothepalace-gates onhisway, hisdemeanour socommended him tothe
king that hismajesty hadhimbrought inSotheascetic wasseated ona
couch ofgreat splendour and fedwith abundance ofthedaintiest food.
Andwhen hethanked theking, hewasinvited totakeuphisdwelling
inthepleasaunce. The ascetic accepted the offer, and forsixteen years
abode inthepleasaunce, exhorting theking's household andeating ofthe
king's meat.
Now there came adaywhen thekingmust gototheborders toput
down arising. But, before hestarted, hecharged hisqueen, whose name
wasGentle-heart, tominister tothewants oftheholyman. So,after
theking's departure, theBodhisatta continued togowhen hepleased to

and layclown, awaiting hiscoming, onalittle couch inthespacious
chamber.
Waking from rapture ofInsight, andseeing how late itwas, the
Bodhisatta transported himself through theairtothepalace. Heai'ing
therustling ofhisbark-robe, thequeen started uphurriedly toreceive
him. Inherhurry torise,hertunic slipped down, sothat herbeauty
wasrevealed totheascetic asheentered thewindow ;andatthesight, in
violation ofMorality hegazed forpleasure's sake onthemarvellous
beauty ofthequeen. Lustwaskindled within him;hewas asatree
felled bytheaxe.Atonce allInsight deserted him,andhebecame
asacrow with itswings clipped. Clutching hisfood, stillstanding, he
atenot,buttook hisway, alla-tremble with desire, from thepalace tohis
hutinthepleasaunce, set itdown beneath hiswooden couch andthereon
layforseven whole days aprey tohunger and thirst, enslaved bythe
queen's loveliness, hisheart aflame with lust.
Ontheseventh day, thekingcame Imckfrom pacifying theborder.
After passing insolemn procession round the city,heentered hispalace.
[30.'i] Then, wishing toseetheascetic, hetook hisway tothepleasaunce,
andthere inthe cellfound theBodhisatta lyiug onhiscouch. Thinking
theholymanhadbeen taken ill,theking, after firsthaving the cell
cleaned out, asked, ashestroked the sufferer's feet,what ailed him.
"Sire,myheart isfettered bylust; that ismysoleailment." "Lust for
whom 1""For Gentle-heart, sire." "Then she isyours;Igive her
toyou," saidtheking. Then hepassed with theascetic tothepalace, and
bidding thequeen array herself inallhersplendour, gave hertothe
Bodhisatta. But, ashewasgiving heraway, theking privily charged the
queen toputforth herutmost endeavour tosave theholyman.
"Fear not, sire," said thequeen ;"Iwillsave him." Sowith the
queen the ascetic went outfrom thepalace. Butwhen hehadpassed
through thegreat gate, thequeen cried outthattheymust have ahouse

Hereon hecame tohimself after hisinterval ofwitless folly.
(And hereshould berepeated thetextbeginning, "Thus thehindrances
ofLustandLonging arecalled Evils because they spring from Ignorance,
Brethren;[306] thatwhich springs from Ignorance creates Darkness.")
Sowhen hehadcome tohimself, hebethought himhow,waxing

after sixweeks' zealous application tohigh thinking, fellunder thedominion of
Lusts and oft'liewent. Hisbelly again proving toomuch forhim, [312] backhe
came tojoin theBrotherhood once more, andstudied theAbhidhammai. In
thisway, sixtimes heleftandcame back again;butwhen fortheseventh time
hebecame aBi-other, hemastered thewhole seven books oftheAVjhidhamma,
andbymuch chanting oftheDoctrine oftheBrothers wonDiscernment and
attained toArahatship. Now hisfriends among theBrethren scoffed athim,
saying—"Can itbe, sir,that Lusts have ceased tospring upwithin your
heart/"
"Sirs," wasthereply, "Ihavenowgotbeyond mundane lifehenceforth."
Hehaving thuswonArahatship, talkthereof arose intheHall ofTruth, as
follows:—"Sirs, thougli allthewhile hewasdestined toalltheglories ofArahat-
ship, yetsixtimes did(Jittahattha-Sariputta renounce theBrotherhood;truly,
verywrong istheunconverted state."
Returning totheHall, theMaster asked what they were talking about.
Being told,hesaid, "Brethren, theworldling's heart islightandhard tocurb;
material things attract andhold itfast;when once itissoheld fast, itcannot
bereleased inatrice. Excellent isthemasteiy ofsuchaheart ;oncemastered,
itbrings joyandhappiness:—
'Tisgood totame aheadstrong heart and frail.
Bypassicm swayed. Once tamed, theheart brings bliss.
Itwasbyreason ofthisheadstrong quality oftheheart, however, that, forthe
sake ofapretty spade which they could notbring themselves tothrow away, the
wiseandgood ofbygone days sixtimes reverted totheworld outofsheer
cupidity;butontheseventh occasion theywon Insight andsubdued their
cupidity." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeagain asagardener, andgrew up.'Spade Sage'
was hisname. With hisspade hecleared apatch ofground, andgrew
pot-herbs, pumpkins, gourds, cucumbers, andother vegetables, bythesale
ofwhich hemade asorry living. For, saveonly thatonespade, hehad
nothing intheworld !Resolving oneday toforsake theworld forthe
religious life,hehidhisspade away, andbecame arecluse. Butthoughts
ofthatspade roseinhisheart andthepassion ofgi-eed overcame him, so
that forthesake ofhisblunt spade hereverted totheworld. [313] Again
andagain thishappened ;sixtimes didhehide thespade andbecome a
recluse,—only torenounce hisvows again. Buttheseventh time he
bethought himhowthatblunt spade hadcaused himagain andagain to
backslide ;andhemade uphismind tothrow itinto agreat river before
hebecame arecluse again. Sohecarried thespade totheriver-side, and,
fearing lest ifhesawwhere itfell,heshould come back and fish itout
again, hewhirled thespade thrice round hisheadbythehandle andflung

itwith thestrength ofanelephant I'ight intomid-stream, shutting hiseyes
tight ashedid so.Then loudrang hisshout ofexultation, ashout likea
lion's I'oai',—"Ihave conquered !Ihaveconquered!"
Now just atthatmoment theKing ofBenares, onhiswayhome from
quelling disorder ontheborder, hadbeen bathing inthatvery rivei", and
wasriding along inallhissplendour ontheback ofhiselephant, when he
heard theBodhisatta's shout oftriumph. "Here's aman," saidtheking,
"who isproclaiming thathehasconquered. Iwonder whom hehas
conquered. Go,bringhimbefore me."
SotheBodhisatta wasbrought before theking,who saidtohim, "My
goodman, Iamaconqueror myself; Ihave justwonabattle andamon
mywayhome victorious. Tellmewhom youhave conquered." "Sire,"
saidtheBodhisatta, "athousand, yea,ahundred thousand, such victories
asyours arevain, ifyouhave notthevictory over theLusts within your-
self. Itisbyconquering greed within myself thatIhaveconquered my
Lusts." And ashespoke, hegazed upon thegreat river, andbyduly
concentrating allhismindupon theidea ofwater, won Insight. Then by
virtue ofhisnewly-won transcendental powers, herose inthe air,and,
seated there, instructed theKing intheTruth inthisstanza:—
Theconquest thatbyfurther victories
Must beupheld, orown defeat atlast,
Isvain !True conquest lasts forevermore !
[314]Even ashelistened totheTruth, light shone inontheking's
darkness, andtheLusts ofhisheart were quenched ;hisheart wasbent
onrenouncing theworld ;then andthere thelust forroyal dominion
passed away from him. "Andwhere willyougonow 1"saidtheking to
theBodhisatta. "To theHimalayas, sire; there tolivetheanchorite's
life." "Then I,too, willbecome ananchorite," said theking; andhe
departed with theBodhisatta. And with theking there departed alsothe
whole army, allthebrahmins andhouseholders and allthecommon folk,—inawoi'd, allthehost thatwasgathered there.
Tidings came toBenares that their king, onhearing theTruth preached
bytheSpade Sage, wasfain tolivetheanchorite's lifeandhadgone forth
with allhishost."And what shallwedohere?" cried thefolkofBenares.
And thereupon, from outthat citywhich wastwelve leagues about, allthe
inhabitants went forth, atrain twelve leagues long, withwhom theBodhi-
satta passed totheHimalayas.
Then thethrone ofSakka, King ofDevas, became hotbeneath him '.

Renunciation'. Marking thenumbers ofhisfollowing, Indra tookthought
how tohouse them all.Andhesent forVissakamma, thearchitect ofthe
Devas, andspoke thus:—"TheSpade Sage isengaged upon aGreat
Renunciation, [315] andquarters must befound forhim. Goyoutothe
Himalayas, andthere onlevelground fashion bydivine power ahermit's
demesne thirty leagues longand fifteen broad."
"Itshall bedone, sire," saidVissakamma. Andaway hewent, and
didwhat hewasbidden.
(What follows isonlyasummary ;thefulldetails willbegiven inthe
Hatthipala-jritaka'-, which forms onenarrative with this.) Vissakamma
caused ahermitage toarise inthehermit's demesne ;drove away allthe
noisy beasts andbirdsand fairies ;andmade ineach cardinal direction a
path justbroad enough foroneperson topassalong itatatime. This
done, hebetook himself tohisownabode. TheSpade Sage with hishost
ofpeople came totheHimalayas andentered thedemesne which Indra
hadgiven andtook possession ofthehouse andfurniture which Vissa-
kamma hadcreated forthehermits. First ofall,herenounced theworld
himself, andafterwards made thepeople renounce it.Then heportioned
outthedemesne among them. They abandoned alltheir sovereignty, which
rivalled that ofSakka himself; and thewhole thirty leagues ofthe
demesne were filled. Bydueperformance ofalltheother^ rites that
conduce toInsight, theSj)ade Sage developed perfect good-will within
himself, andhetaught thepeople how tomeditate. Hereby they all
wontheAttainments, andassured their entry thereafter intotheBrahma-
Realm, whilst allwho ministered tothem qualified forentry thereafter
intotheRealm ofDevas.
"Thus, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "the heart, when passion holds itfast, is
hard torelease. When theattributes ofgreed spring upwithin it,they arehard
tochase away, andeven persons sowiseandgood astheabove arethereby
rendered witless." His lesson ended, hepreached theTruths, attheclose
whereof somewontheFirst, some theSecond, andsome theThird Path, whilst
others again attained toArahatship. Further, theMaster shewed thecon-
nexion and identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wastheking ofthose
days, theBuddha's followers were thefollowers, and Imyself theSpade Sage."

[316] ''Learn thoufrom him."—This .story wastoldbytheMaster while at
Jetavaiia, about theElder named Tissa the.Squire's Son. Tradition saysthat
onedaythirty young gentlemen ofSavatthi, whowere allfriends ofoneanother,
tookperfumes andflowers and robes, and setoutwith alarge retimie toJeta-
vana, inorder toheartheMaster preach. Ai-rivcd atJetavana, they satawhile
intheseveral enclosures —intheenclosure oftheIron-wood trees, inthe
enclosure ofthe ISal-trees, andsoforth,—tillatevening theMaster passed from
hisfragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber totheHall ofTruth andtook his
seatonthegorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, theseyoung men
went totheHall ofTruth, made anollering ofperfumes and flowers, bowed
down athisfeet—tho.se ble.ssed feetthatwere glorious asfull-blown lotus-dowers,
andboreimprinted onthesoletheWheel!—and, taking their .seats, listened
totheTruth. Then thethought came into their minds, "Let ustake thevows,
sofarasweunderstand theTruth preached bytheMaster." Accoixlingly, when
the Bles.sed One lefttheHall, they approtiched himandwithdueobeLsance
asked tobeadmitted totheBrotherhood ;andtheMaster admitted them tothe
Brotherhood. Winning thefavour oftheir teachers anddirectors they received
fullBrotherhood, andafterhveyears' residence with their teachers anddirectors,
bywhich timetheyhadgotbyheart thetwoAlistracts, hadcome toknow what
wasproper andwhat wasimpi-oper, hadlearnt the thi'ee modes ofexpressing
thanks, andhadstitched andtlyed robes. Atthisstage, wishing toembrace the
ascetic life,they obtained theconsent oftheir teachers and directors, and
approached theMaster. Bowing before himtheytook their seats, saying, "Sir,
wearetroubled bytheround ofexistence, dismayed bybirth, decay, disease, and
death;giveusatheme, bythinking onwhich wemaygetfreefrom theelements
which occasion existence." TheMaster turned over inhismind theeight and
thirty themes ofthought, andtherefrom selected asuitable one,which he
expounded tothem. And then, after getting theirtheme from theMaster, they
bowed andwith aceremonious farewell passed from hispresence totheir cells,
and after gazing ontheir teachers anddirectors went forth withbowlandrobe
toembrace theascetic life.
Nowamongst them wasaBrother named theElder Tissa theSquire's Son,
aweakand irre.solute man, aslave tothepleasures ofthetaste. Thought heto
himself, "1shall never beable toliveintheforest, tostrive with strenuous
effort, andsubsist ondoles offood. What isthegood ofmygoing? Iwillturn
back." And sohegave up,andafteraccompanying those Brothers somewayhe
turned back. Astotheother Brothers, theycame inthecourse oftheir alms-
pilgrimage through Kosala toacertain border- village, [317] hardbywhich ina
wooded spotthey kept theKainy-season, andbythree months' striving and
wrestling gotthegeim ofDiscernment andwonArahatship, making theearth
shout forjoy.AttheendoftheKainy-season, after celebi'ating thePavarana

greeted them kindly andtheyannoimced totheBlessed Onetheattainments

praise, theElder Tissa theSquire's Sonwas filled with adesire tolivethe life

Now theElder Tissa theSquire's Sonthatvery night was inflated with a
yearning tobegin hisausterities atonce,andwhilst practising with excessive
zealandardour themethods ofarecluse andsleeping inanupright posture by
theside ofhisplank-bed, soon after themiddle watch ofthenight, round he
turned anddown he fell,breaking histhigh-bone; andsevere pains set in,so
thattheother Brothers hadtonurse himandweredebarred from going.
Accordingly, when theyappeared atthehour forwaiting ontheBuddha, he
asked them whether they laadnotyesterday asked hisleave tostart to-day.
"Yes, sir,wedid;butourfriend theElder Tissa theSquire's Son, while
rehearsing themethods ofarecluse with great vigour butoutofseason, dropped
ofl'tosleepand fellover, breaking histhigh ;andthat iswhyourdeparture has
been thwarted." "This isnotthe first time, Brethren," saidtheMaster, "that
thisman's backsliding hascaused him tostrive with unseasonable zeal,and
thereby todelay your departure; hedelayed your departure inthepast also."
Andhereupon, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatime atTakkasila inthekingdom ofGandhara theBodhisatta
wasateacher ofworld-wide fame, with 500young brahmins aspupils.
Onedaythese pupils setoutfortheforest togather firewood fortheir
master, andbusied themselves ingathering sticks. Amongst them wasa
lazy fellow whocame onahuge forest tree,which heimagined tobedry
and rotten. Sohethought thathecould safely indulge inana|) first,and
atthe lastmoment climb up[318] andbreak some branches offtocarry
home. Accordingly, hespread outhisouter robeand fellasleep, snoring
loudly. Alltheotheryoung brahmins were ontheirwayhome with their
wood tiedupinfaggots, when theycame upon thesleeper. Having
kicked him intheback tillheawoke, they lefthimandwent their way.
Hesprang tohisfeet,andrubbed hiseyes foratime. Then, still half
asleep, hebegan toclimb the tree. Butonebranch, which hewas
tugging at,snapped offshort ;and, asitsprang up,theendstruck himin
theeye. Clapping onehand over hiswounded eye,hegathered green
boughs with theother. Then climbing down, hecorded hisfaggot, and
afterhurrying awayhome with it,flung hisgreen wood onthetopofthe
others' faggots.
Thatsameday itchanced that acountry family invited themaster to
visitthem onthemorrow, inorder thatthey miglit give liim abrahmin-
feast.And sothemaster called liispupils together, and, telling them ofthe
journey theywould have tomake tothevillage onthemorrow, saidthey

"What, notyetonyourway,mysons 1"said he. "No, sir;wehave
not started." "Why, pray?""Because that lazy so-and-so, when he
went wood-gathering with us,laydown tosleep under aforest-tree;and,
tomake upforlosttime, heclimbed uj)thetree insuch ahurry thathe

andnofirecould shelight before thesunwas up.And this iswhat

afool's doings hadcaused allthemischief, andrepeated thisstanza:

SuchwastheBodhisatta's comment onthematter tohis[)upils ;andat
theclose ofalifeofcharity andother goodworks hepassed away tofare

Said theMaster, "This isnotthe first time. Brethren, that thisman has

Bodhisatta stood still,andthisbrought theman toastandstill too.Then
theBodhisatta again advanced, andagain theforester ranaway, halting
oncemorewhen theBodhisatta halted. Hereupon thetruth dawned on
theman that theelephant stood stillwhen hehimself ran,andonly
advanced when hehimself wasstanding still. Consequently heconcluded
that thecreatui'e could notmean tohurt, buttohelphim. Sohevaliantly
stood hisground this time. And theBodhisatta drew near and said,
"Why, friend man, areyouwandering about herelamenting?"
"My lord," replied theforester, "Ihave lostmybearings andmyway,
and fear toperish."
Then theelephant brought theman tohisown dwelling, andthere
entertained him forsome days, regaling himwith fruits ofevery kind.
Then, saying, "Fear not,friend man, Twillbring youback tothehaunts
ofmen," theelephant seated theforester onhisbackandbrought him to
where mendwelt. Buttheingrate thought tohimself, that, ifquestioned,
heought tobeable toreveal everything. So,ashetravelled along onthe
elephant's back, henoted thelandmarks oftreeand hill.Atlastthe
elephant brought himoutoftheforest andsethimdown onthehighroad
toBenares, saying, "There liesyoiir road, friend man :Tellnoman,
whether youarequestioned ornot, oftheplace ofmyabode." Andwith
thisleave-taking, theBodhisatta made hiswayback tohisownabode.
Arrived atBenares, themancame, inthecourse ofhiswalks through

the city, totheivory-workers' bazaar, where hesawivory being worked
into clivers forms andshapes. Andheasked thecraftsmen [321] whether
theywould giveanything forthetusk ofaliving elephant.
"What makes youasksuch aquestion ?"wasthereply."Aliving
elephant's tusk isworth agreat dealmore than adead one's."
"Oh,then, I'llbring yousome ivoi'y," said he,and offhesetfor
theBodhisatta's dwelling, with provisions forthejoui-ney, andwith a
sharp saw. Being asked whathadbrought himback, hewhined outthat
hewasinsosorry andwretched aplight thathecould notmake aliving
anyhow. Wherefore, hehadcome toask forabitofthekind elephant's
tusk tosellforaliving !"Certainly ;Iwillgiveyouawhole tusk,"
said theBodhisatta, "ifyouhave abitofasaw tocut itoffwith."
"Oh, Ibrought asawwith me, sir.""Then sawmytusks off,andtake
themaway with you," saidtheBodhisatta. And hebowed hisknees till
hewascouched upon theearth likeanox.Then theforester sawed off
both oftheBodhisatta's chief tusks !When theywere off,theBodhisatta
tookthem inhistrunk andthus addressed theman, "Think not, friend
man, that itisbecause Ivalue notnorprize these tusks that 1givethem
toyou. Butathousand times, ahundred-thousand times, dearer tome
arethetusks ofomniscience which cancomprehend allthings. And
therefore maymygiftofthese toyoubringmeomniscience." With these
words, hegave thepair oftusks totheforester astheprice ofomniscience.
And theman tookthem off,andsoldthem. Andwhen hehadspent
themoney, back hecame totheBodhisatta, saying thatthetwotusks had
onlybrought himenough topayhisolddebts, andbegging fortherest of
theBodhisatta's ivory. TheBodhisatta consented, andgaveuptherest
ofhisivory after having itcutasbefore. And theforester wentaway
andsold this also. Returning again, hesaid, "It'snouse,mylord;1
can'tmake aliving anvhow. Sogivemethestumps ofyour tusks."
"Sobeit,"answei'ed theBodhisatta ;andhelaydown asbefore.
Then that vilewretch, trampling upon thetrunk oftheBodhisatta, that
sacred trunk which waslikecorded silver, andclambering upon thefuture
Buddha's temples, which were asthesnowy eldest ofMount Kelasa,—kicked
attheroots ofthetusks tillhehadcleared thefleshaway. Then hesawed
outthestumps andwent hisway. Butscarce hadthewretch passed out
ofthesight oftheBodhisatta, when thesolid earth, inconceivable inits
vast extent, [322] which cansupport themighty weight ofMount Sineru
and itsencircling peaks, with alltheworld's unsavoury filthandordure,
now burst asunder inayawning chasm,—asthough unable tobear the

Not alltheworld canglut itsappetite.
With such teachings didtheTree-fairy make that forest re-echo. As

"TVjey hieiv thezrorM."— This story was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about going about tokill. For,seated intheHall ofTruth, the
Brotherhood wastalking ofDevadatta's wickedness, saying, "Sirs, Devadatta
hasnoknowledge oftheMaster's excellence; heactually goesabout tokill
him !"Here theMaster entered theHallandasked what theywere discussing.
[323] Being told, hesaid,"This isnotthe finst time, Brethren, thatDevadatta
hasgoneabout tokillme;hedidjustthesame inbygone days also." And so
saying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimeBrahmadatta wasreigning inBenares. Hehadason
named Prince Wicked. Fierce andcruel was he,likeascotched snake;
hespoke tonobody without abuse orblows. Like gritintheeyewasthis
prince toallfolkboth within andwithout thepalace, orlikearavening
ogre,—sodreaded and fellwashe.
Oneday,wishing todisport himself intheriver, hewent with alarge
retinue tothewater side.And agreat storm came on,andutter darkness

bathemethere, andthen bringmeback again." Sotheytookhiminto
mid-stream andthere took counsel together, saying, "What willtheking
dotolis1Letuskill thiswicked wretch hereandnow !Soinyou go,
youpest!"they cried, asthey flung him into thewater. When they
made theirwayashore, theywere asked where theprince was,andreplied,
"Wedon't seehim ;finding thestorm come on,hemusthavecome outof
theriverandgonehome ahead ofus,"
Thecourtiers went intotheking's presence, andtheking asked where
hissonwas. "Wedonotknow, sire," saidthey;"astorm came on,and
wecameaway inthebelief thathemust have goneonahead." Atonce
thekinghadthegates thrown open ;down totheriverside hewentand
bade diligent search bemade upanddown forthemissing prince. But
notrace ofhimcould befound. For, inthedarkness ofthestorm, hehad
been swept away bythecurrent, and,coming across atree-trunk, had
climbed ontoit,and sofloated down stream, crying lustily intheagony
ofhisfearofdrowning.
Now therehadbeen arichmerchant living inthose days atBenares,
whohaddied, leaving forty crores buried inthebanks ofthatsame river.
And because ofhiscraving forriches, hewasreborn asasnake atthe
spotunder which layhisdear treasui'e. And also inthese'lfsame spot
another manhadhidden thirty crores, andbecause ofhiscraving for
riches wasre-born asaratatthesame spot. Inrushed thewater into
their dwelling-place;andthetwocreatures, escaping bythewaybywhich
thewater rushed in,weremaking theirwayathwart thestream, when
theychanced upon thetree-trunk towhich theprince was clinging. [324]
Thesnake climbed upatoneend,andtheratattheother ;andsoboth
gotafooting with theprince onthetrunk.
Also there grew ontheriver's bank aSilk-cotton tree, inwhich lived
ayoung parrot; and this tree,being uprooted bytheswollen waters, fell
intotheriver. Theheavy rain beatdown theparrot when ittried tofly,
and italighted initsfallupon thissame tree-trunk. And sothere were
nowthese four floating down stream together upon thetree.
Now theBodhisatta hadbeen re-born inthose days asabrahmin in
theNorth-West country. Renouncing theworld forthehermit's lifeon
reaching manhood, hehad built himself ahermitage byabend ofthe
river ;andthere hewasnow living. Ashewaspacing toand fro,at
midnight, heheard theloud cries oftheprince, andthought thuswithin
himself:—"This fellow-creature must notperish thus before theeyes of
somerciful andcompassionate ahermit asIam. Iwillrescue himfrom
thewater, andsave hislife." Soheshouted cheerily, "Benotafraid! Be
notafraid !"andplunging across stream, seized hold ofthetreebyoneend,
and,being asstrong asanelephant, drew itintotliebank withonelong
pull,and settheprince safeandsound upon theshore. Then becoming


No. 73. 179
aware ofthesnake andtheratandtheparrot, hecarried them tohis
hermitage, andthere lighting afire,warmed theanimals first, asbeing
theweaker, andafterwards theprince. This done, hebrought fruits of
various kinds and setthem before hisguests, looking after theanimals
firstandtheprince afterwards. This enraged theyoung prince, who said
within himself, "This rascally hermit paysnorespect tomyroyal birth,
butactually gives brute beasts precedence overme."And heconceived
hatred against theBodhisatta !
Afewdays later,when allfourhadrecovered their strength andthe
waters hadsubsided, thesnake bade farewell tothehermit with these
words, "Father, youhavedonemeagreat service. Iamnotpoor, forI
have forty crores ofgold hidden atacertain spot. Should youever
want money, allmyhoard shall beyours. Youhave only tocome tothe
spotand call'Snake.'" Next therattook hisleave with alikepromise
tothehermit astohistreasure, bidding thehermit come and callout
'Rat.' [325]Then theparrot bade farewell, saying, "Father, silver andgold
have Inone ;butshould youeverwant forchoice rice,come towhere
Idwell and callout'Parrot;' andIwith theaidofmykinsfolk willgive
youmany waggon-loads ofrice." Lastcame theprince. Hisheart was
filled with base ingratitude andwith adetermination toputhisbenefactor
todeath, iftheBodhisatta should come tovisit him. But, concealing his
intent, hesaid,"Come, father, tomewhen Iamking, andIwillbestow
onyoutheFour Requisites." Sosaying, hetook hisdeparture, andnot
long after succeeded tothethrone.
Thedesire came ontheBodhisatta toputtheir professions tothetest;
and firstofallhewent tothesnake andstanding hardbyitsabode, called
out'Snake.' Attheword thesnake darted forth andwith every mark
ofrespect said, "Father, inthisplace there areforty crores ingold. Dig
themupandtakethem all." "It iswell," saidtheBodhisatta; "when I
need thejn, Iwillnotforget." Then bidding adieu tothesnake, hewent
ontowhere theratlived, and called out'Rat.' And theratdidasthe
snake haddone. Going next totheparrot, and calling out'Parrot,' the
birdatonce flewdown athiscallfrom thetree-top, andrespectfully asked
whether itwastheBodhisatta's wish thathewith theaidofhiskinsfolk
should gather paddy fortheBodhisatta from theregion round theHima-
layas. TheBodhisatta dismissed theparrot alsowithapromise that, ifneed
arose, hewould notforget thebird's offer. Last ofall,being minded to
testtheking inhisturn, theBodhisatta came totheroyal pleasaunce, and
onthedayafter hisarrival made hisway, carefully dressed, intothecity
onhisround foralms. Just atthatmoment, theungrateful king, seated
inallhisroyal splendour onhiselephant ofstate, waspassing insolemn
procession round thecityfollowed byavast retinue. Seeing theBodhi-
satta from afar,hethought tohimself, "Here's that rascally hermit come

toquarter himself and hisappetite onme. Imust have hishead off
before hecanpublish totheworld theservice herendered me." With
this intent, hesigned tohisattendants, and,ontheir asking what was
hispleasure, said,"Methinks yonder rascally hermit ishere toimportune
me. Seethat thepestdoesnotcome nearmyperson, butseizeandbind
him; [326] floghim atevery street-corner; andthenmarch himoutof
the city,chop offhishead attheplace ofexecution, andimpale his
body onastake."
Obedient totheir king's command, theattendants laidtheinnocent
Great Being inbonds andflogged him atevery street-corner ontheway
totheplace ofexecution. But alltheir floggings failed tomove the
Bodhisatta ortowring fromhimanycryof"Oh,mymother andfather!"
Allhedidwas torepeat thisStanza:—
Theyknew theworld, whoframed thisproverb true—
'Alogpays better salvage thansome men.'
These lines herepeated wherever hewas flogged, tillatlastthewise
among thebystanders asked thehermit what service hehad rendei'ed
totheir king. Then theBodhisatta toldthewhole story, ending with
thewords,—"So itcomes topassthatbyrescuing himfrom thetorrent I
brought allthiswoeupon myself. Andwhen Ibethink mehow Ihave
leftunheeded thewords ofthewise ofold,Iexclaim asyouhave heard."
Filled with indignation atthe recital, thenobles andbrahmins and all
classes withoneaccord cried out,"This ungrateful king doesnotrecognise
even thegoodness ofthisgoodmanwhosaved hismajesty's life.How
canwehave any profit from thisking 1Seize thetyrant!"And in
their anger they rushed upon theking from every side,andslewhim
there andthen, asherodeonhiselephant, with arrows andjavelins and
.stones andclubs andanyweapons thatcame tohand. Thecorpse they
dragged bytheheels toaditch andflung itin.Then theyanointed the
Bodhisatta kingandsethimtoruleoverthem.
Ashewasruling inrighteousness, oneday[327] thedesire came onhim
again totrythesnake andtheratandthepaiTot ;andfollowed bya
large retinue, hecame towhere thesnake dwelt. Atthe callof'Snake,'
outcame thesnake from hisholeandwith every mark ofrespect said,
"Here, mylord, isyour treasure ;take it."Then theking delivered the
forty crores ofgold tohisattendants, andproceeding towhere therat
dwelt, called, 'Rat.' Outcame the rat,andsaluted theking, andgaveup
itsthirty crores. Placing thistreasure toointhehands ofhisattendants,
thekingwentontowhere theparrot dwelt, and called 'Parrot.' And in
likemanner thebirdcame, andbowing down attheking's feetasked
whether itshould collect riceforhismajesty. "We willnottrouble you,"
saidtheking, "till rice isneeded. Now letusbegoing." Sowith the

seventy crores ofgold,andwith therat,thesnake, andtheparrot aswell,
thekingjourneyed back tothecity. Here, inanoble palace, tothestate-
story ofwhich hemounted, hecaused thetreasure tobelodged and
guarded ;hehadagolden tubemade forthesnake todwell in,acrystal

bytheking's command foodwasserved tothethree creatures invessels of
gold,—sweet parched-corn forthepari'ot andsnake, andscented rice for

harmony andgoodwill onewith another, these four lived their lives ;and
when theirendcame, theypassed away tofareaccording totheir deserts.
Said theMaster, "This isnotthe first time, Brethren, thatDevadatta has
gone about tokillme;hedidthehke inthepast also." Hislesson ended, he

Not tospeak ofhuman beings, even sense-lacking treesought tostand together.

Once onatimewheu Bralimadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
firstKing Vessavana^ died, andSakka sent anewking toreign inhis
stead. After thechange, thenewKing Vessavana sentword toalltrees
andshrubs andbushes andplants, bidding thetree-fairies each choose out
theabode that likedthem best. Inthose days theBodhisatta hadcome
tolifeasatree-foiry inaSal-forest intheHimalayas. Hisadvice tohis
kinsfolk inchoosiug their habitations wastoshun trees thatstood alone
intheopen, and totakeuptheir abodes allround theabode which he
hadchosen inthat Sal-forest. Hereon thewise ti-ee-fairies, following the
Bodhisatta's advice, took uptheir quarters round his tree. But the
foolish ones said,—"Why should wedwell intheforest? letusrather
seek outthehaunts ofmen, andtakeupourabodes outside villages,
towns, orcapital cities. For fairies who dwell insuch places receive
therichest offerings andthegreatest worship." Sotheydeparted tothe
haunts ofmen,andtookuptheirabode incertain giant treeswhich grew
inanopen space.
Now itfelloutupon adaythat amighty tempest swept over the
country. Naught did itavail thesolitary trees that years hadrooted
them deep inthe soilandthatthey were themightiest trees thatgrew.
Their bi'anches snapped;their stems were broken ;andthey themselves
were uprooted andflung toearth bythetempest. Butwhen itbroke on
theSal-forest ofinterlacing trees, itsfurywasinvain ;for,attack where
itmight, notatreecould itoverthrow.
Theforlorn fairies whose dwellings were destroyed, took their children
intheir arms andjourneyed totheHimalayas. There they told their
sorrows tothe fairies oftheSal-forest, [329]who inturn toldtheBodhi-
satta oftheir sadreturn. "Itwasbecause they hearkened nottothe
words ofwisdom, thattheyhave been brought tothis," saidbe ;andhe
unfolded thetruth inthisstanza :—
United, forest-like, should kinsfolk stand;Thestorm o'erthrows thesolitary tree.
Sospake theBodhisatta ;andwhen his lifewasspent, hepassed away

And theMaster went ontosay,"Thus, sire, reflect howmeet itisthat
knisfolk atanyrateshould beunited, andlovingly dwell together inconcord and
unity." Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying,"TheBuddha's

"Fajjunna, thimder !"—This story theMaster toldwhile atJetavana, abovit
therainhecaused tofell. For inthose days, soitissaid, there fellnorain in
Kosala ;thecrops withered;andeverywhere theponds, tanks, andlakes dried
up.Even thepoolofJetavana bytheembattled gateway ofJetavana gaveout;
andthetishandtortoises buried themselves inthemud. Thencame thecrows
andhawks with their lance-like beaks, andbusily picked them outwrithing and
wriggling, anddevoured them.
Ashemarked how thehshes andthetortoises were being destroyed, the
Master's heart wasmoved withcompassion, andheexclaimed, —"This day[330]
must Icause rain tofall." So,when thenight grew day, after attending tohis
bodily needs, hewaited till itwastheproper hour togotheroimd inquest of
alms, and then, girtround byahost oftheBrethren, and perfect with the
perfection ofaBuddha, hewent into Silvattlii foralms. Onhiswayback tothe
monastery intheafternoon from hisround foralms inSavatthi, hestoj^ped upon
thesteps leading down tothetank ofJetavana, andthus addressed theElder
Ananda:—"Bringmeabathing-dress, Ananda;forIwould bathe inthetank of
Jetavana." "But surely, sir,"replied theElder, "thewater isalldried up,and
onlymud isleft." "Great isaBuddha's power, Ananda. Go,bringmethe
bathing-dress," saidtheMaster. SotheElder went andbrought thebathing-
dress, which theMaster donned, using oneend togoround hiswaist, and
covering hisbodyupwith theother. Soclad, hetook hisstand upon thetank-
steps, andexclaimed,—"1would fainbathe inthetank ofJetavana."
That instant theyellow-stone throne ofSakka grew hotbeneath him,andhe
sought todiscover tliecause. Realising what wasthematter, hesummoned the
King oftheStorm-Glouds, andsaid, "TheMaster isstanding onthesteps ofthe
tank ofJetavana, andwishes tobathe. Make haste andpourdown rain ina
single torrent over allthekingdom ofKosala." Obedient toSakka's command,
theKing oftheStorm-Clouds cladhimself inonecloud asanunder garment,
andanother cloud asanouter garment, andchaunting therain-songi,hedarted
forth eastward. And lo !heappeared intheeast asacloud ofthebigness ofa
threshing-floor, which grew andgrew till itwasasbigasahundred, asa
thousand, threshing-floors ;andhethundered andlightened, andbending down
hisfaceandmouth deluged allKosala with torrents ofrain. Unbroken wasthe
downpour, quickly hlling thetank ofJetavana, andstopping onlywhen the
water was level with thetopmost step. Then theMaster bathed inthetank,
andcoming upoutofthewater donned histwoorange-coloured cloths and his
girdle, adjusting hisBuddha-robe around himsoastoleave oneshoulder bare.
Inthis guise hesetforth, surrounded bytheBrethren, andpassed into his
Perfumed Chamber, fragrant with sweet-smelling flowers. Here ontheBuddha-
seathesate,andwhen theBrethren hadperformed their duties, heroseand
exhorted theBrotherhood from thejewelled steps ofhisthrone,, anddismissed
them from hispresence. Passing nowwithin hisown sweet-smelling odorous
chamber, hestretched himself, lion-like, upon hisright side.
Ateven, theBrethren gathered together intheHall ofTruth, anddwelt on
theforbearance andloving-kindness oftheMaster. "When thecrops were
withering, when thepools were drying up,andthehshes and tortoises were in
grievous plight, then didheinhiscompassion come forth asasaviour. Donning
abathing-dress, hestood onthesteps ofthetank ofJetavana, and inalittle

whelm allKosala with itstorrents. Andbythetimehereturned totheMonastery,
hehadfreed allalikefrom their tribulations both ofmind andbody."
[331] Sorantheir talkwhen theMaster came forthfrom hisPerfumed Cham-
berintotheHall ofTruth, andasked whatwastheirtheme ofconversation ;and
they toldhim. "This isnotthe first time, Brethren," said theMaster, "that
theBlessed Onehasmade therain tofallinthehour ofgeneral need. Hedid
thelikewhen born intothebrute-creation, inthedayswhen hewasKing ofthe
Fish." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast:—
Once onatime, inthisselfsame kingdom ofKosala and atSavatthi
too,there wasapondwhere thetank ofJetavana now is,—apond fenced
inbyatangle ofclimbing plants. Therein dwelt theBodhisatta, who
hadcome tolifeasafishinthose days. And, then asnow, therewasa
drought intheland ;thecrops withered ;water gave outintankand
pool ;andthe fishes and tortoises buried themselves inthemud. Like-
wise,when thefishes and tortoises ofthispond hadhidden themselves in
itsmud, thecrows andother birds, flocking tothespot, picked them out
with their beaks anddevoured them. Seeing thefate ofhiskinsfolk, and
knowing thatnone buthecould savethem intheir hour ofneed, the
Bodhisatta resolved tomake asolemn Profession ofGoodness, andbyits
efficacy tomake rain fallfrom theheavens soastosave hiskinsfolk from
certain death. So,parting asunder theblack mud, hecame forth,—a
mighty fish,blackened withmud asacasket ofthe finest sandal-wood
which hasbeensmeared with collyrium. Opening hiseyeswhich were as
washen rubies, andlooking uptotheheavens hethusbespoke Pajjunna,
King ofDevas,—"My heart isheavy within meformykinsfolk's sake,
mygood Pajjunna. Howcomes it,pray, that,when Iwhoamrighteous am
distressed formykinsfolk, yousendnorainfrom heaven ?For I,though
bornwhere itiscustomary topreyonone's kinsfolk, have never frommy
youth updevoured any fish,even ofthesizeofagrain ofrice ;norhave
Ieverrobbed asingle living creature ofitslife.Bythetruth ofthismy
Protestation, Icallupon you tosend rainandsuccour mykinsfolk."
Therewithal, hecalled toPajjunna, King ofDevas, asamaster might
calltoaservant, inthisstanza:—[332]
Pajjunna, thunder !Baffle, thwart, thecrow!
Breed sorrow's pangs inhim ;easemeofwoe !
Insuch wise, asamaster might call toaservant, didtheBodhisatta
call toPajjunna, thereby causing heavy rains to falland relieving
numbers from thefear ofdeath. Andwhen his life closed, hepassed
away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

"Thevillage breeds nofearinvie."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while
atJetavana, about alay-brother who lived atSavatthi. Tradition saysthat this
man,whohadentered thePaths andwasanearnest believer, wasoncejourney-
ingalong onsome business orother inthecompany ofaleader ofacaravan;in
thejungle thecarts wereunyoked andalaager wasconstructed;andthegood
manbegan topaceupanddown atthefoot ofacertain treehardbythe
leader.
Now fivehundred robbers, whohadwatched their time,hadsurrounded the
spot,armed with bows, clubs, andother weapons, with theobject oflooting the
encampment. [333] Stillunceasingly thatlay-brother paced toand fro. "Surely
thatmust betheir sentry," saidtherobbers when they noticed him ;"wewill
wait tillheisasleep andthen lootthem." So,being unable tosurpiise the
camp, theystopped where they were. Still that lay-brother kept pacing toand
fro,—allthrough the firstwatch, allthrough themiddle watch, and allthrough
thelastwatch ofthenight. When daydawned, therobbers, whohadnever had
their chance, thi'ew down thestones andclubs which theyhadbrought, and
bolted.
Hisbusiness done, that lay-brother came back toSavatthi, and,approaching
theMaster, asked himthisquestion, "Inguarding themselves. Sir,domenprove
guardians ofothers?"
"Yes, lay-brother. Inguai'ding himself amanguards others;inguarding
others, heguards himself."
"Oh,how well-said, sir, isthisutterance oftheBlessed One !When Iwas
journeying with acaravan-leader, Iresolved toguard myself bypacing toand
froatthefootofatree,andbysodoing Iguarded thewhole caravan."
SaidtheMaster, "Lay-brother, inbygone days toothewiseandgoodguarded
others whilst guarding themselves." And, sosaying, atthelay-brother's request
hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeasabrahmin. Arriving atyears ofdiscretion,
hebecame aware oftheevils that spring from Lusts, and soforsook the

world toliveasarecluse inthecountry round theHimalayas. Need of
saltandvinegar having ledhim tomake apilgrimage foralms through
thecountryside, hetravelled inthecourse ofhiswanderings with a
merchant's caravan. When thecaravan halted atacertain spot inthe
forest, hepaced toand froatthefoot ofatree, hard bythecaravan,
enjoying thebliss ofInsight.
Now after supper jfivehundred robbers surrounded thelaager to
plunder it;but,noticing theascetic, they halted, saying, "Ifhesees us,
he'llgivethealarm;wait tillhedrops offtosleep, andthen we'llplunder
them." But allthrough thelivelong night the ascetic continued to
paceupanddown ;andnever achance didtherobbers get !Sothey
flungaway their sticks andstones andshouted tothecaravan-folk; —"Hi,
there!youofthecaravan !Ifithadn't been forthat ascetic walking about
under thetree,we'dhave plundered thelotofyou. Mind and fetehim
tomorrow!" And sosaying, theymade off.When thenight gave place to
light, thepeople .sawtheclubs and .stones which therobbers hadcastaway,
[334] andcame infearandtrembling toasktheBodhisatta with respectful
salutation whether hehadseen therobbers. "Oh, yes, Idid, sirs," he
replied. "And wereyounotalarmed orafraid atthesight ofsomany
robbers]" "No," saidtheBodhisatta; "the sight ofrobbers causes what
isknown asfearonly tothe rich. Asforme,—Iampenniless; why
should Ibeafraid ]Whether Idwell invillage orinforest, Inever have
any fear ordread." And therewithal, toteach them theTruth, he
repeated tliisstanza :—
The village breeds nofear inme;
Noforests medismay.
I'vewonbyloveandcharity
Salvation's perfect way.
When theBodhisatta hadthus taught theTruth inthis stanza tothe
people ofthecaravan, peace filled their hearts, andtheyshewed him
honour andveneration. Allhislifelonghedeveloped theFour Excellences,
andthenwasre-born intotheBrahma Realm.
Hislesson ended, theMaster shewed theconnexion andidentified theBirth
bysaying, "The Buddha's followers were thecaravan-folk ofthose days, and I
theascetic."

MAHASUPINA-JATAKA.
''Bulls first,and trees."—This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavaua
about sixteen wonderful dreams. For inthelastwatch ofonenight (sotra-
dition says) theKing ofKosala, whohadbeen asleep allthenight, dreamed
sixteen great dreams, [335] andwokeupingreat fright andalarm astowhat
theymight portend forhim. Sostrong wasthefearofdeath uponhimthathe
could not stir,butlaythere huddled uponhisbed. Now,when thenight grew
light, hisbrahmins andchaplains came tohimandwithdueobeisance asked
whether hismajesty hadslept well.
"How could Isleep well,mydirectors?" answered theking. "For just at
daybreak Idreamed sixteen wonderful dreams, and Ihave been interror ever
since !Tellme,mydirectors, what itallmeans."
"We shall beable tojudge, onhearing them."
Then theking toldthem hisdreams, andasked what those visions woidd
entail upon him.
Thebrahmins fell a-wringing their hands! "Why wring your hands,
brahmins?" asked theking. "Because, sire, these are evildreams." "What
willcome ofthem?" saidtheking. "One ofthree calamities, —harm toyour
kingdom, toyour life,ortoyour riches." "Isthere aremedy, oristhere not?"
"Undoubtedly these dreams inthemselves aresothreatening astobewithout
remedy ;butnone the lesswewill tindaremedy forthem. Otherwise, what
boots ourmuch study andlearning I""What thendoyoupropose todoto
avert theevil?" "Wherever fourroads meet, wewould offer sacrifice, sire."
"Aly directors," cried theking inhisterror, "my life isinyourhands; make
haste andworkmysafety." "Large sums ofmoney, andlarge supplies offood
ofevery kind willbeours," thought theexultant brahmins; and, bidding the
kinghavenofeai',theydeparted from thepalace. Outside thetown theyduga
sacrihcial pitand collected ahost offourfooted creatures, perfect andwithout
blemish, andamultitude ofbirds. But stillthey discovered something lacking,
andback theykeptcoming totheking toaskforthisthatandtheother. Now
their doings werewatched byQueen Mallika, whocame tothekingandasked
whatmade these brahmins keepcoming tohim.
"Ienvy you," saidtheking; "asnake inyour ear,andyounottoknow of
it!""What doesyour majesty mean?" "Ihave dreamed, ohsuch unlucky
dreams !Thebrahmins tellmethey point tooneofthree calamities ;andthey
areanxious tooffer sacrifices toavert the evil.And this iswhat brings them
here sooften." "But hasyourmajesty consulted theChiefBrahmin both ofthis
world andoftheworld ofdevas?" "Who, pray,mayhebe,mydear?" asked the
king. "Know younotthat chiefest personage ofalltheworld, theall-knowing
andpure, thespotless master-brahmin ?Surely, he,theBlessed One, willunder-
stand your dreams. Go,askhim." "And soIwill,myqueen," saidtheking.
Andaway hewent tothemonastery, saluted theMaster, andsatdown. "What,
pray, brings your majesty here soearly inthemorning?" asked theMaster in
hissweet tones. "Sir," said theking, "just before daybreak [336] Idreamed
sixteen wonderful dreams, which soterrified methat Itoldthem tothe
brahmins. They toldmethatmydreams boded evil,andthat toavert the
threatened calamity theymust offer sacrifice wherever fom-roads met.And so
they arebusywith their preparations, andmany living creatures have thefear
ofdeath before their eyes. But Ipray you,who arethechiefest personage in
theworld ofmenanddevas, youintowhose kencomes allpossible knowledge of
things pastandpresent and tobe,—Iprayyou tellmewhat willcome ofmy
dreams, Blessed One."

"True itis,sire,that there isnone other saveme,whocan tellwhat your
dreams signify orwhat willcome ofthem. 1will tellyou. Only first ofall
relate tomeyourdreams astheyappeared toyou."
"Iwill, sir,"saidtheking,andatoncebegan this list,following theorder of
thedreams' ajipearance:—
Bulls first,and trees, andcows, and calves,
Horse, dish, she-jackal, waterpot,
Apond, raw rice,andsandal-wood.
Andgourds that sank, andstones thatswam^.
With frogs thatgobbled upblack snakes,Acrow withgay-plumed retinue,
Andwolves inpanic-fear ofgoats!
"How was it,sir,that Ihadthefollowing oneofmydreams? Methought,

Thiswasmyfirstdream. What willcome ofitV
"Sire, thatdream shall havenoissue inyour days orinmine. Buthere-

theMaster hadthus toldthefulfilment ofthisdream, hesaid, "Tellmeyour

Thus didtheMaster expound theimjiort ofthese sixteen great dreams,
adding,—"You, sire,arenotthe first tohave these dreams; theyweredreamed
bykings ofbygone days also ;and,then asnow, thebrahmins found inthem a
pretext forsacrifices ;whereupon, attheinstance ofthewiseandgood, the
Bodhisatta wasconsulted, andthedreams wereexpounded bythem ofoldtime

injustthesamemanner astheyhavenowbeenexpounded." And sosaying, at
theking's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abralimin intheNorth country. When hecame
toyears ofdiscretion herenounced theworld forahermit's life;hewon
thehigher Knowledges andtheAttainments, anddwelt intheHimalaya
country inthebliss thatcomes from Insight.
Inthose days, injust thesame manner, Brahmadatta dreamed these
dreams atBenares, andenquired ofthebrahmins concerning them. And
thebrahmins, then asnow, settowork atsacrifices. Amongst themwas
ayoung brahmin oflearning andwisdom, apupil oftheking'.s chaplain,
whoaddressed hismaster thus :—"Master, youhave taught metheThree
Vedas. Isthere nottherein atextthatsays'The slaying ofonecreature
giveth not lifetoanother'?" "My son, thismeans money tous,agreat
deal ofmoney. You onlyseem anxious tospare theking's treasury!"
"Do asyou will, master," saidtheyoung brahmin; "asforme,towhat
endshall Itarry longer herewithyou 1"And sosaying, helefthim,and
betook himself totheroyal pleasaunce.
That selfsame day the Bodhisatta, knowing all this, thought to
himself:—"If Ivisi-itto-day thehaunts ofmen, Ishall work thedeliver-
ance ofagreat multitude from their bondage." So,passing through the
air,healighted intheroyal pleasaunce andseated himself, radiant asa
statue ofgold, upon theCeremonial Stone. Theyoung brahmin drew
near and with dueobeisance seated himself bytheBodhisatta inall
friendliness. Sweet converse passed ;andtheBodhisatta asked whether
theyoung brahmin thought theking ruled righteously. "Sir,"answered
theyoung man, "the king isrighteous himself; butthebrahmins make
him sidewith evil. Being consulted bytheking astosixteen dreams
which hehaddreamed, thebrahmins clutched attheopportunity for
sacrifices [34-1:] and settowork thereon. Oh, sir,would itnotbeagood
thing thatyoushould offer tomakeknown totheking therealimport of
hisdreams andsodeliver great numbers ofcreatures from theirdreadf
"But,myson, Idonotknow theking, norheme. Still, ifheshould
come hereandaskme,Iwill tellhim." "Iwillbring theking, sir," said
theyoung brahmin ;"ifyouwillonlybesogood astowait hereaminute
tillIcome back." Andhaving gained theBodhisatta's consent, hewent
before theking, and saidthat there hadalighted intheroyal pleasaunce
anair-travelling ascetic, who saidhewould expound theking's dreams;
would nothismajesty relate them tothisascetic ?

dreams. "Certainly, sire," saidtheBodhisatta ;"but first letmehear
thedreams asyoudreamed them." "Readily, sir,"answered theking;
andhebegan asfollows :—
Bulls first,and tree.s, andcows, and calves.
Horse, dish, she-jackal, waterpot,
Apond, raw rice,andsaiulal-wood.
Andgourds that sank, andstones thatswam,—
andsoforth, ending uj)with
And wolves inpanic-fear ofgoats.
And hismajesty went ontotellhisdreams injust thesamemanner as
that inwhich King Pasenadi haddesci'ibed them. [345]
"Enough," saidtheGreat Being; "you have nothing tofearordread
from allthis." Having thus reassured theking, andhaving freed agreat
multitude from bondage, theBodhisatta again took \iphisposition inmid-
air,whence heexhorted theking and established him intheFive
Commandments, ending with these words:—"Henceforth, Oking, join
notwith thebi-ahmins inslaughtering animals forsacrifice." Histeach-
ingended, theBodhisatta passed straight through theairtohisown
abode. And theking, remaining stedfast intheteaching heliadheard,
passed away after alifeofalms-giving andother good works tofare
according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said,"You have nothing tofearfrom these
di'eams; away with the sacrifice!" Having had the sacrifice removed, and
having saved thelives ofamultitude ofcreatures, heshewed theconnexion and
identified theBirth bysaying, "Ananda wastheking ofthose days, Sariputta

"Both squint."- -This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana, about
amiserly LordHigh Treasurer. Hard bythecityofRajagaha, aswearetold,
wasatownnamed Jagghery, andheredwelt acertain LordHigh Treasurer,
known asthe^Millionaire Miser, whowasworth eighty crores! Notsomuch as
thetiniest drop ofoilthatablade ofgrass willtake up,didheeither giveaway
orconsume forhisownenjoyment. Bohemade nouseofallhiswealth either
forhisfamily orforsages andbrahmins :itremained unenjoyed, —likeapool
haunted bydemons. Now, itfelloutonadaythat theMaster arose atdawn
moved with agi'eat compassion, andashereviewed those ripe forconversion
throughout theuniverse, hebecame aware that thisTreasurer with hiswife
some fourhundred milesaway were destined totread thePaths ofSalvation.
Now thedaybefore, theLordHigh Treasurer hadgone hiswaytothepalace
towaitupon theking,andwasonhishomeward waywhen hesawacoimtry-
bumpkin, whowasquiteempty within, eating acake stuffed with gruel. The
sight awoke acraving within him !But, arrived athisown house, [346] he
thought tohimself,— "If Isay Ishould likeastuffed cake, awhole host of
people willwant tosharemymeal ;andthatmeans getting through ever so
much ofmyriceandgheeandsugar. Imustn't sayaword toasoul." Sohe
walked about, wrestling with hiscraving. Ashour after hour passed, hegrew
yellower andyellower, andtheveins stood outlikecords onhisemaciated frame.
Unable atlast tobear itanylonger, hewent tohisownroom andlaydown
hugging hisbed. But stillnotawordwould hesaytoasoul forfearofwasting
hissubstance !Well, hiswifecame tohim, and,stroking hisback, said :"What
isthematter, myhusband^"
"Nothing," said he."Perhaps thekinghasbeen cross toyou?" "No, he
hasnot." "Have your children or.servants done anything toannoy you?"
"Nothing ofthat kind, either." "Well, then, haveyouacraving foranytliing?"
But stillnotawordwould hesay,—allbecause ofhispreposterous fearthathe
might waste hissubstance; but laythere speechless onhisbed. "Speak,
husband," saidthewife; "tellmewhatyouhave acraving for." "Yes," saidhe
with agulp, "Ihave gotacraving foronething." "And what isthat,my
husband?" "Ishould likeastuffed cake toeat!" "Now whynothave said so
atonce ?You're richenough !I'llcook cakes enough tofeast thewhole town
ofJagghery." "Why trouble about them? Theymustwork toearn theirown
meal." "Well then, I'llcook onlyenough forourstreet." "How richyouare!"
"Then, I'llcook justenough forourownhousehold." "How extravagant you
areI""Very good, I'llcookonlyenough forourchildren." "Why bother about
them?" "Very good then, I'llonlyprovide forourtwo selves." "Why should
youbeinit?" "Then, I'llcook justenough foryoualone," saidthewife.
"Softly," saidtheLordHigh Treasurer; "there arealotofpeople onthe
watch forsigns ofcooking inthis place. Pick outbroken rice,—being careful to
leave thewhole grain,—andtakeabrazier andcooking-pots andjustavery little
milkandgheeandhoney andmolasses ;thenupwithyoutotheseventh story
ofthehouse anddothecooking upthere. There Iwill sitalone andundis-
turbed toeat."
Obedient tohiswishes, thewifehad allthenecessary things carried up,
climbed allthewayupherself, senttheservants away, anddespatched word to
theTreasurer tocome. Upheclimbed, shutting andbolting door after door as
heascended, tillatlasthecame totheseventh floor, thedoor ofwhich healso
shut fast. Then hesatdown. Hiswife litthe fireinthe bi-azier, puther
poton,andsetabout cooking thecakes.

196 TheJataka. Booh I.
Now intheearly morning, the ]\Iaster hadsaid totheElder Great Mog-
gallana,—"Moggallana, thisMiser Millionaire [347] inthetown ofJagghery near
Rajagaha, wanting toeatcakes himself, issoafraid ofletting others know, that
heishaving them cooked forhim rightupontheseventh story. Gothither;
convert theman toself-denial, andbytranscendental power transport husband
and wife, cakes, milk, gheeand all,here toJetavana. Thisday Iandthefive
hundred Brethren willstay athome, and Iwillmake thecakes furnish them
with ameal."
Obedient totheMaster's bidding, theElder bysupernatural power passed to
thetown ofJagghery, andrested inmid-air before thechamber-window, duly
clad inhisunder andouter cloths, bright asajewelled image. Theunexpected
sight oftheEldermade theLordHigh Treasurer quake with fear. Thought he
tohimself, "Itwas toescape such visitors that Iclimbed uphere: andnow
there's oneofthem atthewindow !"And, failing torealise thecomprehension of
thatwhich hemust needs comprehend, hesputtered with rage, likesugar and
saltthrown onthe fire,ashebiu'st outwith—"What willyou get,sage,byyour
simply standing inmid-air? Why, youmaypaceupanddown tillyou've made
apath inthepathless air,—andyetyou'll stillgetnothing."
TheElder began topace toandfroinhisplace intheair!"What willyou
getbypacing toandfro?" saidtheTreasurer! "Youmay sitcross-legged in
meditation inthe air,—but still you'll getnothing." TheElder satdown with
legscrossed !Then said theTreasurer, "What willyougetbysitting there ?
Youmaycome andstand onthewindow-sill ;buteven thatwon't getyouany-
thing!" TheElder took hisstand onthewindow-sill. "What willyougetby
standing onthewindow-sill? Why, youmay belch smoke, andyetyou'll still
getnothing!"saidtheTreasurer. Then theElder belched forthsmoke tillthe
whole palace was filled with it.TheTreasurer's eyesbegan tosmart asthough
pricked with needles ;and, forfearatlastthat hishouse might besetonfire,he
checked himself fromadding—"You won't getanything even ifyouburst into
flames." Thought hetohimself, "This Elder ismost persistent! Hesimply
won't goaway empty-handed !Imust have justonecake given him." Sohe
said tohiswife,"My dear, cookone little cakeandgive ittothesage togetrid
ofhim."
Soshemixed quite alittledough inacrock. Butthedough swelled and
swelled till itfilled thewhole crock, andgrew tobeagreat bigcake! "What a
lotyoumust haveused!"exclaimed theTreasurer atthesight. Andhehimself
with thetipofaspoon took avery little ofthedough, andputthat intheoven
tobake. Butthat tinypiece ofdough grew larger than the firstlump ;and,one
after another, every piece ofdough hetookbecame ever sobig !Then helost
heart and said tohiswife,"You givehimacake, dear." But, assoon asshe
tookonecakefrom thebasket, atonce alltheother cakes stuck fasttoit.So
shecried outtoherhusband that allthecakes hadstuck together, andthatshe
could notpartthem.
"Oh, I'llsoon ptirtthem," said he,—butfound hecould not!
Then husband andwifebothtookhold ofthemass ofcakes atthecorner and
tried togetthem apart. Buttugasthey might, they couldmake nomore
impression together than they didsingly, onthemass. Now astheTreasurer
waspulling away atthecakes, heburst intoaperspiration, and hiscraving left
him. Then saidhetohiswife,"Idon'twant thecakes;[348] givethem, basket
and all,tothis ascetic." Andsheapproached theElder with thebasket inher
hand. Then theElder pi-eached thetruth tothe pair, andproclaimed the
excellence oftheThree Gems. And, teaching that giving wastrue sacrifice, he
made thefruits ofcharity andother goodworks toshine forth even asthefull-
moon intheheavens. WonbytheElder's words, theTreasurer said, "Sir,come
hither and sitonthiscouch toeatyour cakes."
"Lord High Treasurer," said theElder, "the All-Wise Buddha with five
hundred Brethren sitsinthemonastery waiting ameal ofcakes. Ifsuch be
yourgood pleasure, Iwould askyoutobring your wifeandthecakes with you,
and letusbegoing totheMaster." "But where, sir, istheMaster atthepresent

time?" "Five andforty leagues a\Yay, inthemonastery atJetavana." "How-
arewetogetallthatway, sir,without losing alongtimeontheroad?" "If it
beyour pleasure, Lord High Treasurer, Iwilltransport youthither bymy
transcendental powers. Thehead ofthestaircase inyour house shall remain
where itis,butthebottom shall beatthemain-gate ofJetavana. Inthiswise
will Itransport you totheMaster inthetimewhich ittakes togodownstairs."
"Sobeit,sir,"saidtheTreasurer.
Then theElder, keeping thetopofthestaircase where itwas,commanded,
saying,—"Let thefootofthestaircase beatthemain-gate ofJetavana." And
soitcame topass !InthiswaydidtheElder transport theTreasurer and his
wife toJetavana quicker thantheycould getdown thestairs.
Then husband andwifecame before theMaster andsaidmeal-time hadcome.
And theMaster, passing into theRefectory, satdown ontheBuddha-seat
prepared forhim, with theBrotherhood gathered round. Then theLordHigh
Treasurer poured theWater ofDonation over thehands oftheBrotherhood
with theBuddha atitshead, whilst hiswifeplaced acake inthealms-bowl of
theBlessed One. Ofthishetookwhat sufficed tosupport life,asalsodidthefive
hundred Brethren. Next theTreasurer wentround ottering milkmixed withghee
andhoney andjagghery ;andthe]\Iastcr andtheBrotherhood brought theirmeal
toaclose. Lastly theTreasurer andhiswife atetlieir fill,but stillthereseemed
noendtothecakes. Evenwhen alltheBrethren andthescrap-eaters through-
outthemonastery had allhadashare, still there wasnosign oftheend
approaching. Sothey toldtheMaster, saying, "Sir,thesupply ofcakes gi'ows
nosmaller."
"Then throw themdown bythegreat gate ofthemonastery."
Sotheythrew them away inacave notfarfrom thegateway ;and tothis
dayaspot called 'The Crock-Cake,' isshown attheextremity ofthat cave.
TheLord High Treasurer and hiswifeapproached andstood before the
Blessed One,whoreturned thanks ;andattheclose ofhiswords ofthanks, the
pairattained Fruition oftheFirst Path ofSalvation. Then, taking their leave
oftheMaster, thetwomounted thestairs atthegreat gateandfound themselves
intheirownhome once more. [349] Afterwards, theLordHigh Treasurer
lavished eighty crores ofmoney solely ontheFaith theBuddha taught.
NextdaythePerfect Buddha, returning toJetavana after around foralms
inSavatthi, delivered aBuddha-discourse totheBrethren before retiring tothe
seclusion ofthePerfumed Chamber. Atevening, theBrethren gathered together
intheHall ofTruth, andexclaimed, "How great isthepower oftheElder
Moggallana !Inamoment heconverted amiser tocharity, brouglit himwith
thecakes toJetavana, sethimbefore theMaster, andstablished him insalva-
tion.How great isthepower oftheElder!"Asthey sattalking thus ofthe
goodness oftheElder, theMaster entered, and,onenquiry, was told ofthe
subject oftheir talk. "Brethren," said he,"aBrother who istheconverter ofa
household, should apj^roach that household without causing itannoyance or
vexation,—even asthebeewhen itsucks thenectar from theflower; insuch
wise should hedraw nigh todeclare theexcellence oftheBuddha." And in
praise oftheElder Moggallana, herecited thisstanza :—
Like bees, thatharm noflower's scent orhue
But, laden with itshoney, flyaway,
So,sage, within thyvillage walk thywayi.
Then, tosetforth stillmore theElder's goodness, hesaid,—"This isnotthe
firsttime, Brethren, thatthemiserly Treasurer hasbeen converted byMoggal-
lana. Inother days tootheElder converted him,andtaught himhowdeeds
andtheir effects arelinked together." Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.

198 TheJdtaka. Booh I.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, there
wasaTreasurer, lUlsa byname, whowasworth eighty crores, andhad all
thedefects which falltothelotofman.Hewaslameandcrook-backed
andhadasquint ;hewasanunconverted infidel, andamiser, never giving
ofhisstore toothers, norenjoying ithimself ;hishouse was likeapool
haunted bydemons. Yet, forseven generations, hisancestors hadbeen
bountiful, giving freely oftheir best ;but,when hebecame Treasurer, he
broke through thetraditions ofhishouse. Burning down thealmonry and
driving thepoorwithblows from hisgates, hehoarded hiswealth.
Oneday,when hewasreturning Irom attendance ontheking, hesaw
ayokel, whohadjourneyed farandwasa-weary, seated onabench, and
filling amugfrom ajarofrank spirits, anddrinking itoff,withadainty
moi'sel ofstinking dried-fish asarelish. The sightmade theTreasurer
feelathirst for s^iirits, buthethought tohimself, [3.50]"IfIdrink,
others willwant todrink with me,andthatmeans aruinous expense."
Sohewalked about, keeping histhirst under. But, astimewore oji,he
could dosonolonger ;hegrew asyellow asoldcotton;andtheveins
stood outonhissunken frame. Onaday, retiring tohischamber, he
laydown hugging hisbed. Hiswifecame tohim,andrubbed hisback,
assheasked, "What hasgone amiss withmylord 1"
(What follows istobetold inthewords oftheformer stoi-y.) But,
when she inherturn said,"Then I'llonlybrew liquor enough for
you," hesaid, "Ifyoumake thebrew inthehouse, there willbemany on
thewatch;and tosend out forthe spirits and sitanddrink ithere,
isoutofthequestion." Soheproduced onesingle penny, andsent a
slave tofetchhimajarofspirits from thetavern. When theslavecame
back, hemade himgofrom thetown totheriverside andputthejar
down inaremote thicket. "Now beoff!" said he,andmade theslave
waitsome distance off,while hefilled hiscupand fell to.
Now theTreasurer's father, who forhischarity andother goodworks
hadbeen re-born asSakka intheRealm ofDevas, was atthatmoment
wondering whether hisbounty was stillkeptupornot,andbecame aware
ofthestopping ofhisbounty, andofhisson's behaviour. Hesawhow
hisson,breaking through the traditions ofhishouse, hadburnt the
almonry totheground, haddriven thepoor with blows from hisgates,
andhow, inhismiserliness, fearing toshare with others, that sonhad
stolen away toathicket todrink byhimself. Moved bythesight, Sakka
cried, "Iwillgotohimandmakemysonseethatdeeds must have their
consequences; Iwillwork hisconversion, andmake him charitable and
worthy ofre-birth intheRealm ofDevas." Sohecamedown toearth,
andoncemore trod theways ofmen, putting onthesemblance ofthe
Treasurer Illlsa, with the latter's lameness, andcrookback, and squint.
Inthis guise, heentered thecityofRajagaha andmade hisway tothe


No. 78. 199
palace-gate, where hebade hiscoming beannounced totheking. "Let
him approach," said theking ;andheentered and stood with due
obeisance before hismajesty.
"What brings youhere atthisunusual hour, LordHigh Treasurer]"
saidtheking. "Iamcome, Sire,because Ihave inmyhouse eighty crores
oftreasure. Deign tohave them carried tofilltheroyal treasury."
"Nay,myLord Treasurer; [351] thetreasure withinmypalace isgreater
than this." "Ifyou, sire, willnothave it,Ishall give itaway towhom I
will." "Dosobyallmeans, Treasurer," saidtheking. "Sobeit,sire,"
said thepretended Illisa, aswith dueobeisance hedeparted from the
presence totheTreasurer's house. Theservants allgathered round him,
butnotonecould tellthat itwasnottheir real master. Entering, he
stood onthethreshold andsent fortheporter, towhom hegave orders
that ifanybody resembling himself should appear andclaim tobemaster
ofthehouse they should soiindly cudgel such aoneandthrow him out.
Then, mounting thestairs totheupper story, hesatdown onagorgeous
couch andsent forlUisa's wife.When shecame hesaidwith asmile,
"Mydear, letusbebountiful."
Atthese words, wife, children, andservants allthought, "It'salong
time since hewas thiswayminded. Hemust have been drinking tobe
sogood-natured andgenerous to-day." And hiswife said tohim, "Beas
bountiful asyou please, myhusband." "Send forthe crier," said he,
"and bidhimproclaim bybeat ofdrum allthrough thecitythateveryone
whowants gold, silver, diamonds, peai-ls, andthe like, istocome tothe
house ofIllisa theTreasurer." His wife didashebade, andalarge
crowd soon assembled atthedoor carr3'ing baskets and sacks. Then
Sakka bade thetreasure-chambers bethrown open, and cried, "This ismy
gift toyou ;takewhat you willandgoyour ways." And thecrowd
seized ontheriches there stored, andpiledthem inheaps onthefloorand
tilled thebagsandvessels theyhadbrought, andwent offladen with the
spoils. Among them wasacountryman whoyoked Illlsa's oxen toIllTsa's
carriage, filled itwith theseven things ofprice, andjourneyed outofthe
cityalong thehighroad. Ashewent along, hedrew near thethicket,
andsang theTreasurer's praises inthese words:—"Mayyou livetobea
hundred, mygood lord IllTsa !What youhavedone formethisdaywill
enable metolivewithout doing another sti'oke ofwork. Whose were
these oxenl—yours. Whose was this carriage?—yours. Whose the
wealth inthecarriage"?—yours again. Itwasnofather ormother who
gavemeallthis ;no,itcame solely from you,mylord."
These words filled theLordHigh Treasurer with fearandtrembling.
"Why, thefellow ismentioning myname inhistalk," saidhetohimself.
"Can thekinghave been distributing mywealth tothepeople?" [352]
Atthebai-ethought hebounded from thebush, and, recognizing hisown


200 TheJdtaka. Booh I.
oxen aud cart, seized theoxen bythecord, crying, "Stop, fellow; these
oxenand thiscartbelong tonie."Down leaped themanfrom thecart,
angrily exclaiming, "You rascal! Illisa, theLord High Treasurer, is
giving away hiswealth toallthecity.What hascome toyou 1"Andhe
sprang attheTreasurer andstruck himontheback likeafalling thunder-
bolt,andwent offwith the cart. Illisa picked himself up,trembling i»
every limb, wiped offthemud, andhurrying after hiscart, seized hold of
it.Again thecountryman gotdown, and seizing Illisa bythehair,
doubled himupandthumped himabout thehead forsometime;then tak-
inghimbythethroat, heflunghimback thewayhehadcome, anddrove
off. Sobered bythisrough usage, Illisa hurried offhome. There, seeing
folkmaking offwith thetreasure, hefelltolaying hands onhere aman
andthere aman, shrieking, "Hi! what's this? Istheking despoiling
me?"And everymanhelaidhands onknocked himdown. Bruised
andsmarting, hesought totakerefuge inhisownhouse, when theporters
stopped him with, "Holloa, you rascal !Where inight youbegoing 1"
And firstthrashing himsoundly with bamboos, they took their master by
thethroat andthrew himoutofdoors. "There isnone buttheking left
toseemerighted," groaned Illisa, andbetook himself tothe palace.
"Why, ohwhy, sire," hecried, "have youplundered melikethis?"
"Nay, itwasnot I,myLord Treasurer," said theking. "Did you
notyoiirself comeanddeclare your intention ofgiving your wealth away,
ifIwould notaccej^t it?And didyounotthen sendthecrierround and
carry outyour threat?""Ohsire,indeed itwasnotIthatcame toyou
onsuchanerrand. Your majesty knows hownearand close Iam,and
howInever giveaway somuch asthetiniest drop ofoilwhich ablade of
grass willtake up.May itplease your majesty tosend forhimwhohas
givenmysubstance away, andtoquestion himonthematter."
Then theking sent forSakka. And soexactly alike were thetwo
that neither theking norhiscourt could tellwhich wastherealLord
High Treasurer. Said themiser Illisa, "Who, and what, sire, isthis
Treasurer? /am theTreasurer."
"Well, really Ican't saywhich isthereal Illisa," saidtheking. "Is
there anybody whocandistinguish them forcertain?" "Yes, sire,my
wife." Sothewifewas sent forandasked which ofthetwowasher
husband. And shesaidSakka washerhusband andwent tohisside.
[353] Then inturn Illlsa's children andservants were brought inand
asked thesame question ;and allwith oneaccord declared Sakka wasthe
realLordHigh Treasurer. Here itflashed across Illlsa's mind thathe
hadawartonhishead, hidden among hishair, theexistence ofwhich was
known only tohisbarber. So,asalastresource, heasked that hisbarber
might besent fortoidentify him.Now atthistime theBodhisatta was
hisbarber. Accordingly, thebarber wassent forandasked ifhecould


No. 78. 201
distinguish the realfrom the fal^e llHsa. "Icould tell, sire," said he,
"ifImight examine their heads." "Then look atboth their heads,"
saidtheking. Ontheinstant Sakka caused awart toi-iseonhishead !
After examining thetwo,theBodhisatta reported that, asboth alike had
gotwarts ontheir heads, hecouldn't forthe lifeofhimsaywhich wasthe
realman. And therewithal heuttered thisstanza:—
Both squint ;both halt;bothmen arehunchbacks too;
And both have warts alike !1cannot tell
Which ofthetwothereal lillsa is.
Hearing hislasthope thus failhim, theLordHigh Treasurer fellintoa
tremble ;andsuchwas hisintolerable anguish atthe lossofhisbeloved
riches, thatdown hefellinaswoon. Thereupon Sakka jjutforth his
transcendental powers, and, rising inthe air,addressed theking thence
inthese words: "Not IllTsaam I,Oking, butSakka." Then those
around wiped Illlsa's faceanddashed water over him. Recovering, he
rose tohisfeetandbowed totheground before Sakka, King ofDevas.
Then saidSakka, "IllTsa, mine was thewealth, notthine; Iamthy
father, andthou artmyson. Inmylifetime Iwasbountiful toward the
poorand rejoiced indoing good;wherefore, Iamadvanced tothishigh
estate andambecome Sakka. But thou, walking not iiimyfootsteps,
artgrown aniggard andaverymiser; thou hastburntmyalmonry to
theground, driven thepoorfrom thegate,andhoarded thy I'iches. Thou
hastnoenjoyment thereof thyself, norhasanyotherhuman being; [354]
butthy stoi-e isbecome likeapoolhaunted bydemons, whei-eat noman
may slake histhirst. Albeit, ifthou wiltrebuild minealmonry andshow
bounty tothepoor, itshall beaccounted tothee forrighteousness. But,
ifthou wilt not,then will Isti'ip thee ofallthatthou hast,andcleave thy
headwith thethunderbolt ofIndra, andthou shalt die."
Atthisthreat IllTsa, quaking forhis life, cried out, "Henceforth I
willbebountiful." AndSakka accepted hispromise, and, stillseated in
mid-air, established hissonintheCommandments andpreached theTruth
tohim,departing thereafter tohisownabode. And IllTsa wasdiligent in
almsgiving andother good works, andsoassured hisre-birth thereafter in
heaven.
"Brethren," saidtheMaster, "this isnotthe firsttime thatMoggallana has
converted themiserly Treasurer ;inbygone days toothesamemanwascon-
verted byhim." Hislesson ended, heshewed theconnexion and identified the
Birth bysaying, "This miserly Treasurer wasthelUlsa ofthose days,Moggallana
wasSakka, King ofDevas, Ananda wastheking,and Imyself thebarber."

"y/egaoe therubbers time."—This story was told liytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about acertain Minister. He, 'tissaid, ingratiated himself with the
king, and, after collecting theroyal revenue inaborder-village, privily arranged
with aband ofrobbers thathewould march themen offinto thejungle,
leaving the\illage fortherascals toplunder,—oncondition thattheygavehim
halfthebooty. Accordingly, atdaybreak when theplacewas leftunprotected,
downcame therobbers, whoslewandatethecattle, looted thevillage, andwere
offwith their booty before hecame back atevening with hisfollowers. But it
wasa\'ery short time before hisknavery leaked outandcame totheearsofthe
king. And theking sent forhim, and, ashisguilt was manifest, hewas
degraded andanother headman put inhisplace. Then thekingwent tothe
Master atJetavana andtoldhimwhat hadhappened. "Sire," saidtheBlessed
One, "theman hasonlyshewn thesame disposition nowwhich heshewed in
bygone days." Then attheking's request hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta Avas reigning inBenares, he
api)ointed acertain Minister tobeheadman ofaborder-village ;andevery-
thingcame topass asintheabove case.Now inthose days theBodhisatta
wasmaking theround oftlieborder- villages inthewayoftrade, [355] and
hadtaken uphisabode inthatvery village. Andwhen theheadman was
marching hismenback atevening withdrums a-beating, heexclaimed,
"This scoundrel, who privily egged ontherobbers tolootthe village, has
waited tilltheyhadmade offtothejungle again, andnowback hecomes
withdrums a-beating,—feigning ahappy ignorance ofanything wrong
having happened." And, sosaying, heuttered thisstanza:—
Hegave therobbers time todrive andslay
The cattle, burn thehouses, captm-e folk;And then withdrums a-beating, home hemarched,—Asonnomore, forsuch ason isdead^.
Insuch wise didtheBodhisatta condemn theheadman. Notlong
after, thevillany wasdetected, andtherascal waspunished bytheking
ashiswickedness deserved.

"This isnotthe first time, sire," saidtheking, "that hehasbeeu ofthis

"Yoaoaiuded your j»/Yj;^;r'.s.s."— This story was told l)ytheMaster while at

"there's nofamily sonolile asmine, nolineage sopeerless. Iamascion of
thehighest ofprincely lines; noman ismyequal inbirth orancestral e.state;
there isabsolutely noendtothegoldand silver andother treasures wepossess.
Ourvery slaves andmenials arefedonriceandmeat-stews, andareclad inthe
bestBenares cloth, with thechoicest Benares perfumes toperfimie themselves
withal ;—whilst I,because 1have joined theBrotherhood, [3.36] have tocontent
myself with this vilefareandthis vilegarb."
Butanother Brother, aftei- enquiring into hisfamily estate, exposed tothe
Brethren theemptiness ofthis pretension. SotheBrethren met intheHall
ofTi'uth, andtalkbegan astohow that Brother, inspite ofhisvows toleave
worldly things andcleave only tothesaving Truth, wasgoing about deluding
theBrethren with hislying boasts. A\'hilst thefellow's sinfulness wasbeing dis-
cussed, theMaster entered andenquired what their topic was.Andthey told
him. "This isnotthe first time. Brethren," saidtheMaster, "that hehasgone
about boasting; inbygone days toohewent about boasting anddeluding
people." And sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin inamarket-to w^nintheNorth country,
andwhen hewa.sgrown uphestudied under ateacher ofworld-wide fame
atTakkasila. There helearnt theThree Vedas andtheEighteen Branches
ofknowledge, andcompleted hiseducation. Andhebecame known asthe
sage Little Bowman. Leaving Takkasila, hecame totheAndhra country
insearch ofpractical exj^erience. Now, itliap])ened that inthisBirth the
Bodhisatta wassomewhat ofacrooked little dwarf, and liethought to
himself, "IfImakemyappearance before anyking, he'ssure toaskwhat

personality?" Sohebetook himself totheweavers' quarter, and there
espying ahuge weaver named Bhimasena, saluted him,asking theman's
name. "Bhimasena' ismyname," saidtheweaver. "Andwhatmakes a
finebigman likeyouwork atsosorry ati-adel" "Because Ican't geta
living anyother way." "Weave nomore, friend. Thewhole continent
canshewnosuch archer asIam ;butkings would scornmebecause Iam

with thebow,andtheking willtakeyouinto hispay[357] andmake you
plyyour calling regularly. Meantime Ishall bebehind you toperform
theduties that arelaidupon yoii,andsoshall earnmyliving inyour
shadow. Inthismanner weshallboth ofusthrive andprosper. Only do
asItellyou." "Done with you," saidtheother.
Accordingly, theBodhisatta took theweaver withhim toBenares,
acting asalittle page ofthebow,andputting theother inthefront ;and
when theywere atthegates ofthepalace, hemade himsendword ofhis
coming totheking. Being summoned into theroyal presence, thepair
entered together andbowing stood before theking. "What brings you
here?" saidtheking. "1amamighty archer," saidBhimasena; "there is
noarcher likemeinthewhole continent." "What paywould youwant
toentermyservice?" "Athousand pieces afortnight, sire.""What is
thisman ofyours 1""He'smylittle page, sire." "Very well, entermy
service."
SoBhimasena entered theking's service;but itwastheBodhisatta who
didallhiswork forhim.Now inthose days there w^asatiger inaforest
inKasi which blocked afrequented high-road andhaddevoured many
victims. When thiswasreported totheking, hesent forBhimasena and
asked whether hecould catch thetiger.
"How could Icallmyself anarcher, sire, ifIcouldn't catch atiger?"
Thekinggavehim largesse andsenthimontheerrand. Andhome to
theBodhisatta came Bhimasena with thenews. "All right," said the
Bodhisatta; "away yougo,myfriend." "But areyounotcoming too?"
"No, Iwon't go;but I'lltellyoualittle plan." "Please do,myfriend."
"Well don'tyouberashandapproach the tiger's lair alone. What you
willdoistomuster astrong band ofcountryfolk tomarch tothespotwith

bevery frightened andbribe youheavily nottoreport them totheking;
you willbecredited with slaying thetiger ;andtheking toowillgiveyou

"Very good," saidBhimasena ;and offhewentandslew thetiger just
astheBodhisatta had toldhim. Having thusmade theroad safe for
travellers, back hecame with alarge following toBenares, andsaid tothe
king, "Ihave killed thetiger, sire ;theforest issafe fortravellers now."
Well-pleased, theking loaded himwith gifts.
Another day, tidings came that acertain roadwas infested with a
buffalo, andthekingsentBhimasena tokill it.Following theBodhisatta's
directions, hekilled thebuffalo inthesamewayasthetiger, andreturned
totheking,whooncemore gavehim lotsofmoney. Hewasagreat lord
now. Intoxicated byhisnew honours, hetreated theBodhisatta with
contempt, andscorned tofollow hisadvice, saying, "Icangetonwithout
you.Doyouthink there's nomanbutyourself?" Thisandmany other
harsh things didhesaytotheBodhisatta.
Now, afewdays later, ahostile king marched upon Benares and
beleaguered it,sending amessage tothekingsummoning him either to
surrender hiskingdom ortodobattle. And theking ofBenares ordered
Bhimasena outtofighthim. SoBhimasena wasarmed ca])-a-pie insoldierly
fashion andmounted onawar-elephant sheathed incomplete armour. And
theBodhisatta, whowasseriously alarmed thatBhimasena might getkilled,
armed himself capa-pie alsoandseated himself modestly behind Bhimasena.
Surrounded byahost, theelephant passed outofthegates ofthecityand
arrived intheforefront ofthebattle. Atthe first notes ofthemartial
drum Bhimasena fella-quaking with fear.•'Ifyou falloffnow, you'll get
killed, "said theBodhisatta, andaccordingly fastened acordround him,which
heheld tight, toprevent himfrom falling offtheeleijhant. Butthesight
ofthefield ofbattle proved toomuch forBhimasena, andthefear ofdeath
wassostrong onhimthathefouled theelephant's back. "Ah," saidthe
Bodhisatta, "thepresent doesnottally with thepast. Then youaffected
thewarrior;nowyourprowess isconfined tobefouling theelephant you
rideon."And sosaying, heuttered thisstanza:—
[359]Youvaunted your prowess, andloudwasyour boast;
Youswore youwould vanquish thefoe!
But isitconsistent, when faced with their host.
Toventyour emotion, sir,so?
When theBodhisatta hadended these taunts, hesaid, "Butdon'tyou
beafraid, myfriend.AmnotIhere toprotect you 1"Then hemade
Bhimasena get ofl'theelephant andbadehimwash himself andgohome.
"And now towinrenown thisday," said theBodhisatta, raising his

camp, hedragged theking outandtookhim alive toBenares. Ingreat
joyathisprowess, hisroyal master loaded himwith honours, andfrom
thatdayforward allIndia wasloud with thefame oftheSage Little
Bowman. ToBhTmasena hegave lai'gesse, andsenthimback tohisown
home ;whilst heliimself excelled incharity and allgood works, andat
hisdeath passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
"Thus, Brethren," said theMaster, "this isnotthe firsttime that this
Brother hasbeen abraggart ;hewasjustthesame inbygone days too." His
lesson ended, theMaster shewed theconnexion and identified theBirth by
saying, "This braggart Brother wastheBhTmasena ofthose days, and Imyself

SURAPANA-JATAKA.
[360]"Wedranl:"—Th\H story was toldbytheMaster about theElder
Sagata, while hewasdwelling intheGhosita-park nearKosambl.
For, afterspending therainy season attSavatthi, theMaster hadcome onan
alms-pilgrimage toamarket-town named Bhaddavatika, where cowherds and
goatherds andfarmers andwayfarers i-espectfully besought himnottogodown
totheMango Ferry; "for," said they, "intheMango Ferry, inthedemesne of
thenaked ascetics, dwells apoisonous anddeadly Naga,known astheNaga of
theMango Ferry, whomight harm theBlessed One." Feigning nottohear
them, though they repeated their warning thrice, theBlessed Oneheldonhis
way. Whilst theBlessed Onewasdwelling nearBhaddavatika inacertain
grove there, theElder Sagata, aservant oftheBuddha, whohadwonsuch
supernatural powei's asaworldling canpossess, went tothedemesne, i)iled a
couch ofleaves atthespotwhere theNaga-king dwelt, andsatehimself down
cross-legged thereon. Being unable toconceal hisevilnature, theNaga raised
agreat smoke. SodidtheElder. Then theNaga sent forth flames. Sotoo
didtheElder. But, whilst theNaga's flames didnoharm totheElder, the
Elder's flames diddoharm totheNaga, andsoinashort timehemastered the
Naga-king andestablished him intheRefuges andtheCommandments, after
which herepaired back tothe ]\Iaster. And theMaster, after dwelling aslong
asitpleased himatBhaddavatika, went ontoKosambl. Now thestory ofthe
Naga's conversion bySagata, hadgotnoised abroad allover thecountryside,
andthetownsfolk ofKosambl went forth tomeet theBlessed Oneandsaluted
him, afterwhich theypassed totheElder Sagata andsaluting him, said, "Tell
us, sir,what you lackandwewillfurnish it."TheElder himself remained


No. 81. 207
silent; butthefollowers oftheWicked Six*made answer asfollows:—"Sirs, to
those whohave renounced theworld, white spirits areasrare asthey are
acceptable. Doyouthink youcould gettheElder some clear white spirit?"
"To besurewecan," saidthetownsfolk, andinvited theMaster totake his
meal withthem next day. Then theywent back totheirowntown and
arranged that each inhisownhouse should offer clear white spirit tothe
Elder, andaccordingly they alllaid inastore and invited theElder inand
pliedhimwith theliquor, house byhouse. Sodeep were hispotations that,
onhiswayoutoftown, theElder fellj)rostrate inthegateway andthere lay
hiccoughing nonsense. Onhiswayback from hismeal inthetown, theMaster
came ontheElder lying inthis state, andbidding theBrethren carry Sagata
home, [361] passed onhisway tothe pai'k. TheBrethren laidtheElderdown
with hishead attheBuddha's feet,butheturned round sothathecame tolie
with hisfeettowards tlieBuddha. Then theMaster asked hisquestion,
"Brethren, doesSagata show that respect towards menowthatheformerly did?"
"No, sir." "Tell me.Brethren, who itwasthatmastered theNaga-king ofthe
Mango Feriiy?" "ItwasSagata, sir." "Think youthat inhispresent state
Sagata could master even aharmless water-snake?" "That hecould not, sir."
"Well now. Brethren, isitproper todrink thatwhich, when drunk, steals away
aman's senses?" "It isimproper, sir." Now, after discoursing with the
Brethren indispraise oftheElder, theBlessed One laid itdown asaprecept
thatthedrinking ofintoxicants wasanoffence re(iuiring confession andabsolu-
tion;afterwhich heroseupandpassed into hisperfumed chamber.
Assembling together intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren discussed thesinof
spirit-drinking, saying, "What agreat sin isthedrinking ofspirits, sirs,seeing
that ithasblinded totheBuddha's excellence even onesowiseand sogifted
asSagata." Entering theHall ofTruth atthis i)oint, theMaster asked what
topic theywere discussing;andthey toldhim. "Brethren," said he,"this isnot
the firsttime thattheywhohadrenounced theworld have lost their senses
through drinking sijirits;theverysame thing took place inbygone days."
And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahniadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoanortliern brahmin-family inKasi ;andwhen
hegrew up,herenounced tlioworld for tlie lieiinit's life.Hewonth^
Higher Knowledges and tlieAttainments, anddwelt inthe enjoy-
ment ofthe bliss ofInsight intheHimalayas, with fivehundred pupils
around him. Once,when therainy season hadcome, hispupils said to
him, "Master, maywegotothehaunts ofmenandbring back salt
andvinegar?" "Formyown part, .sirs, Ishall remain here; butyou
may goforyour health's sake, andcome backwhen therainy season
isover."
"V'ery good," saidthey, andtaking arespectful leave oftheir master,
came toBenares, where theytookuptheir abode intheroyal pleasaunce.
Onthemorrow theywent inquest ofalms toavillage just outside the
city gates, where tlieyhadplenty toeat ;andnextdaytheymade their
wayintothecity itself. Thekindly citizens gave-alms tothem, andthe
kingwassooninformed that fivehundred hermits from theHimalayas had

208 Tlie Jcltaka. Book I.
taken uptheirabode iutheroyal pleasaunce, andthattheywere ascetics
ofgreat austerity, subduing the flesh,andofgreat virtue. Hearing this
good character ofthem, thekingwent tothepleasaunce andgraciously
made themwelcome [362] tostaythere forfourmonths. They promised
thattheywould, andthenceforth were fedintheroyal palace andlodged in
tliepleasaunce. Butonedayadrinking festival washeld inthecity,and
thekinggave thefivehundred hermits alarge supply ofthebest spirits,
knowing thatsuch things rarely come intheway ofthosewhorenounce
theworld and itsvanities. The ascetics drank theliquor andwentback
tothepleasaunce. There, indrunken hilarity, some danced, some sang,
whilst others, wearied ofdancing andsinging, kicked about their rice-ham-
persandother belongings,—after which they laydown tosleep. When
tlieyhad slept offtheirdrunkenness andawoke toseethetraces oftheir
revelry, theyweptandlamented, saying, "Wehavedone thatwhich we
ought nottohave done.Wehave done this evilbecause weareaway
from ourmaster." Forthwith, they quitted thepleasaunce andreturned
totheHimalayas. Laying aside their bowls andother belongings, they
saluted their master andtook their seats. "Well,mysons," said he,
"were youcomfortable amid thehaunts ofmen, andwere youspared
weary journey ings inquest ofalms? Didyoudwell inunity onewith
another?"
"Yes, master, wewere comfortable; butwedrank forbidden drink, so
that, losing our senses and forgetting ourselves, weboth danced and
sang." And byway ofsetting thematter forth, theycomposed and
repeated thisstanza :—
Wedrank, wedanced, wesang,wewept ;'twas well
That, whenwedrank thedrink that steals away
The senses, wewere nottransformed toapes.
"This iswhat issure tohappen totliosewho arenotliving under
amaster's care," saidtheBodhisatta, rebuking those ascetics ;andhe
exhorted them saying, "Henceforth, never dosuch athing again."
Living onwith Insight unbroken, hebecame destined torebirth there-
after intheBrahma Realm.
[.363] Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth (and henceforth we
shallomit thewords 'sliewed theconnexion'), bysaying,—"My disciples were
thebandofhermits ofthose days,and Itheir teacher."

about aconcupiscent Brother. Tradition saystherewasascion ofagood family
whogave hisheart totheBuddha's doctrine andjoined theBrotherhood. Butone
day ashewasgoing hisround foralms inSavatthi, hewasthere stirred to
concupiscence bythesight ofabeautifully dressed woman. Being brought by
histeachers anddirectors before theMaster, headmitted inanswer totheen-
quiries oftheBlessed Onethatthespirit ofconcupiscence hadentered intohim.
Then saidtheMaster, "Verily thefivelusts ofthesenses aresweet inthehour
ofactual enjoyment, Brother; butthisenjoyment ofthem (inthat itentails
themiseries ofre-birth inhellandtheother evil states) isliketheeating
ofthefruit oftheWhat-fruit tree. Very fairtoview isthe"What-fruit, very
fragrant andsweet ;butwhen eaten, itracks theinwards andbrings death. In
other da^'s, through ignorance [368] ofitsevilnature, amultitude ofmen, seduced
bythebeauty, fragrance andsweetness ofthefruit, atethereof sothatthey died."
Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once upon atimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta came tolifeastheleader ofacaravan. Oncewhen journeying
with fivehundred cartsfrom East toWest, hecame totheoutskirts ofa
forest. Assembling hismen, hesaid tothem:—"Inthis forest grow
trees that bear poisonous fruit. Letnoman eatanyunfamiliar fruit
without firstasking me."When theyhadtraversed theforest, theycame
attheother border onaWhat-fruit treewith itsboughs bending lowwith
their burthen offruit. Inform, smell and taste, itstrunk, boughs, leaves
and fruit resembled amango. Taking the tree, from itsmisleading
appearance andsoforth, tobeamango, some plucked thefruitandate;
butothers said, "Letusspeak toourleader before weeat."And these
latter, plucking thefruit, waited forhim tocome up.When hecame, he
ordered them toflingaway thefruit theyhadpkicked, andhadanemetic
administered tothose whohad already eaten. Ofthese latter, some
recovered;butsuch ashadbeen the first toeat, died. TheBodhisatta
reached hisdestination insafety, and sold hiswares ataprofit, after
which hetravelled home again. After alifespent incharity andother
good works, hepassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

never attain inthis life,whilst Iremain alayman, living inthemidst ofsinful
pleasures. Wherefore, thisveryday Iwould faingototheMaster atJetavana
andrenounce theworld fortheBrotherhood. Grant lueyour leave, sire." The
King consenting, thebrahmin setoutforJetavana. Hisfriends andrelations in
abody tried toturnhimfrom hispurpose, but,finding their efi'orts ofnoavail,
lefthim alone. Hecame totheIMaster andasked tobeadmitted totheBrother-
hood. After admission tothelower andhigher orders, hewonbyapplication
si)iritual insight andbecame anArahat, whereon hedrew near totheMaster,
saying, "Sir,myjoining theOrder hasborne theSupreme Fruit,"—thereby
signifying thathehadwonArahatship. Hearing ofthis,theBrethren, assembling
intheHall ofTruth, spoke withoneanother ofthevirtues oftheKing's chaplain
who tested hisownreputation forgoodness andwho, leaving theKing, hadnow
risen tobeanArahat. Entering theHall, theMaster asked what theBrethren
were discussing, andthey toldhim. "Not without aprecedent. Brethren," said
he,"istheaction ofthisbrahmin inputting tothetest hisreputation for
goodness andinworking outhissalvation after renouncing theworld. The like
wasdonebythewiseandgood ofbygone days aswell." And sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta was hischaplain,—aman given tocharity andother good
works, whose mind was setonrighteousness, always keeping unbroken
theFiveCommandments. And theKing honoured himbeyond theother
brahmins ;andeverything came topass asabove.
But, astheBodhisatta wasbeing bi'ought inbonds before theKing,
hecame where some snake-charmers were exhibiting asnake, which they
laid hold ofbythe tailand the throat, and tiedround their necks.
Seeing this, theBodhisatta begged themen todesist, forthesnake might
bitethem and cut their lives short. "Brahmin," replied thesnake-
charmers, "this isagoodandwell-behaved cobra ;he'snotwicked like
you,who foryour wickedness andmisconduct arebeing hauled offin
custody."
Thought theBodhisatta tohimself, "Even cobras, ifthey donotbite
orwound, arecalled 'good.' Howmuch moremust thisbethecasewith
thosewhohavecome tobehuman beings !Verily itisjust thisgoodness
which isthemost excellent thing inalltheworld, nor[371] doesaught
surpass it."Then hewasbrought before theKing. "What isthis,my
friends'?" said theKing. "Here's athiefwhohasbeen robbing your
majesty's treasury." "Away withhim toexecution." "Sire," saidthe
brahmin, "Iamnothief." "Then howcame you totake themoney?"
Hereon theBodhisatta made answer precisely asabove, ending asfollows:—
"This then iswhy Ihavecome totheconclusion that itisgoodness which
isthehighest andmost excellent thing inalltheworld. Butbethat as
itmay, yet,seeing that thecobra, when itdoesnotbiteorwound, must
simply becalled 'good' andnothing more, forthis reason too itis

goodness alone which isthehighest andmost excellent ofallthings,"
Then inpraise ofgoodness heuttered thisstanza :—
Naught cancompare withGoodness; alltheworld
Cannot itsequal show. Thecobra fell,
Ifmenaccount it'good,' issaved from death.
After preaching thetruth totheKing inthis stanza, theBodhisatta,
abjuring allLusts, andrenouncing theworld forthehermit's life,repaired
totheHimalayas, where heattained tothefiveKnowledges andthe
eight Attainments, earning forhimself thesurehope ofi-e-birth thereafter
intheBrahma Kealm.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "My disciples
were theKing's following inthose days,and Imyself theKing's chaplain."

"What areyoudoing, young brahmin?" asked theMaster.

wherefore myfather, fearing thataservant might covet andretain theclothes,

young man's very eyes, regardless ofthelatter's earnest warnings and re[)eated
entreaties tohim not totakethem; andhedeparted inthedirection of

Home inallhaste rantheyoung brahmin, totellhisfather howtheSage
Gotama haddeclared that theclothes would just suit him,'andhad persisted,
inspite ofallwarnings tothecontrary, intaking tliesuitaway withhimtothe

When hecameupon tlieMaster hestood respectfully ononesideandspoke thus,—"Is itindeed true, asIhear, thatyou,mygoodGotama, [373] picked upasuit
ofclothes inthecharnel-ground?" "Quite true,brahmin." "MygoodGotama,
that suit isaccursed ;ifyoumake useofthem, they willdestroy you. Ifyou

replied theMaster, "byopen profession Ihaverenounced theworld, andam

stitions inbygone days, aswell asatthepresent time." Sosaying, atthe
brahmin's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime there reigned inthecityofRajagaha, inthekingdom
ofMagadha, arighteous King ofMagadha. Inthose days theBodhisatta
came tolifeagain asabiahmin oftheNorth-west. Growing up,he
renounced theworld forthehermit's life,won theKnowledges andthe
Attainments, andwent todwell intheHimalayas. Onone occasion,
returning from theHimalayas, andtaking uphisabode intheKing's
pleasaunce, hewent onthesecond day into thecity tocollect alms.
Seeing hira, theKing hadhimsummoned into thepalace and there
provided with aseatandwith food,—exacting apromise fromhimthat
hewould takeuphisabode inthepleasaunce. SotheBodhisatta used to

Now inthose days there dwelt inthat city abrahmin known as
Cloth-omens. Andhehadinachest asuitofclothes which weregnawed
bymice, andeverything came topass just asintheforegoing story. But
when thesonwasonhiswaytothecharnel-ground theBodhisatta gotthere
firstandtook hisseat atthegate; and, picking upthesuitwhich the
young brahmin threw away, hereturned tothepleasannce. When the
sontold this totheoldbrahmin, thelatter exclaimed, "It willbethe
deatli oftheKing's ascetic"
:andentreated theBodhisatta tothrow that
suitaway, lestheshould perish. Buttheascetic replied, "Good enough
forusaretherags that areflung away incharnel-grounds. Wehave
nobelief insuperstitions about luck,which arenotapproved byBuddhas,
Pacceka Buddhas, orBodhisattas ;andtherefore nowisemanought to

forsook hiserrors andtook refuge intheBodhisatta. And theBodhisatta,
preserving hisInsight uul)roken, earned re-birth thereafter intheBrahma
Realm. [374.]
Having told this story, theMaster, asBuddha, taught theTruth to
thebrahmin inthisstanza:—•
Whoso renounces omens, dreams and signs.
That man, from sui)erstition's errors freed,
Shall trium})li o'erthepaired Depravities
And o'erAttachments totheend uftime.
When theMaster hadthuspreached hisdoctrine tothebrahmin intheform

"Hoiv plausible." This story was toldbytheMaster while atJetavana
about aknave. Thedetails ofhisknavery willberelated intheUddrda-jataka^.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, there
lived hardbyacertain little village ashifty rascal ofanascetic, ofthe
class which wears long, matted hair. The squire oftheplace hada
hermitage built intheforest forhim todwell in,andused toprovide
excellent fareforhiminhisown house. Taking thematted-haired rascal
tobeamodel ofgoodness, andliving ashedidinfearofrobbers, thesquire
brought ahundred pieces ofgold tothehermitage andthere buried them,
bidding theascetic keepwatch over them. "Noneed tosaythat, sir,to
amanwhohasrenounced theworld ;wehermits never covet other folks'
goods." "It iswell, sir," saidthesquire, whowent offwith fullconfidence
intheother's protestations. Then therascally ascetic thought tohimself,
"there's enough here [376] tokeep aman allhis lifelong." Allowing a
fewdays toelapse first,heremoved thegoldandburied itbythewayside,
returning todwell asbefore inhishermitage. Next day, after ameal of
rice atthesquire's house, theascetic said, "It isnowalong time, sir,
since Ibegan tobesupported byyou ;and tolivelong inoneplace
islike living intheworld,—which isforbidden to})rofe8sed ascetics.
Wherefore Imust needs depart." Andthough thesquire pi-essed him to
stay, nothing could overcome thisdetermination.

"Well, then, ifitmust beso,goyour way, sir," said thesquire ;and
heescorted theascetic totheoutskirts before helefthim. After going a
littlewaytheascetic thought that itwould beagood thing tocajole the
squire ;so,putting astraw inhismatted hair, back heturned again.
"What brings youback?" asked thesquire. "Astraw fromyour roof,
sir,hadstuck inmyhair ;and, aswehermits may nottakeanything
which isnotbestowed upon us,Ihavebrought itback toyou." "Throw it
down, sir,andgoyour way," said the squire, whothought tohimself,
"Wliy, hewon't take somuch asastraw which doesnotbelong tohim !
What asensitive nature!" Highly delighted with theascetic, thesquire
badehim farewell.
Now atthattime itchanced that theBodhisatta, whowasonhisway
totheborder-district fortrading purposes, hadhalted forthenight at
that village. Hearing what theascetic said, thesuspicion wasaroused in
hismind that therascally ascetic must have robbed thesquire ofsome-
thing;andheasked thelatter whether hehaddeposited anything inthe
ascetic's care.
"Yes,—ahundred pieces ofgold."
"Well, justgoandseeifit'sallsafe."
Away went thesquire tothehermitage, andlooked, andfound his
money gone. Running back totheBodhisatta, hecried, "It'snotthere."
"The thief isnone other than that long-haired rascal ofanascetic," said
theBodhisatta; "letuspursue andcatch him." Soaway they hastened
inhotpursuit. When theycaught therascal theykicked andcuffed him,
tillhediscovered tothem where hehadhidden themoney. When he
procured thegold, theBodhisatta, looking at it,scornfully remarked
totheascetic, "Soahundred pieces ofgold didn't trouble your conscience
somuch asthatstraw!" Andherebuked him inthisstanza :—
How plausible thestory that therascal told !
How heedful ofthestraw !How heedless ofthegold !
[377]When theBodhisatta hadrebuked thefellow inthis wise, he
added,—"Andnowtake care,you hypocrite, thatyoudon't playsuch a
trick again." When his lifeended, theBodhisatta passed away tofare
thereafter according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said,"Thus you .see,Brethren, that thisBi'other
wasasknavish inthepast asheisto-day." And heidentified theBirth by
saying, "This knavish Brother wastheknavish ascetic ofthose days, and Ithe

"Tlieman ungratefid." —This storywastoldbytheMaster while atJctavana,
about Aiiatha-pindika.
Ontheborders, sothetale goes, there lived amerchaut, whowasacorre-
spondent and afriend ofAnatha-pindika's, buttheyhadnever met. There
uaine atimewhen thismerchant loaded livehundred carts with local produce
andgave orders totliemen incharge togotothegreat merchant Anatha-
pindika, andbarter thewares inhiscorrespondent's shop fortheir vtilue, and
bring back thegoods received inexchange. Sotheycame toSavatthi, and
found Anatha-pindika. First making him apresent, they toldhim their
bu.siness. "You arewelcome," saidthegreat man, andordered them tobe
lodged there andprovided withmoney fortlieir needs. After kindly encjuiries
after their master's health, hebartered their merchandise andgavethem the
goods inexchange. Then theywent back totheirown district, andreported
whathadhappened.
Shortly afterwards, Anatha-pindika similarly despatched fivehundred carts
with merchandise tothevery district inwhich they dwelt ;and hispeople,
when they had gotthere, went, present inhand, tocallupon theborder
merchant. "Where doyoucome from'/" said he."From Sfwatthi," replied
they; "from your correspondent, Anatha-pindika." "Anyone can callhimself
Anatha-pindika," saidhewith asneer; andtaking their present, hebadethem
begone, giving them neither lodging nordouceur. Sothey bartered theirgoods
forthemselves andbrought back thewares inexchange toSavatthi, with the
story ofthereception theyhadhad.
Now itchanced [378] that thisborder merchant despatched another caravan
oflivehundred carts toSavatthi ;and hispeople came with apresent intheir
hands towaitupon Anatha-pindika. But, assoon asAnatha-pindika's people
caught sight ofthem, they said,"Oh, we'll see, sir,thatthey arepropeiiy lodged,
fed,andsupplied withmoney foi-their needs." Andthey took thestrangers
outside thecityandbadethem imyoke their carts atasuitable spot, adding
that riceandadouceur would come from Anatha-pindika's house. About the
middle watch ofthenight, having collected aband ofserving-men and slaves,
they looted thewhole caravan, carried offevery garment themenhad got,
drove away their oxen, andtook thewheels offthe carts, leaving thelatter
butremoving thewheels. Without somuch asashirtamong thelotofthem,
the terrified stivmgers s})edaway andmanaged toreach theirhome onthe
border. Then Anatha-pindika's jjeople toldhimthewhole story. "This capital

told ittotheMastei*.
"This isnotthe first time, sir,"saidtheMaster, "that thisborder merchant

"He bolts thedie."—This story was toldbythe IVIaster while atJetavana,
about using things thoughtlessly.
Tradition says thatmost oftheBrethren ofthatdaywere inthehabit of
using robesandsoforth, which were given them, inathoughtless manner. And
their thoughtless useoftheFour Requisites asarulebarred their escape from
thedoom ofre-birth inhellandtheanimal world. Knowing this,theMaster set
forth thelessons ofvirtue andsliewed thedanger ofsuch thoughtless useof
things, exhorting them tobecareful intheuseoftheFour Requisites, and
laying down this rule,"The thoughtful Brother hasadefinite object inview
when hewears arobe, namely,, tokeep offthecold." After laying down similar
rules fortheother Requisites, heconcluded bysaying, "Such isthethoughtful
usewhich should Ijemade oftheFour Requisites. Thoughtlessly tousethem
isliketaking deadly poison ;andthere were those inbygone dayswhothrough
their thoughtlessness didinadvertently "take poison, totheir exceeding hurt in
dueseason." Sosaying hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into awell-to-do family, andwhen hegrew up,he
became adice-player. With himused toplay asharper, whokept on
playing while hewaswinning, but,when luck turned, broke upthegame
byputting oneofthedice inhismouth andpretending itwas lost,—after
which hewould takehimself off. ['^'"^O]"Very good," saidtheBodhisatta

when herealised what wasbeing done; "we'll look into this." Sohe
tooksome dice, anointed them athome with poison, dried them carefully,
andthen carried them withhim tothesharper, whom hechallenged toa
game. The other was willing, thedice-board wasgotready, andplay
began. Nosooner didthesharper begin tolosethan hepopped oneof
thedice into hismouth. Observing him inthe act,theBodhisatta
remai'ked, "Swallow away; you willnot failtofindoutwhat itreally is
inalittle time." Andheuttered thisstanza ofrebuke :
Hebolts thediequite boldly,—knowing not
What bm'uing poison thereon lurks unseen.—Aye, bolt it,sharper! Soon you'll burn within.
Butwhile theBodhisatta wastalking away, thejjoison began towork on
thesharper ;hegrew faint, rolled hiseyes,andbending double with pain
felltotheground. "Now," saidtheBodhisatta, "Imust savetherascal's
life." Sohemixed some simples andadministered anemetic until
vomiting ensued. Then headministered adiaught ofghee withhoney
andsugar andother ingredients, andbythismeans made thefellow all
right again. Then heexhorted himnottodosuch athing again. After
alifespent incharity andother good woi'ks, theBodhisatta passed away
tofarethereafter according tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "Brethren, thethoughtless useofthings
islikethethoughtless taking ofdeadly poison." Sosaying, heidentified the
Birth inthese words, "Iwasmyself thewiseandgoodgambler ofthose days."

about thevenerable Ananda.
Once thewives oftheKing ofKosala thought among themselves, asfollows,

come hereandteach usthetruth. Letuslearn whatwecanfrom him,and
becharitable anddogood works, totheendthatwemay profit byourhaving
beenborn atthishai)py juncture." Sothey allwent inabody totheKing, and
toldhimwhatwasintheirminds ;andtheKing gave hisconsent.
Now itfelloutonadaythat theKing wasminded totake hispleasure in
theroyal pleasaunce, andgave orders that thegrounds should bemade ready
forhiscoming. Asthegardener wasworking away, heespied theIMaster seated
atthefoot ofatree. Sohewent totheKing and said,"The pleasaunce is
made ready, sire ;buttheBlessed One issitting there atthefoot ofatree."
"Very good," saidtheKing,"we willgoandhear theMaster." Mounting his
chariot ofstate, hewent totheMaster inthepleasaunce.
Now there wasthen .seated attheMaster's feet, listening tohisteaching,
alay-brother named Chattapani, whohad entered theThird Path. On
cjitching sight ofthis lay-brother, theKing hesitated ;but,onreflection that
thismust beavirtuous man, orhewould notbesitting bytheMaster for
instruction, heapproached andwith abow seated himself ononeside ofthe
Master. OutofI'everence forthesupreme Buddha, thelay-brother neither rose
intheKing's honour norsaluted hismajesty; and thismade theKing very
angry. Noticing theKing's displeasure, theMaster proceeded toextol the
merits ofthat lay-brother, saying, "Sire, this lay-brother ismaster ofall
tradition;heknows byheart thescriptures thathave beenhanded down ;and
hehassethimself freefrom tliebondage ofpassion." "Surely," thought the
King, "liewhose praises theMaster istelling canbenoordinary person."
Andhesaid tohim,"Letmeknow, lay-brother, ifyouareinneed ofanything."
"Thank you," saidtheman. Then theKing listened totheMaster's teaching,
andatitsclose roseupandceremoniously withdrew.
Another day,meeting thatsame lay-brother going after breakfast umbrella
inhand toJetavana, theKing hadhimsummoned tohispresence and said,
"Ihear, lay-brother, thatyouareaman ofgreat learning. Nowmywives are
veryanxious tohearandlearn thetruth ;Ishould beglad ifyouwould teach
them." "It isnotmeet, sire,that alayman [382] should expound orteach the
truth intheKing's harem;that istheprerogative oftheBrethren."
Recognising theforce ofthisremark, theKing, after dismissing thelayman,
called hiswives together andannounced tothem hisintention ofsending tothe
Master foroneoftheBrethren tocome astheir instructor inthedoctrine. Which
oftheeighty chief disciples would theyhave ?After talking itover together,
theladies with oneaccord chose Ananda^ theElder, surnamed theTreasurer of
theFaith. SotheKing went totheMaster andwithacourteous greeting sat
down byhisside, afterwhich heproceeded tostate hiswives' wish, andhisown
hope, thatAnanda might betheir teacher. TheMaster, having consented to
sendAnanda, theKing's wives nowbegan toberegularly taught bytheElder
andtolearn from him.
Onedaythejewel outoftheKing's turban wasmissing. When theKing
heard ofthelosshesent forhisministers andbadethem seize everyone who
had access totheprecincts and findthejewel. SotheMinisters searched
everybody, women and all,forthemissing jewel, tilltheyhadworried everybody
almost outoftheir lives;butnotrace ofitcould they find. ThatdayAnanda
came tothe palace, only tofind theKing's wives asdejected astheyhad
hitherto been delighted when hetaught them. "What hasmade you likethis

Taking theseat setforhim, theElder asked whether itwastrue that his
majesty had losthisjewel, "(^uite true, sir,"saidtheKing. "And can itnot
befound?" "Ihavehad alltheinmates ofthepalaces worried outoftheir
lives, andyet Ican't find it.""There isoneway, sire, tofind it,without
worrying people outoftheir lives." "What way isthat, sir?" "By wisp-giving,
sire." "Wisp-giving? Whatmay tliat be,pray?" "Call together, sire, allthe
pei'sons you suspect, and privately giveeach oneofthem separately awisp

day, wellandgood. Ifnot,thesame thing must bedone onthesecond and
third "days. Inthisway, alarge numbei' of])ersons willescape worry, andyou

Following theabove counsel, theKing caused thestraw andclaytobedealt
outforthree successive days; butyetthejewel wasnotrecovered. [383]On
thethird daytheElder came again, andasked whether thejewel hadbeen
brought back. "No, sir," saidtheKing. "Then, sire,youmust have alarge

filled with water andascreen putupbefore it.Then give orders that all

back." With thisadvice theElder departed. AndtheKing didashebade.
Thought the thief,"Ananda hasseriously taken thematter inhand; and, if
hedoes notfindthejewel, he'llnot letthings rest here. Thetime hasreally
come togivethejewel upwithout more ado." Sohesecreted thejewel about
hisperson, andgoing behind thescreen, dropped itinthewater before hewent
away. When everyone hadgone, thepotwas em]>tied, andthejewel found.
"It's allowing totheElder," exclaimed theKing inhisjoy,"that Ihave gotmy
jewel back,andthatwithout worrying ahost ofpeople outoftheir lives." And
allthepersons about theprecincts were equally grateful toAnanda forthe
trouble hehadsaved them from. The storyhowAnanda's marvellous powers
hadfound thejewel, spread through allthecity, till itreached theBrotherhood.
Said theBrethren, "The great knowledge, learning, andcleverness oftheElder
Ananda havebeen themeans atonce ofrecovering thelostjewel andofsaving
many jiersons from being worried outoftheir lives." And asthey satetogether
intheHall ofTruth, singing thepraises ofAnanda, theMaster entered and
asked thesidjject oftheir conversation. Being told,hesaid, "Brethren, this is
notthe firsttime thatwhat hadbeen stolen hasbeen found, nor isAnanda the
onlyonewhohasbrought about such adiscovery. Inbygone days toothewise
andgood discovered whathadbeen stolen away, andalsosaved ahost ofpeople
from troulile, shewing that the lost proi)erty had fallen into thehands of
animals." Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta, having perfected hiseducation, became one oftheKing's
ministers. OnedaytheKing with alarge following went into his
]jleasaunce, and, after walking about thewoods, feltadesire todisport
himself inthewater. Sohewentdown into theroyal tank and sent
forhisharem. Thewomen ofthehai'em, removing thejewels from their
heads andnecks andsoforth, laidthem aside with their upper gai*ments
inboxes under thecharge offemale slaves, andthenwentdown into

thewater. 'Now, asthequeen wastaking offherjewels andornaments,
andlaying them with herupper I'obeonabox, shewaswatched bya
female monkey, whicli washidden inthebranches ofatreehard by.
Conceiving alonging towear thequeen's pearl necklace, thismonkey

and satonguard over her spoils asdemurely asthough nothing had
happened. Byandbytheslave awoke, and, terrified atfinding the
jewels gone,sawnothing else todobut toscream out,"Amanhasrun
offwith thequeen's pearl necklace." Uprantheguards from every side,
andhearing thisstory told ittotheKing. "Catch thethief," said his
majesty;andaway went theguards searching highandlowforthethief
inthepleasaunce. Hearing thedin,apoor superstitious rustic' took to
hisheels inalarm. "There hegoes," cried theguards, catching sight of
therunaway; andthey followed himuptillthey caught him,andwith
blows demanded what hemeant bystealing such precious jewels.
Thouglit he,"IfIdeny thecharge, Ishall diewith thebeating I
shall getfrom these ruflSans. I'dbetter sayItook it."Soheconfessed
tothetheftandwashauled offaprisoner totheKing. "Did youtake
those precious jewels?" asked theKing. "Yes, your majesty." "Where
aretheynow?" "Please your majesty, I'mapoorman; I'venever in
my lifeowned anything, even abedorachair, ofanyvalue,—much less
ajewel. ItwastheTreasurer whomademetake thatvaluable necklace;
andItook itandgave ittohim.Heknows allabout it."
Then theKing sent fortheTreasurer, andasked whether therustic
hadpassed thenecklace ontohim. "Yes, sire,"wastheanswer. "Where
isitthen?" "Igave ittoyour majesty's Chaplain." Then theChaplain
wassent for,and interrogated inthesame way.And hesaidhehad
given ittotheChief Musician, who inhisturn saidhehadgiven ittoa
courtesan [385] asapresent. But she,being brought before theKing,
utterly denied everhaving received it.
Whilst the fivewere thus being questioned, thesun set. "It's too
latenow," saidtheKing; "we willlook into thisto-morrow." Sohe
handed thefiveover tohisministers andwent back intothe city. Here-
upon theBodhisatta fella-thinking. "These jewels," thought he,"were
lostinside thegrounds, wliilst therustic wasoutside. There wasastrong
guard atthegates, and itwasimpossible foranyone inside togetaway
1Orperhaps "ataxpaying ryot."

with thenecklace. Idonotseehowanyone, whether inside orout,conld
havemanaged tosecure it.Thetruth isthispoorwretched fellow must
have saidhegave ittotheTreasurer merely inorder tosave hisown
skin ;andtheTreasurer must have saidhegave ittotheChaplain, in
thehope thathewould get oflf ifhecould mix theChaplain upinthe
matter. Further, theChaplain must have saidhegave ittotheChief
Musician, because hethought thelatter would make thetime passmerrily
inpi'ison;whilst theChief Musician's object inimplicating thecourtesan,
wassimply tosolace himself with hercompany during imprisonment.
Notoneofthewhole fivehasanything todowith the theft. Onthe
other hand, thegrounds swarm withmonkeys, andthenecklace musthave
gotintothehands ofoneofthefemale monkeys."
When hehadarrived atthis conclusion, theBodhisatta went tothe
King with therequest that thesuspects might behanded over tohim
andthathemight beallowed toexamine personally into thematter.
"By allmeans, mywise friend," saidtheKing;"examine into it."
Then theBodhisatta sent forhisservants and toldthem where to
lodge thefive prisoners, saying, "Keep strict watch overthem ;listen to
everything they say,andreport italltome"And hisservants didashe
badethem. Astheprisoners sattogether, theTreasurer saidtotherustic,
"Tell me,youwretch, where youand Ievermetbefore thisday ;tellme
when yougavemethat necklace." "Worshipful sir," saidtheother, "it
hasnever beenmine toownaught sovaluable even asastool orbedstead
that wasn't rickety. Ithought that with your help Ishould getout
ofthis trouble, and that'swhy Isaidwhat Idid.Benotangry with
me,mylord." Said theChaplain [386] inhisturn totheTi-easurer, "How
thencameyoutopassontomewhat thisfellow hadnever given toyou?"
"Ionly saidsobecause Ithought that ifyou aiid I,bothhigh officers of
state, stand together, wecansoon putthematter right." "Brahmin,"
now saidtheChief Musician totheChaplain, "when, pray, didyougive
thejewel tome?" "Ionly said Idid,"answered theChaplain, "because
Ithought youwould help tomake thetime passmore agreeably." Lastly
thecourtesan said,"Oh, youwretch ofamusician, youknow younever
visited me,norIyou. Sowhen could youhave givenmethenecklace, as
yousay?" "Why beangry,mydear?" saidtheMusician, "we fivehave
gottokeephouse together forabit; soletusputacheerful faceonitand
behappy together."
This conversation being reported totheBodhisatta byhisagents, hefelt
convinced the fivewere allinnocent oftherobbery, andthat afemale
monkey hadtaken thenecklace. "And Imust findameans tomake her
drop it,"saidhetohimself. Sohehadanumber ofbead necklaces made.
Next hehadanumber ofmonkeys caught andturned loose again, with
strings ofbeads ontheir necks, wrists and ancles. Meantime, theguilty

monkey kept sitting inthe ti"ees watching hertreasure. Then theBodhi-
satta ordered anumber ofmen tocarefully observe everymonkey inthe
grounds, tilltheysawonewearing themissing pearl necklace, andthen
frighten herintodropping it.
Tricked outintheirnew splendour, theothermonkeys strutted about
tilltheycame tothereal thief, before whom they flaunted their tinery.
Jealousy overcoming herprudence, sheexclaimed, "They're onlybeads!"
andputonherown necklace ofreal pearls. Thiswas atonce seenby
thewatchers, whopromptly made herdrop thenecklace, which they
picked upandbrought totheBodhisatta. Hetook ittotheKing, saying,
"Here, sire, istlienecklace. The fiveprisoners areinnocent; itwasa
female monkey inthepleasaunce tliattook it.""How cameyou tofind
thatoutl" asked theKing; "andhow didyoumanage togetpossession
ofitagain 1"Then theBodhisatta toldthewhole story, andtheKing
thanked [387] theBodhisatta, saying, "You aretherightman intheright
place." Andheuttered thisstanza inpraise oftheBodhisatta:—
Forwarmen crave thehero's might.
Forcounsel sage sobriety.
Boon comrades fortheir jollity,
Butjudgment when inparlous plight.
Over andabove these words ofpraise andgratitude, theKiiag showered
treasures upon theBodhisatta likeastorm-cloud pouring rainfrom the
heavens. After following theBodhisatta's counsels through along life
S[)ent incharity andgood works, theKing passed away tofarethereafter
accordincj tohisdeserts.

''Trust not thetrusted." This story was toldbytheMaster while at
Jetavana, about taking things ontrust.
Tradition tellsusthat inthose days theBrethren, forthemost part, used to

sisters, oruncles oraunts, orother kinsfolk. Arguing tliat intheir laystate they

likewise shewed nocircumspection orcaution before iising food, clothing andother
requisites which their relations gavethem. Observing thistheMaster feltthathe
must readtheBrethren alesson. Sohecalled them together, andsaid,"Brethren,
nomatter whether [388] thegiver bearelation ornot, letcircumspection accom-
pany use.TheBrother whowithout circumspection usestheI'equisites which are
given tohim,may entail onhimself asubsequent existence asanogre orasa

just thesame, whether itl»egiven byarelative orbyastranger. There were
thosewho inbygone days actually didtakepoison because itwasoffered bythose
nearanddear tothem, andthereby theymettheir end." Sosaying, hetoldthe
following story ofthepast.
Once upon atimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasaverywealthy merchant. Hehadaherdsman who,when
thecornwasgrowing thick, drove hiscows totheforest andkeptthem
there atashieling, bringing theproduce fi'om time totime tothemerchant.
Nowhardbytheshieling intheforest there dwelt alion ;andsoafraid of
thelionwere thecows thattheygavebut little milk. Sowhen theherdsman
brought inhisgheeoneday,themerchant askedwhy therewassolittle of
it.Then theherdsman toldhimthereason. "Well, hasthelionformed

"Could youcatch thatdoe]" "Yes, master." "Well, catch her,andrub
her alloverwith poison andsugar, and letherdry. Keep heradayor

lickher alloverwith histongue, and die.Take hishide witli theclaws
andteeth and fat,andbring them back tome." Sosaying, hegave deadly
poison totheherdsman andsenthim off".With theaidofanetwhich he
made, theherdsman caught thedoeandcarried outtheBodhisatta's orders.
Assoon ashesawthedoeagain, the lion, inhisgreat love forher,
licked herwith histongue sothathedied. And theherdsman took the
lion's hideandthe rest,andbrought them totheBodhisatta, who said,
"Affection forothers should beeschewed. Mai-k how, forallhisstrength,
theking ofbeasts, thelion,was ledbyhissinful love foradoetopoison
himself bylicking herandsotodie." Sosaying, heuttered thisstanza for
theinstruction ofthose gathered around:—
[389] Trust notthetrusted, nor th'untrusted trust;
Trust kills; through trust thelion bitthedust.
Suchwasthelesson which theBodhisatta taught tothose around him.
After alifespent incharity andother good works, hepassed away to
fareaccording tohisdeserts.
His lesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Iwasthe
merchant ofthose days."

LOMAHAMSA-JATAKA.
"Now st'ort7iea?."— This «tory theMaster told while atPatikarama near
Vesali, about yuiiakkhatta.
Foratthattime Sunakkliatta, having become anadherent oftheMaster,
wastravelling about thecountry asaBrother withbowlandrobes, when hewas
perverted tothetenets ofKora theKshatriya^. Sohereturned totheBlessed
Buddha hisbowlandrobes and revei'ted toalay lifebyreason ofKora the
Kshatriya, about thetimewhen this latter hadbeen re-born astheoffspring
oftheKiilakaajaka Asura. And hewent jibout within thethree walls of
Vesali defoming theMaster byattirming that there wasnothing superhuman
about thesageGotama, whowasnotdistinguished from othermenbypreaching
asaving faith ;that thesageGotama haeisimply worked outasystem which
wastheoutcome ofhisownindividual thought andstudy ;andthattheideal for
theattainment ofwhich hisdoctrine waspreached, didnotlead tothedestruc-
tionofsorrow inthosewhofollowed it'-^.
Now thereverend Sariputta wasonhisround foralmswhen heheard
Sunakkhatta's blasphemies ;andonhisreturn from hisround hereported this
totheBlessed One. Said theMaster, "Sunakkhatta isahot-headed person,
Sariputta, andspeaks idlewords. Hishot-headeduess hasledhim totalk like
thisandtodeny thesaving grace ofmydoctrine. Unwittingly, thisfoolish person
isextolling me; Isayunwittingly, forhehasnoknowledge [390] ofmyefficacy.
Inme,Sariputta, dwell theSixKnowledges, andhereinam1more thanhuman;
theTenPowers arewithin me,andtheFourGrounds ofConfidence. 1know
thelimits ofthefourtypes ofearthly existence andthe fivestates ofpossible
re-birth after earthly death. This too isasuperhuman quality inme;and
whoso denies itmust retract hiswords, change his belief, andrenounce his
heresy, orhewillwithout adobecast into hell." Having thus magnified the
sui)ei-human nature and])ower which existed within him, theMaster wentonto
say,"Sunakkhatta, 1hear, Sariputta, to(jk delight inthemisguided self-mortifi-
cations oftheasceticism ofKora theKshatriya ;andtherefore itwasthathe
could takenopleasure inme. Ninety-one ;eons ago Ilived thehigher lifeinall
itsfour forms-', examining intothat false asceticism todiscover whether the
truth abode therein. Anascetic was I,thechief ofascetics ;worn and
emaciated was I,beyond allothers ;loathing ofcomfort had I,aloathing
surpassing that ofallothers ;Idwelt apart, andunapproachable wasmypassion
forsolitude." Then, attheElder's request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime, ninety-one jbous ago, theBodhisatta sethimself to
examine intothefalse asceticism. Sohebecame arecluse, according to
theNaked Ascetics (Ajivikas),—unclothed andcovered with dust, solitary
and lonely, fleeing likeadeerfrom theface ofmen ;hisfoodwassmall

disturbed, hetookuphisabode inadread thicket inthejungle. Inthe
snows ofwinter, hecame forthbynight from thesheltering thicket tothe
open air,returning with thesun-rise tohisthicket again;and, ashewas
wetwith thedriving snows bynight, sointhedaytimehewasdrenched
bythedrizzle from thebranches ofthethicket. Thus dayandnight
alike heendured theextremity ofcold. Insummer, heabode bydayinthe
open air,andbynight intheforest—scorched bytheblazing sunbyday,
andfanned bynocooling breezes bynight, sothatthesweat streamed from
him.And there pi'esented itself tohismind thisstanza, which wasnew
andnever uttered before:—
Now scorched, now frore, lone inthelonesome woods.
Beside nofire,but allafire within.
Naked, thehermit wrestles fortheTruth.
[391] Bxitwhen after alifespent intherigours ofthisasceticism, the
vision ofhell rose before theBodhisatta ashelaydying, herealised
theworthlessness ofallhisausterities, andinthatsupreme moment broke
away from hisdelusions, laidhold oftherealtruth, andwasre-born inthe
Heaven ofDevas.
His lesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Iwasthe

"Nay, Ananda," saidtheMaster; "call notthisasorry little town, alittle

Sudassana's universal monarchy, itwas inthistown that Ihadmydwelling. It
wasthen amighty cityencompassed byjewelled walls [392] twelve leagues
round." Therewithal, attheElder's request, hetold thisstory ofthepastand
uttered theMaha-Sudassana Sutta'^.
Then itwas that Sudassana's queen Subhadda marked how, after
coming down from thePalace ofTruth, herlordwaslying hardbyon
hisright sideonthecouch prepared forhim inthePalm-grove^ which
was allofgoldandjewels,—thatcouch fromwhich hewasnot torise
again. And she said, "Eighty-four thousand cities, chief ofwhich is
theroyal-city ofKusavati, own youi- sovereignty, sire. Setyour heart
onthem."
"Say not so,myqueen," saidSudassana ;"rather exhort me,saying,
'Keep your heart setonthistown, andyearn notafter those others'."
"Why so,mylord?"
"Because Ishall dieto-day," answered theking.
Intears, wiping herstreavning eyes, thequeen managed tosol)out
thewords thekingbade hersay. Then shebroke intoweeping and
lamentation; andtheotherwomen oftheharem, tothenumber ofeighty-
four thousand, alsowept andwailed ;norcould any ofthecourtiers
forbear, but allalike joined inoneuniversal lament.
"Peace!" saidtheBodhisatta ;andathisword their lamentation was
stilled. Then, turning tothequeen, hesaid,—"Weep not,myqueen, nor
wail. For,evendown toatiny seed ofsesamum, there isnosuch thing
asacompound thing which is,permanent ;allaretransient, allmust

lesson tobelearnt isthatsuch mindfulness should bej^i'actised andperfected.

cerning theBelle oftheLand, with both textandinterpretation. [.39.5] Then,

ofpractising right mindfulness concerning thebody, should beascareful notto

When theyhadheard theSutta and itsmeaning, theBrethren said:—"It

Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta w^astheyoungest oftheKing's hundred sons,andgrewuptomanhood.
Now inthose days there werePacceka Buddhas wlioused tocome totake
their meals atthepalace, andtheBodhisatta ministered tothem.
Thinking oneday ofthegreat number ofbrothers hehad, the
Bodhisatta asked himself whether there wasanylikelihood ofhiscoming
tothethrone ofhisfathers inthat city,anddetermined toaskthe
Pacceka Buddhas totellhimwhat should come topass. Next daythe
Buddhas came, took thewater-pot thatwasconsecrated toholy uses,
filtered thewater, washed anddried their feet,and satedown totheir
meal. And asthey sat, tlieBodhisatta cameandseating himself bythem
with acourteous salutation, put hisquestion. And theyanswered and
said, "Prince, you willnever come tobeking inthis city. But in
Gandhara, twothousand leagues away, there stands thecityofTakkasila.
Ifyoucanreach that city, inseven daysyou willbecome king there.
Butthere isperilontheroad thither, injourneying through agreat forest.

sense ofbeauty with utter loveliness, theearwith sweet minstrelsy, the
nostrils withheavenly odours, thetaste withheavenly dainties ofexquisite
savour, andthetouch with red-cushioned couches divinely soft. But if
youcansubdue your senses, andbestrong inyour resolve nottolook
upon them, thenontheseventh dayyou willbecome king ofthecityof
Takkasila."
"Oh, sirs ;how could Ilookupon theogresses after your advice to
me?" Sosaying, theBodhisatta besought thePacceka Buddhas togivehim
something tokeep him safeonhisjourney. Receiving from thtnn a
charmed thread andsome charmed sand, hefirst bade farewell tothe
Pacceka Buddhas and tohisfather andmother ;andthen, going tohis
own abode, headdressed hishousehold asfollows:—"Iamgoing to
Takkasila tomake myself king there. You willstopbehind here." But
fiveofthem answered, "Letusgotoo."
"You may notcome with me,"answered theBodhisatta; "for Iam
toldthat theway isbeset byogresses who captivate men's senses, and
destroy thosewhosuccumb totheir charms. Great isthedanger, butI
willrelyonmyself andgo."
"Ifwegowith you, prince, weshould notgazeupon their baleful
charms. WetoowillgotoTakkasila." "Then shew yourselves steadfast,"
saidtheBodhisatta, andtook those fivewithhimonhisjourney.
Theogresses satwaiting bytheway intheir villages. Andoneofthe
five,thelover ofbeauty, looked upon theogresses, andbeing ensnared by
their beauty, lagged behind therest. "Why areyoudropping behind ]"
asked theBodhisatta. "Myfeethurtme,prince. I'lljust sitdown fora

these areogresses ;don'thanker after them." "Bethat asitmay, prince,
Ican't goany further." "Well, you willsoon beshewn inyour real
colours," saidtheBodhisatta, ashewent onwith theother four.
Yielding tohissenses, thelover ofbeauty drew near totheogresses,

Only theBodhisatta was leftnow.And oneoftheogresses followed
him,promising herself that forallhisstern resolution shewould succeed in
devouring him eresheturned back. Further onintheforest, woodmen
andothers, seeing theogress, asked herwhothemanwas thatwalked on
ahead.
"He ismyhusband, good gentlemen."
"Hi, there !"saidthey totheBodhisatta; "when you liave gotasweet
young wife, fairastheflowers, toleave herhome andputhertrust inyou,
why don'tyouwalk with herinstead ofletting hertrudge wearily behind
you1""She isnowife ofmine, butanogress. Shehaseatenmyfive
companions." "Alas! good gentlemen," said she,"anger willdrivemen
tosaytheir verywives areogresses andghouls."
Next, shesimulated pregnancy andthen thelook ofawoman whohas
borne onechild; and child on hi[), shefollowed after theBodhisatta.
Everyone theymetasked justthesame questions about thepair,andthe
Bodhisatta gave just tliesameanswer ashejourneyed on.
Atlasthecame toTakkasila, where theogress made thechild dis-
appear, andfollowed alone. Atthegates ofthe city tlieBodhisatta
entered aRest-house and satdown. Because oftheBodhisatta's efficacy
andpower, shecould notenter too; soshearrayed liei-self indivine beauty
andstood onthethreshold.
TheKing ofTakkasila was atthatmoment passing byonhisway to
hispleasaunce, andwassnared byherloveliness. "Go, findout," saidhe
toanattendant, "whether shehasahusband [.398] with herornot."And
when themessenger cameandasked whether shehadahusband with her,
shesaid, "Yes, sir ;myhusband issitting witliin inthechamber."
"She isnowife ofmine," saidtheBodhisatta. "She isanogress and
haseatenmyfivecompanions."
And, asbefore, shesaid,"Alas !good gentlemen, anger willdrivemen
tosayanything thatcomes into their heads."
Then themanwentback totheKing andtoldhimwhat eachhadsaid.
"Treasure-trove isaroyal perquisite," saidtheKing. Andhesent forthe
ogress andhadherseated ontheback ofhiselephant. After asolemn
procession round the city, theKing came back tohispalace andhadthe
ogress lodged intheapartments reserved foraqueen-consort. After
bathing andperfuming himself, theKing atehisevening mealandthen
laydown onhisroyal bed. The ogress toojn-epai'ed herself ameal, and
donned allhersplendour. And asshelaybytheside ofthedelighted
King, sheturned ontohersideandburst into tears. Being askedwhy
shewept, she said, "Sire, youfound niebythewayside, andthewomen
oftheharem aremany. Dwelling hereamong enemies Ishall feelcrushed
when they say'Whoknows whoyour father andmother are,oranything
about your family? Youwere picked upbythewayside.' But ifyour

majesty would givemepower andauthority over thewhole kingdom,
nobody would dare toannoymewithsuch taunts."
"Sweetheart, Ihavenopower over those that dwell throughout my
kingdom ;Iamnottheir lordandmaster. Ihave only jurisdiction over
those who revolt ordoiniquity'. SoIcannot giveyoupower and
authority overthewhole kingdom."
"Then, sire, ifyoucannot givemeauthority over thekingdom orover
thecity, atleast givemeauthority within thepalace, that Imayhave rule
hereover those thatdwell inthepalace."
Toodeeply smitten withhercharms torefuse, theKing gaveherauthority
over allwithin thepalace andbade herhave ruleoverthem [399]. Con-
tented, shewaited tilltheKing was asleep, andthenmaking herway to
thecityofthe ogi-es returned with thewhole crew ofogres tothe[)alace.
Andsheherself slew theKing anddevoured him, skin, tendons andHesh,
leaving only thebare bones. And therestoftheogres entering thegate
devoured everything asitcame intheir way, notleaving even afowl ora
dog alive. Next daywhen peo[)le came andfound thegate shut, tliey
beatonitwithimpatient cries, andeffected anentrance,—only tofindthe
whole palace strewn with bones. And they exclaimed, "Sothemanwas
right insaying shewasnothiswifebutanogress. Inhisunwisdom the
King brought herhome tobehiswife,anddoubtless shehasassembled the
other ogres, devoured everybody, andthenmade off."
Now onthatdaytheBodhisatta, with thecharmed sandonhishead
andthecharmed thread twisted round hisbrow, wasstanding intheRest-
house, sword inhand, waiting forthedawn. Those others, meantime,
cleansed thepalace, garnished the floors afresh, sprinkled perfumes on
them, scattered flowers, hanging nosegays from theroofandfestooning the
walls with garlands, andburning incense intheplace. Then they took
counsel together, asfollows:—
"Theman thatcould somaster hissenses asnotsomuch astolook at
theogress asshefollowed him inherdivine beauty, isanoble andstead-
fastman, filled with wii^dom. With suchanoneasking, itAvould bewell
with thewhole kingdom. Letusmake himourking."
And allthecourtiers and allthecitizens ofthekingdom were one-
minded inthematter. SotheBodhisatta, being chosen king,wasescorted
intothecapital andthere decked injewels andanointed king ofTakkasila.
Shunning thefour evilpaths, andfollowing thetenpaths ofkingly duty,
heruled hiskingdom inrighteousness, andafter alifespent incharity and
other goodworks jjassed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

'•Seeing Quick c?ea(i."— This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aBrother whothought luckwent bynames. Forwehear tliatayoung
man ofgood family, named 'Base,' hadgiven hisheart totheFaith, andjoined
theBrotherhood. [402]And theBrethren used tocalltohim,"Here, Brother
Base!"and"Stay, Brother Base," tillheresolved that, as'Base' gave theideaof
incarnate wickedness and ill-luck, hewould change hisname tooneofbetter
omen. Accordingly heasked histeachers and pi-eceptors togivehim anew
name. Butthey saidthat aname only served todenote, anddidnotimpute
qualities ;andtheybadehim restcontent with thename hebad. Time after
time herenewed hisrequest, tillthewhole Brotherhood knew what importance
heattached toamerename. And asthey satdiscussing thematter intheHall
ofTruth, theMaster entered andasked what itwastheywerespeaking about.
Being told, hesaid"This isnotthe firsttime thisBrother hasbelieved luck
wentbynames ;hewasequally dissatisfied with thename hebore inaformer
age." Sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatime theBodhisatta wasateacher ofworld-wide fame at
Takkasila, and fivehundred young brahmins learnt theVedas from his
lips. One oftliese young menwasnamed Base. Andfrom continually
hearing hisfellows say,"Go,Base"and"Come, Base," helonged togetrid
ofhisname and totakeonethathadalessill-omened ringabout it.So
hewent tohismaster andasked thatanewname ofarespectable charac-
termight begiven him. Said hismaster, "Go,myson,and travel
through theland tillyouhavefound anameyoufancy. Tlien come back
and Iwillchange yourname foryou."
Theyoung man didasliewasbidden, andtaking provisions forthe

journey wandered from village tovillage tillhecanie toacertain town.
Here amannamed Quick had died, andtheyoung brahmin seeing him
borne tothecemetery asked what hisname was.
"Quick," wasthereply. "What, canQuick Ijedead?" "Yes, Quick
isdead; bothQuick andDead diejustthesame.Aname only .serves to
mark who's who. Youseem afool."
Hearing thishewentonintothecity, feeling neither satisfied nordis-
satisfied with hisownname.
Now a.slave-girl hadbeen thi'own down atthedoor ofahouse, while
hermaster and mistress beat herwith rope-ends because shehadnot
brought home herwages. And thegirl'sname wasRich. [403] Seeing
thegirlbeing beaten, ashewalked along thestreet, heasked thereason,
andwastold inreply that itwasbecause shehadnowages toshew.
"Andwhat isthegirl'sname ?"
"Rich," said they. "And cannot Richmake good apaltry day's
pay?""Beshecalled Rich orPoor, themoney's notforthcoming any
themore.Aname only serv^es tomark who's who. Y^ouseem afool."
More reconciled tohisownname, theyoung brahmin leftthecityand
ontheroadfound anu^nwhohad lost hisway. Having learnt thathe
had losthisway, theyoung manasked what hisname was. "Guide,"
wasthereply. "And hasGuide lost hisway*?" "Guide orMisguide,
youcanloseyourway justthesame.Aname only serves tomark who's
who. Youseem afool."
Quite reconciled now tohisname, theyoung brahmin came back tohis
master.
"Well, whatname haveyouchosen'?" asked theBodhisatta. "Mastei-,"
said he,"Ifindthatdeath comes to'Quick' and'Dead' alike, that'Rich'
and'Poor 'maybepoor together, andthat'Guide'and'Misguide'alike
miss their way. Iknownowthataname serves only totellwho iswho,
anddoesnotgovern itsowner's destiny. SoIamsatisfied withmyown
name, anddonotwant tochange itforanyother."
Then theBodhisatta uttered this stanza, combining what theyoung
brahmin haddone witli thesights hehadseen:—
Seeing Quick dead, Guide lost.Rich poor.
Base learned content nortravelled more.
Hisstory told, theMaster said "Soyou see,Brethren, that informer days as
now thisBrother imagined there wasagreat deal inaname." Andheidentified
theBirth bysaying, "This Brother who isdiscontented with hisname wasthe
discontented young brahmin ofthose days; theBuddha's disciples were the

wliile atJetavana, a1)out acheating merchant. There weretwomerchants in

with this object hemadesome excuse daybydayforputting oft"thedivision of
theprofits.
Finding thAt itwasinvain topress foradivision, thehonest partner went to
theMaster atthemonastery, made hissalutation, andwasreceived kindly. "It
isaverylong time," saidtheBuddha, "since youcame lasttoseeme."And
hereupon themerchant toldtheMaster whathadbefallen him.
"This isnotthe first time, lay-follower," saidtheMaster, "that thisman
hasbeen acheating merchant; hewasnolessacheat intimes past. Ashe
tries todefraud younow, sodidhetrytodefraud thewiseandgood ofother
days." Sosaying, atthemerchant's request, theMaster told thisstory ofthe
past.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn into amerchant'.s family andonname-day wasnamed
'Wise.' When hegrew upheentered into partnership with another
merchant named 'Wisest,' andtraded with him.And these twotook five
hundred waggons ofmerchandise from Benares tothecountry-districts,
where they dispo.sed oftheir wares, returning afterwards with theproceeds
tothecity.When thetime fordividing came, Wisest said,"Imusthave
adouble share." "Why so?"asked Wise. "Because while youareonly
Wise, IamWisest. AndWise ought tohave onlyoneshare toWisest's
two." "Butwebothhadanequal interest inthestock-in-trade and in
theoxenandwaggons. Why should youhavetwoshares'?" "Because I
amWisest." And sothey talked away tillthey felltoquarrelling.
"Ah!" thought Wisest, "Ihave aplan." Andhemade hisfather hide
in[405] ahollo.w tree, enjoining theoldman tosay,when thetwocame,
"Wisest should have adouble portion." This arranged, hewent tothe
Bodhisatta andproposed tohim torefer theclaim foradouble shai-e to
thecompetent decision oftheTree-Sprite. Then hemade hisappeal in
these words: "Lord Tree-Sprite, decide ourcause!" Hex'eupon thefather,
whowashidden inthetree, inachanged voice asked them tostate the

case. Thecheat addressed thetree asfollows: "Lord, here stands Wise,
andherestand IWisest. Wehavebeen partners intrade. Declare what
share eachshould receive."
"Wise should receive oneshare, andWisest two," wastheresponse.
Hearing this decision, theBodhisatta resolved tofindoutwhether it
wasindeed aTree-Sprite ornot. Sohefilled thehollow trunk withstraw
and set itonfire.And Wisest's father was half roasted bytherising
flames andclambered upbyclutching hold ofabough. Falling tothe
ground, heuttered thisstanza:—
Wise rightly, Wisest wrongly gothisname;
Through Wisest, I'mnigh roasted intheflame.
Then thetwomerchants made anequal division andeachtook half,
andattheir deaths passed away tofareaccording totheir deserts.
"Thus you see," saidtheMaster, "that your partner wasasgreat acheat in
pasttimes asnow." Having ended hisstory, heidentified theBirtli bysaying,
"The cheating merchant ofto-day wasthecheating merchant inthestory, and
Ithehonest merchant named Wise."

Himalayas, where fivehundred hermits gathei'ed round him. Onerainy
season, hischief disciple went with halfthehermits tothehaunts ofmen
toget saltand vinegar. And thatwasthetimewhen theBodhisatta
should die.And hisdisciples, wishing toknow hisspiritual attainment,
said tohim, "What excellence haveyouwonl"
"Won?" saidhe;"1havewon Notliiyiy^." Sosaying, hedied, butwas
reborn intheBrahma Realm ofRadiant Devas. (For Bodhisattas even
though theymayhave attained tothehighest state arenever reborn in
theFormless World, because theyareincapable ofpassing beyond theRealm
ofForm.) Mistaking hismeaning, hisdisciples concluded thathehad
failed towinanyspiritual attainment. Sothey didnotpaythecustomary
honours atcremation.
Onhisreturn thechief disciple learnt that themaster wasdead, and
asked whether theyhadasked what hehadwon. "He saidhehadwon
nothing," said they. "Sowedidnotpayhim theusual honours at
cremation."
"You understood not hismeaning," said that chief disciple. "Our
master meant thathehadattained totheinsight called theinsight into
theNothingness ofThings." Butthough heexplained thisagain and
again tothedisciples, they believed him not.
Knowing their unbelief, theBodhisatta cried, "Fools !they donot
believe mychief disciple. Iwillmake thisthing plain unto them." And
hecame from theBrahma Realm andbyvirtue ofhismighty powers
rested inmid-air above thehermitage anduttered thisstanza inpraise of
thewisdom ofthechief disciple:—[407]

Thus didtheGreat Being from mid-air proclaim theTruth andrebuke
theband ofhermits. Then hepassed back totheBrahma Realm, and
allthose hermits tooqualified themselves forrebirth inthesame Realm.

"/;i guise ofjoy."—This story was toldbytheMaster while atKunda-
dhanavana near thecity ofKundiya about Suppavasix, alay-sister, whowas
daughter toKing Koliya. For atthat time, she,whohad carried achild
seven years inherwomb, was intheseventh day ofherthroes, andher
pains were grievous. Inspite ofallheragony, shethought asfollows:—"All-
Enlightened istheBlessed Onewhopreaches theTruth totheendthatsuch
suffering may cease; righteous aretheElect oftheBlessed Onewho sowalk
thatsuch suffering may cease; blessed isNirvana wherein such suffering doth
cease." These three thoughts were herconsolation inherpangs. And she
sentherhusband totheBuddha totellherstateandbearagreeting forher.
Hermessage wasgiven totheBlessed One,who said, [408]"May Suppavasa,
daughter oftheking oftheKoliyas, grow strong and well again, andbear a
healthy child." And attheword oftheBlessed One, Suppavasa, daughter of
theking oftheKoliyas, became welland strong, andbore ahealtliy child.
Finding onhisreturn tliat hiswifehadbeen safely delivered, thehusband
marvelled greatly attheexalted powers oftheBuddha. Now that herchild
wasborn, Suppavasa waseager toshew bounty forseven days totheBrother-
hood with theBuddha atitshead, andsent herhusband back toinvite them.
Now itchanced that atthattime theBrotherhood with theBuddha atitshead
hadreceived aninvitation from thelayman whosupported theElder Moggallana
theGreat; buttheMaster, wishing togratify Suppavasa's charitable desires,
sent totheElder toexplain thematter, andwith theBrotherhood accepted
forseven days thehospitality ofSuppavasa. Ontheseventh dayshedressed
upher little boy,whose name was Sivali, andmadehimbowbefore theBuddha
andtheBrotherhood. Andwhen hewasbrought induecourse toSariputta,
theElder inallkindness greeted theinfant, saying, "Well, Sivali, isallwell
withyou?" "How could itbe,sir?" saidtheinfant. "Seven long years have
Ihadtowallow inblood."
Then injoySuppavasa exclaimed, "My child, onlyseven days old, isactually
discoursing onreligion with theapostle Sariputta, theCaptain oftheFaith!"
"Would you likeanother such achild?" asked theMaster. "Yes, sir;"
saidSuppavasa, "seven more, ifIcould havethem likehim." Insolemn phrase
theMaster gavethanks forSuppavasfi's hospitality anddeparted.
Atseven years ofagethechild Sivali gave hisheart totheFaith and
forsook theworld tojoin theBrotherhood ;attwenty hewasadmitted afull
Brother. Righteous washeandwon thecrown ofrighteousness which is
Arahatship, andtheearth shouted aloud forjoy.
Soonedaytheassembled Brethren talked with oneanother intheHall
ofTruth respecting thematter, saying, "TheElder Sivali, who isnowsoshining
alight, wasthechild ofmany prayers ;seven long years washeinthewomb
andseven days inbirth. How greatmust have been thepains ofmother and
child !Ofwhat deeds were their pains thefruit?"
Entering thehall,theMaster asked thesubject oftheir discourse. "Brethren,"
said he,"the righteous Sivali [409]wasseven years inthewomb andseven days
inbirth allbecause ofhisownpast deeds. And similarly Suppavasa's seven
years' pregnancy andseven days' travail resulted from herownpast deeds."

Now inthose days theKing ofKosala cameupwith agreat force against

When thekingwas slain, hissonmade hisescape through thesewer.
Afterwards hecollected amighty forceandcame toBenares. Encamping
hard by,hesentamessage totheking toeither surrender thekingdom

battle. But themother oftheyoung prince, hearing ofthis, sent a
message toherson, saying, "There isnoneed todobattle. Letevery
a})proach tothecityonevery sidebeinvested andbarred, tilllack of
firewood andwater andfood wears outthepeople. Then thecity will
fallintoyourhands without anyfighting." Following hismother's advice,
theprince forseven days invested thecitywith soclose ablockade that
thecitizens ontheseventh daycutofftheir king's headandbrought itto
theprince. Then heentered thecityandmade himself king, andwhen
hislifeended hepas<sed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.
The result andconsequence ofhisacts inblockading thecity forthose seven
dayswasthat forseven years heabode inthewomb andwasseven days in
birth. But,inasmuch ashehad fallen atthefeetoftheBuddha Padumuttara
andhad [)rayed withmany gifts that thecrown ofArahatship might behis;
and,inasmuch as,inthedays oftheBuddha Vipassi, hehad ofFei'ed upthe

hismerit, hewontheci'own ofArahatship. Andbecause Suppaviisa sent the
message bidding hersontake thecitybyblockade, shewasdoomed toaseven
years' pregnancy andtoaseven days' travail.
Hisstory ended, theMaster, asBuddha, repeated these verses:—
Inguise ofjoyand blessings, sorrow comes
And trouble, sluggai'ds' hearts tooverwhelm.

bothbynight andbyday. Thesough ofthewind, therustle ofafan,orthe
cryofbird orbea.st would inspire himwith such abject terror thathewould
shriek anddash away. Henever reflected thatdeath wassure toconie upon
him;though, hadhepractised meditation onthecertainty ofdeath, hewould
nothave feared it.[415] Foronly they thatdonotsomeditate fear death.
Now hisconstant fear ofdying became known totheBrethren, andoneday
theymet intheHall ofTruth and felltodiscussing hisfearfulness andthe
propriety ofevery Brother's taking death asatheme formeditation. Entering
theHall, theMaster asked, andwas told,what theywere discussing. Sohesent
forthatBrother andasked himwhether itwastruehelived infearofdeath.
TheBrother confessed thathedid."Benotangry. Brethren," saidtheMaster,
"with thisBrother. The fear ofdeath that tills hisbreast nowwasnoless
strong inbygone times." Sosaying hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Onceonatiuiewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodlii-
sattawasaTree- Sprite near theHimalayas. And inthose days theking
put hisstate elephant intheelepliant-trainers' hands tobebroken into
stand firm.And they tiedtheelephant upfast toapost,andwithgoads
intheir hands setal)Out training theanimal. Unable tobear thepain
whilst hewasbeing made todotheir bidding, tlieelephant broke thepost
down, putthetrainers toflight, andmade offtotheHimalayas. And
themen, being unable tocatch it,had tocome back empty-handed. The
elephant lived intheHimalayas inconstant fear ofdeath.Abreath of
wind sufficed to fillhimwith fearand tostarthim offatfull speed,
shaking histrunk toand fro.And itwaswithhim asthough hewas
stilltiedtothepost tobetrained. Allhappiness ofmind andbody gone,
hewandered upanddown inconstant dread. Seeing this,theTi-ee-Sprite
stood inthefork ofhisti'eeanduttered thisstanza:—
Fear'st thou thewind that ceaselessly
The i-otteu boughs doth rend alway I
Such fear willwaste thee quite away!
[416] Such were theTree-Sprite's cheering words. And theelephant
thenceforth feared nomore.
Hislesson ended, theMaster taught theFour Trutlis (attheclose whereof
tlieBrother entered the Paths), and identified theBirth bysaying, "This
Br(;ther wastheelephant ofthose daysand ItheTree-Sprite."

tothehermitage, and,opening thedoor, said tohisson,"Every other day

about aBrother whothrew and hitaswan.Wearetoldthat thisBrother, wlio
came ofagood family inSavatthi, hadacquired great skill inhitting things with
stones;andthathearing tlieTruth preached onedayhegave hisheart toitand,
giving uptheworld, wasadmitted tofullBrotherhood. Butneither instudy nor
practice didheexcel asaBrother. Oneday,with ayouthful Brother, hewent
totheriver Aciravatii, andwasstanding onthebank after bathing, when hesaw
twowhite swans flying by. Saidhetotheyounger Brother, "I'll hitthehinder
swan intheeyeandbring itdown." "Bring itdown indeed!" saidtheother;
"you can't hitit.""Just youwait amoment. I'llhit itontheeyethis side
through theeyeontheother." "Oh, nonsense." "Very well; youwaitand
see." Then hetook athree-cornered stone inhishand andflung itafter the
swan. 'Whiz' went thestone through theairandtheswan, suspecting danger,
stopped tolisten. AtoncetheBrother seized asmooth round stone andasthe

stone went inatoneeyeandcame outattheother. Andwithaloudscream
theswan felltotheground attheir feet. "That isahighly improper action,"
saidtheother Brother, andbrought him before theMaster, withanaccount of
what hadhappened. After rebuking theBrother, theMaster said,"Thesame

thechaplain short, andlooked highandlowforsuchanone.Now at
thattime there wasacripple inBenares whowasawonderful marksman
with stones, andtheboys used toputhimonalittle cartand[419]
draw him tothegates ofBenares, where there isalarge branching
banyan-tree covered with leaves. There theywould gather round and
givehim half-pence, saying'Make anelephant,' or'Make ahorse.'
And the ci'ipple would throw stone after stone tillhehad cutthe
foliage into theshapes asked for.And thegi-ound wascovered with
fallen leaves.
Onhisway tohispleasaunce theKing came tothespot, and allthe
boysscampered offinfearoftheKing, leaving thecripple there helpless.
Atthesight ofthe litter ofleaves theKing asked, asherodebyinhis
chariot, whohadcuttheleaves off.And hewas told that the ci'ipple
haddone it.Thinking that heremight beaway tostop thechaplain's
mouth, theKing asked where thecripple was,andwasshewn himsitting
atthefoot ofthe tree. Then theKing hadhimbrought tohimand,
motioning hisretinue tostand apart, said tothecripple, "Ihave avery
talkative chaplain. Doyouthink youcould stop histalking?"
"Yes, sire,—ifIhadapeashooter fullofdrygoat's dung," saidthe
cripple. Then theKing hadhimtaken tothepalace and setwith apea-
shooter fullofdrygoat's dung behind acurtain with aslitinit,facing the
chaplain's seat.When thebrahmin came towaitupon theKing andwas
seated ontheseatprepared forhim, hismajesty started aconversation.
And thechaplain forthwith monopolized theconversation, andnooneelse
could getaword in.Hereon thecripple shot thepellets ofgoat's dung
onebyone, like flies,through the slitinthecurtain right intothechap-
lain's gullet. And thebrahmin swallowed thepellets down astheycame,
likesomuch oil, tillallhaddisappeared. When thewhole peashooter-full
ofpellets waslodged inthechaplain's stomach, they swelled tothesize

brahmin inthese words: "Reverend sir,sotalkative areyou, thatyou

That's about asmuch asyou willbeable totake atasitting. Nowgo

From thatday[420] thechaplain kept hismouth shutand satas
silent during conversation asthough hislipswere sealed.

King, andbestowed onhim four villages, oneintheNorth, oneinthe

''•Learn thou betimes."—This story was toldbytheMaster, while hewas
dwelling intheGabled Chamber attheGreat Grove near Vesali, about aLicchavi,
ai)ious })riuce whohadembraced theTruth. Hehadinvited theBrotherhood
with theBuddha attheir head tohishouse, andthere hadshewn great bounty
towards them. Now hiswifewasavery fatwoman, almost bloated inap-
pearance, andshewasbadly dressed.
Thanking theKing forhishospitality, theMaster returned tothemonastery
and, after adiscourse totheBrethren, retired tohisperfumed chamber.
Assembled intheHall ofTruth, theBrethren expressed their surprise thata
man like tliisLicchavi prince should have such afatl)adly-dressed woman for
hiswife,and l;)esofond ofher. Entering theHallandhearing what theywere
discussing, theMaster said, "Brethren, asnow, soinformer times hewasfond
ofafatwoman." Then, attheir request, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
[421] Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares
theBodhisatta wasoneofhiscourtiers. And afatandbadly-dressed
country woman, whoworked forhire,waspassing near thecourtyard of
thepalace, when pressing need foranoccasion came upon hei\ Bendino-
down with herraiment decently gathered round her,sheaccomplished
herpurpose, andwaserect again inatrice.
TheKing chanced tobelooking outontothecourtyard through a
window atthetimeandsaw this. Thought he,"Awoman whocould
manage thiswith somuch decency must enjoy good health. Shewould
besure tobecleanly inherhouse ;andasonborn into acleanly house
would besure togrow upcleanly and virtuous. Iwillmake hermy
queen-consort." And accordingly theKing, firstassuring himself thatshe

wasnotanother's, sent forherandmade herhisqueen. And shebecame
verynearanddear tohim. Notlongafterwards asonwasborn, andthis
sonbecame anUniversal Monarch.
Observing herfortunes, theBodhisatta took occasion tosaytothe
King, "Sire, why should not care betaken duly tofulfil allproper
observances, when this excellent woman byhermodesty anddecency in
relieving nature wonyour majesty's favour and rose tosuch fortune?"
Andhewentontoutter thisstanza:—
Learn thou betimes, though headstrong folkthere be;The rustic pleased theKing bymodesty.
Thus didtheGreat Being commend thevirtues ofthosewhodevoted
themselves tothestudy ofproper observances.

"J^sfares histocrrshipper." —This story was toldbytheMaster when at
Savatthi, about averypoorman.
NowatSavatthi theIjrotherhood with theBuddha attheirheadused tobe
entertained nowbyasingle family, nowbythree orfour families together.
Orabody ofpeople orawhole street would club together, orsometimes the
whole cityentertained them. Butontheoccasion now inquestion itwasa
street thatwasshewing thehospitality. Andtheinhabitants hadarranged to
provide rice-gruel followed bycakes.
Now inthat sti'eet there lived averypoorman, ahired labourer, whocould
notseehowhecould give thegruel, butresolved togive cakes. And he
scraped outtheredpowder fromempty husks andkneaded itwithwater intoa
round cake. This cake hewrapped inaleafofswallow-wort, andbaked itin

should have it,andaccordingly took hisstand immediately bytheMaster. No
sooner hadtheword beengiven tooffer cakes, than hestepped forward quicker
tliananyone elseandputhiscake intheMaster's alms-bowl. And theMaster
declined allotlier cakes offered himandatethepoorman's cake. Forthwith the
whole citytalked ofnothing buthowtheAll-Enlightened Onehadnotdisdained
toeatthepoor man's bran-cake. Andfrom porters tonobles andKing, all

Thinking heliadbetter asktheMaster first,hewent tohimandstated his
case. "Take what they offer," saidtheMaster, "andimpute your righteousness
toallliving creatures." Sotheman settowork tocollect theofferings. Some
gave twice asmuch asothers, some fourtimes asmuch, others eight times as
much, andsoon, tillnine crores ofgoldwere contributed.
Returning thanks forthehospitality, theMaster went back tothemonastery
andafter instructing theBrethren andim[)arting hisblessed teaching tothem,
retired tohis[)erfumed chamber.
Intheevening theKing sent fen-thepoorman, and created himLord
Treasui'er.
Assembling intheHall ofTruth theBrethren spoke together ofhowthe
Master, notdisdaining thepoorman's bran-cake, hadeaten itasthough itwere
ambrosia, and liow thepoormanhadbeen enriched [423] andmade Loi'd
Treasurer tohisgreat good fortune. Andwhen theMaster entered theHall
andheard what theywere talking of,hesaid, "Brethren, this isnotthe first
time that Ihave notdisdained toeatthatpoorman's cake ofbran. Ididthe
samewhen IwasaTree-sprite, andthen toowasthemeans ofhisbeing made

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-

ofthose dayswere superstitious about gods. A.festival came round and
thevillagers ofiered sacrifices totheir respective Tree-sprites. Seeing
this,apoormanshewed worship tothecastor-oil tree. Alltheothers had
come with garlands, odours, perfumes, andcakes ;butthepoormanhad
only acake ofhusk-powder andwater inacocoanut shell forhistree.
Standing before it,hethought within himself, "Tree-sprites areused to
heavenly food,andmyTree-sprite willnoteatthiscake ofhusk-powder.
Why thenshould Ilose itoutright 1Iwilleat itmyself." Andheturned
togoaway, when theBodhisatta from thefork of liistree exclaimed,

Then themanturned again, and, seeing theBodhisatta, offered uphis

"Who callsme?" said thebrahmin, turning round. "I,brahmin."

alltheBrotherhood came toknow ofthelaziness ofthese indolent Brethren.
Assembling intheHall ofTruth theBrethren talked together ofthis thing.
And theMaster entered andwas toldwhat theywere discussing. Being asked
whether they were really soindolent, those Brethren admitted their short-
coming. "Brethren," said he,"informer times, nolessthan now, they were
indolent andloth toleave their abode." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.

gerous andperilous neighbourhood, where fishermen catch fishwith nets,
basket-traps, andsuch like tackle. Letusbeofftothewildcountry again."
Butsolazywere theother two fishes, andsogreedy, thattheykept putting

Now fishermen cast their nets intotheriver; andOver-thoughtful and
Thoughtless wereswimming onahead inquest offoodwhen intheir

TheMaster rebuked him inthesewords:— "Asnow, soinformer dayswert
thou mn-uly, Brotlier, disregarding thecounsels ofthewiseandgood. Where-
fore,byaj;u'elin thou didst die." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Braliraadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intoanacrobat's family. Wlien hegrew up,he
wasavery wiseandclever fellow. From another acrobat helearned the
javelin dance, andwith hismaster used totravel about exhibiting his
skill.Now thismaster ofhisknew thefourjavelin dance butnotthe
five;butonedaywhen performing inacertain village, he,being inliquor,
had fivejavelins setupinarowandgave outthat hewould dance
through the lot.
Said theBodhisatta, "You can't manage allfive javelins, master.
Have onetaken away. Ifyoutrythe five,you willberunthrough by
the fifthand die."
"Then youdon'tknow what Icandowhen Itry," saidthedrunken
fellow;andpaying noheed totheBodhisatta's words, hedanced through
four ofthejavelins only toimpale himself onthe fifth liketheBassia
flower onitsstalk. And there helaygroaning. Said theBodhisatta,
"This calamity comes ofyour disregarding thecounsels ofthewiseand
good"
;andheuttered thisstanza:—
[431]Toomuch— though soreagainst mywill—you tried;
Clearing thefour,upon the fifthyou died.
Sosaying, helifted hismaster from off"thejavelin point andduly

Recognising thenote ofapartridge, asportsman killed thebirdandtook

why they didnothear their neighbour thepartridge now. Then they
toldhimwhat hadhappened, andhelinked thetwoevents together in

Then the girl's mother insisted onhaving herdaughter restored toher,and

lamentations, saying, "What means this, sir 'IYou suffer unjustly."
Then thought theyoungman [434]"Allthissorrow hasbefallen mebecause
Iwasliving alay life. IfIcanonly escape thisdanger, Iwillgiveuptheworld

Now thegirlherself heard theuproar andasked what itmeant. Being told,

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn intothechaplain's family, andonhisfather's death
succeeded tothechaplaincy.
Now thekingpromised togrant whatsoever boon hisqueen should ask
ofliim,andshe said,—"Theboon Iask isaneasyone ;henceforth you

Accordingly, when hemarched outwith hishost, leaving theBodhisatta
inthecity, theking sentback amessenger attheendofevery league to
letthequeenknowhowhewas,and tofindouthowshefared. Ofeach
man ashecame sheasked what brought himback. Andoni-eceiving the
answer thathewascome tolearnhowshefared, thequeen beckoned the
messenger toherandsinned with him.Now thekingjounieyed twoand
thirty leagues andsenttwoandthirty messengers [438], andthequeen
sinned withthem all.Andwhen hehad pacified the frontier, tothe
great joy oftheinhabitants, hestarted onhishomeward journey, de-
spatching asecond series ofthirty-two messengers. And thequeen mis-
behaved with eachoneofthese, asbefore. Halting hisvictorious army
near thecity, tlieking sent aletter totheBodhisatta toprepare thecity
forhisentry. Thepreparations inthecitywere done, andtheBodhisatta
waspreparing thepalace fortheking's arrival, when hecame tothequeen's
apartments. Thesight ofhisgreat beauty somoved thequeen that she
called tohim tosatisfy her lust. ButtheBodliisatta pleaded with her,
urging thekijig's honour, andprotesting thatheshrank from allsinand
would notdoasshewished. "No thoughts oftheking frightened sixty-
four oftheking's messengers," said she;"and willyou fortheking's
sake feartodomywill 1"
Said theBodhisatta, "Had these messengers thought with me,they
would nothave acted thus. Asformethatknow theright, Iwillnot
commit this sin."
"Don't talk nonsense," said she. "Ifyou refuse, Iwillhave your
headchopped off."
"Sobeit.Cut offmyhead intliisorinahundred thousand exist-
ences;yetwill Inotdoyour l)idding."
"Allright ;Iwill see," said thequeen menacingly. And retiring to
herchamber, shescratched herself, i)ut oilonherlimbs, clad herself in
dirty clothes andfeigned tobeill.Then shesent forherslaves andbade
them telltheking,when heshould askafter her,thatshewas ill.
Meantime theBodliisatta hadgone tomeet the king, who, after
marching round thecity insolemn procession, entered hispalace. Not
seeing thequeen, hea.sked where shewas,andwas told thatshewas ill.
Entering theroyal bed-chamber, theking caressed thequeen andasked
what ailed her. Shewassilent ;butwhen thekingasked thethird time,
shelooked athimand said, "Though mylord theking still lives, yet
poorwomen likemehave toownamaster."
"What doyoumean ?"
"Thechaplain whom you lefttowatch over thecitycame hereon
pretence ofseeing after thepalace ;andbecause Iwould notyield tohis
will, [439] hebeatmetohisheart's content andwent off."

Then thekingfumed with rage, likethecrackling ofsaltorsugar in
the fire ;andherushed from thechamber. Calling hisservants, hebade
them bind thechaplain with hishands behind hixn, likeonecondemned
todeath, andcutoffhishead attheplace ofexecution. Soaway they
hurried andbound theBodhisatta. And thedrumwasbeaten toannounce
theexecution.
Thought theBodhisatta, "Doubtless thatwicked queen hasalready
poisoned theking's mind against me,andnowmust Isavemyself from
this peril." Sohesaid tohiscaptors, "Bringmeintotheking's presence
before you slayme.""Why so?" said they. "Because, astheking's
servant, Ihave toiled greatly ontheking's business, andknow where great
treasures arehidden which Ihave discovered. IfIamnotbrought before
theking, allthiswealth willbelost. Soleadmetohim,andthen do
your duty."
Accordingly, they brought him before theking, who asked why
reverence hadnotrestrained himfrom such wickedness.
"Sire," answered theBodhisatta, "Iwasborn abrahmin, andhave
never taken the lifesomuch asofanemmet orant. Ihave never taken
whatwasnotmyown, even toablade ofgrass. Never have Ilooked
with lustful eyesupon another man's wife. Noteven injesthave I
spoken falsely, and notadrop ofstrong drink have Iever drunk.
Innocent am I,sire ;butthatwicked woman tookmelustfully bythe

queen. And sheconfessed tohaving hadguilty converse with themen.
Then theking ordered offallthesixty-four tobebeheaded.
But atthispoint [440] theBodhisatta cried out,"Nay, sire,themen
arenottoblame ;fortheywere constrained bythequeen. Wherefore
pardon them. And asforthequeen:—she isnottoblame, forthe
jjassions ofwomen areinsatiate, andshedoes butactaccording toher

Upon thisentreaty thekingwasmerciful, andsotheBodhisatta saved

"Sire, thebaseless accusations offolly putthewise inunmerited bonds,

grew abeautiful Wishing Tree (also called theMukkhaka) with straight
stemandsjireading branches, which received great favour from theking.
Here dwelt onewhohadbeen amighty deva-king andhadbeenreborn a

Now theking's dwelling hadonly one pillar tosupport theroof

andthat pillar grew sbaky. Being told ofthis, theking sent forcar-
penters andordered them toput inasound pillar andmake itsecure.
Sothecarpenters [442] looked about foratree thatwould doand, not
finding oneelsewhere, went tothepleasaunce andsawtheMukkhaka.
Then away theywent back totheking. "Well," said he,"have you
found atreethat willdol" "Yes, sire," saidthey;"butwedon't liketo
fell it.""Why not?" saidtheking. Then they toldhimhowtheyhad
invainlooked everywhere foratreeanddidnot dai"e tocutdown the
sacred ti'ee. "Goandcut itdown," said he,"andmake theroof secure.
Iwilllookoutforanother tree."
Sotheywent away. And theytook asacrifice tothepleasaunce and
offered ittothe tree, saying among themselves thattheywould comeand
cut itdown next day. Hearing their words, theTree-sprite knew that
herhome would bedestroyed onthemorrow, andburst into tears asshe
clasped herchildren toherbreast, notknowing whither toflywiththem.
Her friends, thespirits ofthe forest, came andasked what thematter
was. Butnotoneofthem could devise how tostaythecarpenters' hand,
and allembraced herwith tearsandlamentations. Atthismoment up
came theBodhisatta tocallupon theTree-sprite andwas told thenews.
"Have nofear," saidtheBodhisatta cheerfully. "Iwill seethat thetree
isnotcutdown. Only waitand seewhat Iwilldowhen thecarpenters
come to-morrow."
Next daywhen themencame, theBodhisatta, assuming theshape ofa
chameleon, wasatthetreebefore they were, andgotinattherootsand
worked hiswayup tillhegotoutamong thebranches, making thetree
look full ofholes. Then theBodhisatta rested among theboughs with
hishead rapidly moving toand fro.Upcame thecarpenters; and at
sight ofthechameleon their leader struck thetreewith hishand, and
exclaimed that thetreewasrotten andthat they didn't look carefully
before making their offerings theday before. And offhewent full of
scorn forthegreat strong tx"ee. Inthisway theBodhisatta saved the
Tree-sprite's home. Andwhen allherfriends [443] andacquaintances

called that atrained elephant.
"Indeed heiswell trained, sire," saidthemahoiit. "No, heisvery

canyougethim toclimb tothesummit ofMount Vepulla?" "Yes, sire."

272 TlieJdtaka. Book I.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn intoarichbrahmin's family, andwhen hegrew up,was
versed inallknowledge andwasaworld-renowned professor with five
hundred young brahmins toinstruct.
Atthetime ofourstory there wasamong theyoung brahmins one
whoalways had foolish notions inhisheadandalways saidthewrong
thing; hewasengaged with therestinlearning thescriptures asapupil,
butbecause ofhisfolly could notmaster them. Hewasthedevoted
attendant oftheBodhisatta andministered tohim likeaslave.
Now onedayafter supper theBodhisatta laidhimself onhisbedand
therewaswashed andperfumed bytheyoung brahmin onhands, feetand
back. And astheyouth turned togoaway, theBodhisatta said tohim,
"Prop upthefeetofmybedbefore yougo."And theyoimg brahmin
propped upthefeet ofthebedononeside allright, butcould notfind
anything toprop itupwithontheother side. Accordingly heused his
legasapi'opandpassed thenight so.When theBodhisatta gotupin
themorning andsawtheyoung brahmin, heasked whyhewas sitting
there. "Master," said theyoung man,"Icould notfindoneofthel)ed
supports; soI'vegotmylegunder toprop itupinstead."
Moved atthese words, theBodhisatta thought, "What devotion!
And tothink itshould come from theveriest dullard ofallmypupils.
YethowcanIimpart learning tohim?" And thethought came tohim
thatthebestwaywastoquestion theyoung brahmin onhisreturn from
gathering firewood and leaves, astosomething hehadseen ordone that
day;andthen toaskwhat itwas like. [448] "Fox-," thought themaster,
"this willleadhimontomaking comparisons andgiving reasons, andthe
continuous practice ofcomparing andreasoning onhispart willenable me
toimpart learning tohim."
Accordingly hesent fortheyoung manandtoldhimalways onhis
return from picking upfirewood andleaves tosaywhat hehadseen or
eaten ordrunk. And theyoung manpromised hewould. Sooneday
having seen asnake when outwith theother pupils picking upwood in
the forest, hesaid,"Master, Isawasnake." "What did itlook like?"
"Oh, like theshaft ofaplough." "That isavery good comparison.
Snakes areliketheshafts ofploughs," saidtheBodhisatta, whobegan to
have hopes thathemight atlastsucceed with hispupil.
Another daytheyoung brahmin sawanelephant intheforest and
told hismaster. "And what isanelephant like?" "Oh, liketheshaft of
aplough." Hismaster saidnothing, forhethought that, astheelephant's
trunk andtusks bore acertain resemblance totheshaft ofaplough,
perhaps hispupil's stupidity made himspeak thus generally (though he
wasthinking ofthetrunk inparticular), because ofhisinability togo
intoaccurate detail,


No. 124. 273
Athird dayhewasinvited toeatsugar-cane, andduly told hismaster.
"And what isasugar-cane like?" "Oh, like theshaft ofaplough."
"That isscarcely agood comparison," thought hismaster, but said
nothing. Another day, again, thepupils were invited toeatmolasses
with curds andmilk, and thistoowasduly reported. "And what are
curds andmilk like?""Oh, like theshaft ofaplough." Then the
master thought tohimself, "This young manwasperfectly right insaying
asnake wasliketheshaft ofaplough, andwasmore orlessright, though
not accurate, insaying anelephant and asugar-cane hadthesame
similitude. Butmilkandcurds (which arealways white incolour) take
theshape ofwhatever vessel they areplaced in;[449] andherehemissed
thecomparison entirely. This dullard willnever learn." Sosaying he
uttered thisstanza:—
Foruniversal application he
Employs aterm oflimited import.
Plough-shaft andcurds tohim alikeunknown,—The foolasserts thetwothings arethesame.

was told,what their talkwas about. "This isnotthe first time, Brethren,"
said he,"that thisBrother hasbeen regular inthefulfilment ofduties. Indays
gonebyfivehundred hermits going outtogather fruits were supported onthe
fruits that hisgoodness provided." Sosaying, hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin intheNorth, and,growing iip,gaveup
theworld anddwelt atthehead offivehundred hermits atthefoot ofthe
mountains. Inthose days therecame agreat drought upon theHimalaya
country, andeverywhere thewater wasdried up,and sore distress fell
upon allbeasts. Seeing thepoor creatures suffering from thirst, one of
thehermits cutdown atreewhich hehollowed intoatrough;and this
trough hefilled with allthewater hecould find. Inthiswayhegave
theanimals todrink. Andtheycame inherds anddrank anddrank till
thehermit hadnotime lefttogoandgather fruits forhimself. Heed-
lessofhisownhunger, heworked away toquench theanimals' thirst.
Thought they tothemselves, "So wra2)t upisthishermit inministering
toourwants thatheleaves himself notime togoinquest offruits. He
must beveryhungry. Letusagree thateveryone ofuswhocomes here
todrink must bring such fruits ashecantothehermit." This they
agreed todo,every animal thatcame bringing mangoes orjambus or
bread-fruits orthelike, tilltheir ofierings would have filled twohundred
and fiftywaggons ;andtherewasfood forthewhole fivehundred hermits
withabundance tospare. Seeing this, theBodhisatta exclaimed, "Thus
hasoneman's goodness been themeans ofsupplying with food allthese
hermits. Truly, weshould always bestedfast inright-doing." Sosaying,
heuttered thisstanza:—
Toil on,mybrother ;still inhope stand fast;
Nor letthycourage flagand tire;
Forget nothim,whobyhisgrievous fast^
Reaped fruits beyond hisheart's desire.

"Ifhe'mid strangers."—This story wastoldbytheMaster while atJetavana,
about aboastful Brother. Theintroductory story about him islikewhat has
been already related ^
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenai'es, the
Bodhisatta wasarichTreasurer, andhiswife borehimason. Aiid the
selfsame dayafemale slave inhishouse gave birth toaboy,andthetwo
children gi-ew uptogether. Andwhen the richman's sonwasbeing
taught towrite, theyoimg slave used togowith hisyoung master's
tablets andsolearned atthesame time towrite himself. Next helearned
twoorthree handicrafts, andgrew vxptobeafair-spoken andhandsome
young man ;and hisname wasKatahaka. Being employed asprivate
secretary, hethought tohimself, "Ishall notalways bekept atthis
work. The slightest fault and Ishall bebeaten, imprisoned, branded,
andfedonslave's fare. Ontheborder there lives amerchant, afriend of
mymaster's. Why should Inotgotohimwith aletter purporting to
come frommymaster, and,passing myself offasmymaster's son,marry
themerchant's daughter and livehappily everafterwards %"
Sohewrote aletter, [452] saying, "The bearer ofthis ismyson. It
ismeet that ourhouses should beunited inmarriage, andIwould have
yougiveyourdaughter tothismysonandkeep theyoung couple nearyou
forthepresent. Assoon asIcanconveniently doso,Iwillcome toyou."
This letter hesealed with hismaster's private seal,andcame totheborder-
merchant's with awell-filled purse, handsome dresses, andperfumes and
the like.And with abowhestood before themerchant. "Where do
youcome from?" saidthemerchant. "From Benares." "Who isyour
father]" "TheTreasurer ofBenares." "And what brings youhere?"
"This letter will tellyou," saidKatahaka, handing ittohim. The
merchant readtheletter andexclaimed, "This givesmenew life."And
inhisjoyhegave hisdaughter toKatahaka and setuptheyoung couple,
who lived ingreat style. ButKatahaka gave himself airs,andused to
findfault with thevictuals andtheclothes thatwere brought him, calling
them "provincial." "These misguided provincials," hewould say, "have

noidea ofdressing. And asfortaste inscents andgarlands, they've got
none."
Missing hisslave, theBodhisatta said, "Idon't seeKatahaka. Where
hashegone 1Find him." And offwent theBodhisatta's people inquest
ofhim,andsearched farandwide tilltheyfound him. Then back they
came, without Katahaka recognizing them, andtoldtheBodhisatta.
"This willnever do," saidtheBodhisatta onhearing thenews. "I
willgoandbring himback." Soheasked theKing's permission, and
departed with agreat following. And thetidings spread everywhere that
theTreasurer wasonhiswaytotheborders. Hearing thenewsKatahaka
felltothinking ofhiscourse ofaction. Heknew thathewasthesole
reason oftheTreasurer's coming, andhesawthat torunawaynowwas to
destroy allchance ofreturning. Sohedecided togotomeet theTreasurer,
andconciliate himbyacting asaslave towards him asintheolddays.
Acting onthisplan, hemade apoint ofproclaiming in[453] public onall
occasions hisdisapprobation ofthelamentable decay ofrespect towards
parents which shewed itself inchildren's sitting down tomeals with their
parents, instead ofwaiting upon them. ""Whenmyparents take their
meals," saidKatahaka, "Ihand theplates anddishes, bring thespittoon,
andfetch their fans forthem. Such ismyinvariable practice." Andhe
explained carefully aslave's duty tohismaster, such asbringing thewater
andministering tohimwhen heretired. And having already schooled
folk ingeneral, hehadsaid tohisfather-in-law shortly before thearrival of
theBodhisatta, "Ihearthatmyfather iscoming toseeyou.Youhadbetter
make ready toentertain him,while Iwillgoandmeethimontheroad
with apresent." "Doso,mydear boy," said hisfather-in-law.
SoKatahaka took amagnificent present andwent outwith alarge
retinue tomeet theBodhisatta, towhom hehanded thepresent with alow
obeisance. TheBodhisatta took thepresent inakindly way, and at
breakfast timemade hisencampment and retired forthepurposes of
nature. Stopping hisretinue, Katahaka tookwater andapproached the
Bodhisatta. Then theyoung man fellattheBodhisatta's feetand cried,
"Oh, sir,Iwillpayanysumyoumayrequire;butdonotexpose me."
"Fearnoexposure atmyhands," saidtheBodhisatta, pleased athis
dutiful conduct, andentered intothe city,where hewasfeted with great
magnificence. AndKatahaka stillacted ashisslave.
AstheTreasurer satathisease, theborder-merchant said,"My Lord,
upon receipt ofyour letter Idulygavemydaughter inmarriage toyour
son." And theTreasurer made asuitable reply about 'hisson' inso
kindly awaythat themerchant wasdelighted beyond measure. Butfrom
thattime forth theBodhisatta could notbear thesight ofKatahaka.
OnedaytheGreat Being sent forthemerchant's daughter and said,
"Mydear, please lookmyhead over." Shedid so,andhethanked herfor

hermucli-needed services, [454] adding, "And now tellme,mydear,
whether myson isareasonable man inwealandwoe,andwhether you
manage togetonwellwithhim."
"Myhusband hasonlyone fault. Hewillfind fault with hisfood."
"He hasalways hadhisfaults,mydear; butIwill tellyouhow to
stop histongue. Iwill tellyouatextwhich youmust learn carefully and
repeat toyourhusband when hefinds fault again with hisfood." Andhe
taught herthelinesandshortly afterwards setoutforBenares. Katahaka
accompanied hirapart oftheway,andtook hisleave after offering most
valuable presents totheTreasurer. Dating from thedeparture ofthe
Bodhisatta, Katahaka waxed prouder andprouder. Oneday hiswife
ordered anice dinner, andbegan tohelphim toitwith aspoon, butat
the firstmouthful Katahaka began togrumble. Thereon themerchant's
daughter i-emembering herlesson, repeated thefollowing stanza :—
Ifhe'mid strangers farfromhome talks big^,
Back comes hisvisitor tospoil itall.—Come, eatyour dinner then, Katahaka^.
"Dearme,"thought Katahaka, "theTreasurer must haveinformed her
ofmyname, andhave toldherthewhole story." And from thatday
forth hegave himself uomore airs,buthuDibly atewhat was setbefore
him,andathisdeath passed away tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

'''Ticas greed."... Thin storywastoldbytheMaster while atJetavaua, about
another hypocrite.
Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
sattawasKing oftheRatsanddwelt intheforest. Now afirebroke out
intheforest, andajackal whocould notrunaway puthishead against a
tree[462] and lettheflames sweep byhim. The tiresinged thehair otF
hisbody everywhere, and lefthim perfectly bald, except foratuft likea
scalp- knot^ where thecrown ofhisheadwas pressed against the tree.
Drinking onedayinarocky pool,hecaught sight ofthistop-knot reflected
inthewater. "At lastI'vegotwherewithal togotomarket," thought he.
Coming inthecourse ofhiswanderings intheforest totherats' cave, he
said tohimself, "I'llhoodwink those ratsanddevour them;" andwith this
intent hetookuphisstand hard by,just asintheforegoing story.
Onhiswayoutinquest offood, theBodhisatta observed thejackal
and, crediting thebeast with virtue andgoodness, came tohimandasked
what hisname was.
"Bharadvaja-, Votary oftheFire-God."
"Why haveyoucome here?"
"Inorder toguard youandyours."
"What willyoudotoguard us?"
"Iknowhow tocount onmyAngers, and willcount yournumbers
bothmorning andevening, soastobesure that asmany camehome at
night, aswent outinthemorning. That's how I'llguard you."
"Then stay, uncle, andwatch over us."
And accordingly, astheratswere starting inthemorning hesetabout
counting them "One, two,three;" and soagainwhen theycame back at
night. Andevery time hecounted them, heseized andatethehindmost.
Everything came topass asintheforegoing story, except thathere the
King oftheRats turned and said tothejackal, "It isnot sanctity,

"What isthematter with you,mydear?" saidherhusband.
"Wind troubles me."
"What can Igetforyou?"
"Sweets, savouries, rich food, rice-gi'uel, boiled-rice, oil,andsoforth."
Theobedient husband didasshewished, andtoiled likeaslave forher. She

"Mypoorwifedoesn't seem togetanybetter ofthewind," thought thebrahmin
atlast,andbetook himself with offerings ofpeifumes, flowers, andthe like, to
theMaster atJetavana. Hisobeisance done, hestood before theBlessed One,

Benares. Tohim flocked aspupils theyoung nobles andbrahmins from
alltheprincely andwealthy families. Now acountry brahmin, whohad
learned from theBodhisatta thethree Vedas, andtheeighteen Sciences,
andwhostopped oninBenares tolook after hisestate, came two or
three times every daytolisten totheBodhisatta's teachings. [464] And
thisbrahmin hadawifewhowasabad,wicked woman. And everything
came topass asabove. When thebrahmin explained how itwasthathe
could notgetaway tolisten tohismaster's teachings, theBodhisatta, who
knew that thebrahmin's wifewasonly feigning sickness, thought tohim-
self,"Iwill tellhimwhat physic willcure thecreature." Sohesaid to
thebrahmin, "Get hernomore dainties, myson,butcollect thestalings

been ungrateful; hewasjustasungrateful inbygone days." Sosaying, hetold
thisstory ofthepast.
[4G6] Once onatime,when acertain king ofMagadha wasreigning in
Rfijagaha, theBodbisatta was hisTreasurer, worth eighty ci'ores, and
known asthe 'Millionaire.' InBenares there dwelt aTreasurer also
worth eighty crores, whowasnamed Piliya, andwasagreat friend ofthe
Millionaire. Forsome reason orother Piliya ofBenares gotinto difficiilties,
and lost allhisproperty, andwasreduced tobeggary. Inhisneedheleft
Benares, andwith hiswifejourneyed onfoot toBajagaha, toseethe
Millionaire, thelasthope lefthim.And theMillionaire embraced his
friend andtreated him asanhonoured guest, asking, induecourse, the
reason ofthevisit. "Iamaruined man," answered Piliya, "Ihave lost
everything, andhavecome toaskyoutohelpme."
"With allmyheart !Have nofearonthat score," saidtheMillionaire.
Hehad hisstrong-room opened, andgave toPiliya forty crores. Alsohe
divided intotwoequal parts thewhole ofhisproperty, livestock and all,
andbestowed onPiliya thejust half ofhisentire fortune. Taking his
wealth, Piliya wentback toBenares, andthere dwelt.
Notlong after alikecalamity overtook theMillionaire, who, inhis
turn, lostevery penny hehad. Casting aboiit whither toturn inthehour
ofneed, hebethought himhowhehadbefriended Piliya tothehalf ofhis
possessions, andmight gotohim forassistance without fearofbeing thi-own
over. Sohesetoutfrom Rajagaha with hiswife,andcame toBenares.
Attheentrance tothecityhesaid toher,"Wife, itisnotbefitting for
you totrudge along thestreets with me.Wait here alittle tillIsend

saying, heleftherunder shelter, andwent onalone into thetown, till
hecame toPiliya's house, where hebade himself beannounced asthe
Millionaire from Rajagaha, come toseehisfriend.
"Well, showhim in,"saidPiliya; butatsight oftheother's condition
heneither rosetomeet him,norgreeted himwithwords ofwelcome, but
onlydemanded what brought him here.

"There's noroom here foryou. Take adole ofrice, findsomewhere to

saying, therichman despatched aservant with orders togive hisun-
fortunate friend halfa-quartern ofpollard tocarryaway tiedupinthe

nowdoled outhalf-a-quartern ofpollard tohisbenefactor !Accordingly,
theservant measured outthepollard inabasket, andbrought ittothe
Bodhisatta, whoargued within himself whether ornoheshould take it.And
hethought, "This ingrate breaks offour fi-iendship because Iamaruined
man. Now, ifIrefuse hispaltry gift, Ishallbeasbadashe.Forthe
ignoble, whoscorn amodest gift,outrage the firstidea offriendship. Be

"What haveyougot,dearl" said she.
"Our friend Piliya gives usthispollard, andwashes hishands ofus."
"Oh,why didyoutake if? Isthis afitreturn fortheforty

"Don't cry,dear wife," saidtheBodhisatta. "Itook itsimply because
Iwanted not toviolate theprinciple offriendship. Why these tears?"

former mistress. Recognising hismaster and mistress, hefellattheir
feet,andwith tearsandsobsasked thereason oftheir coming. And the
Bodhisatta toldhimtheir story.
"Keep upyour spirits," said theman, cheei'ily; and,taking them to
hisown dwelling, theremade ready perfumed baths, andameal forthem.
Then helettheother slaves know that their oldmaster andmistress had

"Isthissol" saidtheking toPiliya.
"Yes, sire," said he.
"And when, inhistui'n, your benefactor confided inyouandsought

Here Piliya was silent.
"Did youhave ahalf-quartern ofpollard doled outintothecorner of

[469] Still Piliya was silent.
Then theking took counsel with hisministers astowhat should be
done, and finally, asajudgment onPiliya, ordered them togotoPiliya's
house andgivethewhole ofPiliya's wealth totheMillionaire.
"Nay, sire," saidtheBodhisatta;"Ineed notwhat isanother's. Let

upon thecharms oftheogresses, hewould have perished miserably, nor
everhave lived toseehispresent magnificence, which heowed tohis
following thecounsels ofthePacceka Buddlias. And asthese thoughts
filled hisheart, hisemotion found vent inthese verses:

and Sundari-nauda. The Bodhisatta dying, they were taken inby
neighbours and friends, whilst hewasborn again into theworld asa
golden mallard endowed with consciousness ofitsformer existences.
Growing up,thebirdviewed itsownmagnificent sizeandgolden plumage,
andremembered that previously ithadbeen ahuman being. Discovering
that hiswifeanddaughters were living onthecharity ofothers, the
mallard bethought himofhisplumage likehammered andbeaten goldand
howbygiving them agolden feather atatimehecould enable hiswife
anddaughters toliveincomfort. Soaway heflew towhere theydwelt
andalighted onthe tO})oftliecentral beam ofthe roof. Seeing the
Bodhisatta, [476] thewifeand girlsasked where hehadcome from; and
hetoldthem that hewas their father whohad diedandbeen born
agolden mallard, andthathehadcome tovisitthem andputanend
totheir miserable necessity ofworking forhire. "You shall havemy
feathers," said he,"onebyone,andthey will sellforenough tokeepyou
allineaseandcomfort." Sosaying, hegavethem oneofhisfeathers and
departed. And from time totime hereturned togivethem another
feather, andwith theproceeds oftheir sale these brahmin-women grew
prosperous andquite well-to-do. Butonedaythemother said toher
daughters, "There's notrusting animals, mychildren. Who's tosayyour
father might notgoaway oneofthese daysandnever come back again?
Letususeourtimeandpluck himclean nexttime hecomes, soasto
make sure ofallhisfeathers." Thinking thiswould pain him, the
daughters refused. Themother inhergreed called thegolden mallard to
heronedaywhen hecame, andthen tookhimwith both hands and
plucked him.Now theBodhisatta's feathers had thisproperty that if

became like acrane's feathers. Andnow thepoor l)ii'd, though he
stretched hiswings, could not fly,andthewoman flunghimintoabarrel
andgave him food there. Astimewent onhisfeathers grew again
(though theywere plain white onesnow), andheflewaway tohisown
abode andnever came back again.
Attheclose ofthisstory theMaster said,"Thus you see.Brethren, howFat

another wife,andatthenews hisfoi-mcr wife fella-weeping. Knowing allthis,
theMaster putonhisrobes early inthemorning andwent with hisalms-bowl to
thehouse ofKana's motlier andsatdown ontheseat setforhim.Then heasked
whythedaughter wascrying, and,being told,spoke words ofconsolation tothe
mother, andaroseandwentback totheMonastery.
Now theBi'ethren came toknowhowKana hadbeen stopped three times
from going back toherhusband owing totheaction ofthefourBrothers ;and
onedaytheymetintheHall ofTruth andbegan totalkabout tliematter. The
Miister came intotheHall [478]andasked what theywere discussing, andthey
told him. "Brethren," said he,"think not this isthe firsttime those four
Brothers havebrought sorrow onKana's mother byeating ofherstore ;they did
thelike indaysgonebytoo." Sosaying hetold thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn astone-cutter, andgrowing upbecame expert in
working stones. Now intheKasi country there dwelt avery richmer-
chantwhohadamassed forty crores ingold. Andwhen hiswife died, so
strong washerlove ofmoney that shewas re-born amouse anddwelt
over thetreasure. And onebyonethewhole family died, including the
mei'chant himself. Likewise thevillage became deserted andforlorn. At
thetime ofourstory theBodhisatta wasquarrying andshaping stones
onthesiteofthisdeserted village; andthemouse used often toseehimas
sheranabout tofind food. Atlast she fellinlove with him; and,
bethinking herhowthesecret ofallhervastwealth would diewith her,she
conceived theidea ofenjoying itwith him. Soonedayshecame tothe
Bodhisatta with acoin inhermouth. Seeing this, hespoke toher
kindly, and said, "Mother, what hasbrought youherewith thiscoinT'
"It isforyou tolayoutforyoui-self, and tobuymeat with formeas
well,mysou." Nowise loth,hetook themoney andspent ahalfpenny of
itonmeat which hebrought tothemouse, whodeparted andatetoher
heart's content. And thiswent on,themouse giving theBodhisatta a
coinevery day,andheinreturn su})plying herwith meat. But itfell
outonedaythatthemouse wascaught byacat.
"Don't killme," saidthemouse.
"Why not 1"saidthecat. "I'mashungry ascanbe,andreally must
killyoutoallay thepangs."
"First, tellmewliether you're always hungry, oronlyhungry today."
"Oh,every dayfindsmehungry again."
"Well then, ifthisbeso,Iwill findyoualways inmeat; [479] only
letmesro,"


296 TheJataka. Book I.
"Mind youdothen," saidthecat,and letthemouse go.
Asaconsequence ofthisthemouse hadtodivide thesupplies ofmeat
shegotfi'om theBodhisatta intotwoportions andgaveonehalf tothecat,
keeping theother forherself.
Now, asluckwould have it,thesamemouse wascaught another day
byasecond catandhadtopurchase herrelease onthesame terms. So
now thedaily foodwasdivided into three portions. Andwhen athird
catcaught themouse andalikearrangement hadtobemade, thesupply
wasdivided intofour portions. And later afourth catcaught her,andthe
foodhad tobedivided among five, sothat themouse, reduced tosuch
short coinmons, grew sothin astobenothing butskinand bone.
Remarking howemaciated hisfriend wasgetting, theBodhisatta asked the
reason. Then themouse toldhim allthathadbefallen her.
"Why didn't you tellmeallthisbefore?" saidtheBodhisatta. "Cheer
lip, I'llhelpyououtofyour troubles." Sohetook ablock ofthepurest
crystal andscooped outacavity initandmade themouse getinside.
"Now stop there," said he,"and don't failtofiercely threaten and revile
allwhocome near."
Sothemouse crept intothecrystal cellandwaited. Upcame oneof
thecatsanddemanded hismeat. "Away, vilegrimalkin," saidthemouse;
"why should Isupply you? gohome and eatyour kittens!" Infuriated
atthese words, andnever suspecting themouse tobeinside thecrystal,
thecatsprang atthemouse toeatherup ;and sofurious was itsspring
that itbroke thewalls ofitschest and itseyes started from itshead.
Sothat catdiedand itscarcase tumbled down outofsight. And the
like fateinturn befell allfour cats.And ever after thegrateful mouse
brought theBodhisatta twoorthree coins instead ofoneasbefore, andby
degrees shethusgavehimthewhole ofthehoard. Inunbroken friend-
ship thetwo lived together, tilltheir lives ended andthey passed away
tofareaccording totheir deserts.
Thestory told, theMaster, asBuddha, uttered thisstanza:—[480]
Give food toone cat,Number Two appears:
Athird andfourth succeed iufruitful line;—Witness thefour thatbythecrystal died.
Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "These four
Brethren were thefour cats ofthose days, Kaiia's mother wasthemouse, and I
thestone-cutter."

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, theBodhi-
satta wasborn alizard; and inahutbardbyavillage ontheborders
there lived arigid ascetic whohadattained theFiveKnowledges, andwas
treated withgreat respect bythevillagers. Inanant-hill attheendofthe
walk whei-e therecluse paced upanddown, dwelt theBodhisatta, and
twice orthrice eachdayhewould gototherecluse andhearwords of
edification and holiness. Then withdueobeisance tothegoodman, the
Bodhisatta would depart tohisown abode. After acertain time the
ascetic bade farewell tothevillagers andwent away. Inhisstead there
came another ascetic, arascally fellow, todwell inthehermitage. Assum-
ingtheholiness ofthenew-comer, theBodhisatta acted towards himasto
the first ascetic. Onedayanunexpected storm inthedryseason brought
outtheantsontheir hills", andthelizards, coming abroad toeatthem, were
caught ingreatnumbers [481] bythevillage folk; andsomewere served up
with vinegar andsugar fortheascetic toeat. Pleased with sosavoury a
dish, heasked what itwas,andlearned that itwasadish oflizards.
Hereon hereflected thathehadaremarkably finelizard ashisneighbour,
and resolved todine offhim. Accordingly hemade ready thepotfor

with amallet hidden under hisyellow robe, awaiting theBodhisatta's

came, andashedrew near,marked thatthehermit didnotseem quite the
same, buthadalook about him that Ijoded nogood. Snuffing upthe
windwhich wasblowing towards himfrom thehermit's cell,theBodhisatta
smelt thesmell oflizard's flesh, and atonce realised how thetaste of
lizard hadmade theascetic want tokillhimwith amallet and eathim
up.Soheretired homeward without calling ontheascetic. Seeing that
theBodliisatta didnotcome, theascetic judged thatthelizard must have
divined hisplot, butmarvelled howhecould have discovered it.Deter-
mined that thelizard should notescape, hedrew outthemallet andthrew

dashed into hisfastness, andputting hishead outbyadifferent hole to
thatbywhich hehadgone in,cried, "Rascally hypocrite, your garb of
piety ledmetotrust you,butnowIknow your villainous nature. What
hasathief likeyoutodowith hermit's clothing?"Thus upbraiding the
false ascetic, theBodhisatta lecited thisstanza:—
With matted hairandgarb ofskin
Why ape tli'ascetic's piety?
Asaint without, thyheart within
Ischoked with foulimpurityi.
[482] Inthiswise didtheBodhisatta expose thewicked ascetic, after
which heretired into hisant-hill. And thewicked ascetic departed from
that place.

"ZTw hlinding and herheating."—This story theIMaster toldwhile atthe
Bamboo Grove, about Devadatta. WehearthattheBrethren, meeting together
intheHall ofTruth, spoke onewith another, saying thateven asatorch from a

seeing thathehadmissed thecomforts ofalay lifeyethadfallen short ofhis

Entering theHall, theMaster asked andwas toldwhat theBrethren were
talking oftogether. "Yes, Brethren," said he,"and sotooindays gone by
Devadatta came tojustsuch another two-fold failure." Sosaying, hetoldthis
story ofthepast.

histackle went offwith liis little boy,and cast hishook into themost
likely waters known tohisfellow-fishermen. Now [483] asnagcaught
hishook andthefisherman could notpnll itnp."What atine fish!"
thought he. "I'd better sendmyboy offhome tomywifeand tellherto

ashegroped about forthe fish,hestruck against thesnagandputout

"In ceaseless dread."—This storywas t(jldbytheMaster while atJetavaua,
about asagacious counsellor. Theincidents willberelated inthetwelfth book
inconnection with theBhaddasala-jatakai.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodliisatta wasborn acrow. OnedaytheKing's chaplain went out
from the city tothe river, bathed there, andhaving perfumed and
garlanded himself, donned hisbravest array andcame back tothecity.On
thearchway ofthecitygatethere sattwocrows ;andoneofthem said to
hismate, "Imean tofoul thisbrahmin's head." "Oh, don't doanysuch
thing," saidtheother; "for thisbrahmin isagreat man,and itisanevil
thing toincur thehatred ofthegreat. Ifyouanger him,hemaydestroy
thewhole ofourkind." "Ireally must," saidthe first. "Very well,
you're sure tobefound out," saidtheother, andflewquickly away. Just
when thebrahmin wasunder thebattlements, down dropped the filth
uponhim asifthecrow were dropping afestoon. Theenraged brahmin
forthwith conceived hatred against allcrows.
Now atthistime itchanced thatafemale slave incharge ofagranary
spread thericeoutinthesunatthegranary doorandwassitting there to
watch it,when she fellasleep. Justthenupcame ashaggy goatand fell
toeating therice tillthegirlwoke upanddrove itaway. Twice orthree
times thegoatcame back, assoon asshe fellasleep, and atethe rice.
[485] Sowhen shehaddriven thecreature away forthethird time she
bethought herthatcontinued visits ofthegoatwould consume halfherstore
ofriceandthat stepsmust betaken toscare theanimal away forgood
andsosave herfrom sogreat aloss. Soshetook alighted torch, and,
sitting down, pretended tofallasleep asusual. Andwhen thegoatwas
eating, shesuddenly sprang upandhit itsshaggy back with hertorch.
Atonce thegoat's shaggy hide w^as allablaze, and toease itspain, it
dashed intoahay-shed near theelephant's stable and rolled inthehay.
Sotheshed caught fireandtheflames spread tothe stables. Asthese
stables caught fire,theelephants began tosufier, andmany ofthem were
badly burnt beyond theskill oftheelephant-doctors tocure.When this

wasreported totheKing, heasked hischaplain whether heknew what
would cure theelephants. "Certainly Ido,sire," said thechaplain, and
being pressed toexplain, saidhisnostrum wascrows' fat.Then theKing
ordered crows tobekilled andtheir fattaken. Andforthwith therewas
agreat slaughter ofcrows, butnever wasany fatfound onthem, andso
they Avent onkilling tilldead crows layinheaps everywhere. And a
great fearwasupon allcrows.
Now inthose days theBodhisatta hadhisdwelling inagreat cemetery,
atthehead ofeighty thousand crows. One ofthese brought tidings to
him ofthefear thatwasupon thecrows. And theBodhisatta, feeling
that there wasnone buthimwho could essay thetask, resolved tofree
hiskinsfolk from their great dread. Reviewing theTen Perfections,
and selecting therefrom Kindness ashisguide, heflewwithout stopping
right u})totheKing's palace, and entering inattheopenwindow
alighted underneath theKing's throne. Straightway aservant tried to
catch thebird,buttheKing entering thechamber forbade him.
Recovering himself inamoment, theGreat Being, remembering
Kindness, came forth frombeneath theKing's throne andspoke thus to
theKing;— "Sire, aking should remember themaxim thatkings should
notwalk according tolustandother evilpassions inruling theirkingdoms.
Before taking action, itismeet first toexamine andknow thewhole
matter, andthenonly todothatwhich being done issalutary. Ifkings
dothatwhich being done isnot salutary, tliey filltliousands with a
great fear, even thefear ofdeath. [486] And inprescribing crows'
fat,your cha})lain wasprompted byrevenge tolie; forcrows have
nofat."
Bythese words theKing's heart waswon,andhebade theBodhisatta
besetonathrone ofgoldandthere anointed beneath thewings with the
choicest oilsandserved invessels ofgoldwith theKing's ownmeats and
drink. Thenwhen theGreat Being was filledandatease, theKing said,
"Sage, yousaythatcrows have nofat.How comes itthat theyhave
nonel"
"Inthiswise," answered theBodhisatta with avoice that filled the
whole palace, andheproclaimed theTruth inthisstanza:—
Inceaseless dread, with allmankind forfoes,
Their life ispassed; andhence nofathave crows.
This explanation given, tlieGreat Being taught theKing, saying,
"Sire, kings should never actwithout examining andknowing thewhole
matter." Well pleased, theKing laidhiskingdom attheBodhisatta's feet,
buttheBodhisatta restored ittotheKing,whom heestablished inthe
Five Precepts, beseeching him toshield allliving creatures from harm.
And theKing wasmoved bythese words togrant immunity toallliving

clayhehad sixbushels ofricecooked forthem and delicately flavoured,
and thiswasgiven tothecrows. But totheGreat Being there was
given foodsuch astheKing alone ate.

[487] ''Bad company."—This stoi-y was toldbytheMaster while atthe
Bamboo-grove, about atraitorous Brother. The introductory incident isthe
same asthat toldintheMahila-mukha-jataka^.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasbornaniguana. When hegrewuphedwelt inabigburrow
intheriver bank with afollowing ofmany hundreds ofother iguanas.
Now theBodhisatta hadason,ayoung iguana, who Avasgreat friends
with achameleon, whom heiised toclipandembrace. Thisintimacy being
reported totheiguana king, hesent forhisyoung sonandsaidthatsuch
friendship wasmisplaced, forchameleons werelowcreatures, andthat ifthe
intimacy waspersisted in,calamity would befall thewhole ofthetribe of
iguanas. And heenjoined hissontohave nomore todowith the
chameleon. But thesoncontinued inhisintimacy. Again andagain
didtheBodhisatta speak with hisson,butfinding hiswords ofnoavail,
andforeseeing danger totheiguanas from thechameleon, hehadanoutlet
cutononeside oftheir burrow, sothatthere might beameans ofescape
intime ofneed.
Now astimewent on,theyoung iguana gi'ew toagreat size, whilst
thechameleon never grew any bigger. And asthese mountainous em-
braces oftheyoung giant grew painful indeed, thechameleon foresaw

thattheywould bethedeath ofhim iftheywent onafewdays longer,
andheresolved tocombine with ahunter todestroy thewhole tribe of
iguanas.
Onedayinthesummer theantscame outafter athunder-storm", and
[488] theiguanas darted hither andthither catching them and eating
them. Now there came intotheforest aniguana trapper withspade and
dogs todigoutiguanas ;and thechameleon thought what ahaulhe
would put inthetrappei''s way. Sohewent uptotheman, and, lying
down before him, asked why hewasabout inthe forest. "To catch
iguanas," was the reply, "Well, Iknow where there's aburrow of
hundreds ofthem," said thechameleon; "bring fireandbrushwood and
follow me."And hebrought thetrapper towhere theiguanas dwelt.
"Now," said thechameleon, "put your fuel inthere andsmoke the
iguanas out. Meantime letyour dogsbeallround andtakeabigstick in
your hand. Then astheiguanas dash out, strike themdown andmake a
pileoftheslain." Sosaying, thetreacherous chameleon withdrew toa
spothard by,where helaydown, with hishead up,saying tohimself,—
"ThisdayIshall seetheroutofmyenemy."
Thetrapper settowork tosmoke theiguanas out;andfear fortheir
lives drove them helter-skelter from their burrow. Astheycame out,the
trapper knocked them onthehead, and ifhemissed them, they fell
aprey tohisdogs. And sotherewasgreat slaughter among theiguanas.
Realising that thiswasthechameleon's doing, theBodhisatta cried, "One
should never make friends ofthewicked, forsuch bring sorrow intheir
train.Asingle wicked chameleon hasproved thebane ofallthese
iguanas." Sosaying, heescaped bytheoutlet hehadprovided, uttering
thisstanza:—
Badcompany cannever end ingood.
Through friendship withone solechameleon
The ti'ibe ofiaruanas met their end.
[489] Hislesson ended, theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Devadatta

young iguana, thesonoftheBodhisatta; and Imyself theking oftheiguanas."

asDevadatta acted now, soheacted intimes gone by,yetfailed—tohisown
grievous hurt—ofhiswicked purpose. And sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthe

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the

Bodhisatta came upandmarked thepretended corpse. Suspecting the
fraud, hedetermined tosiftthematter. Sohewent round totheleeside
andknew bythescent thatthemanwasnotreally dead. Resolving to
make theman look foolish before leaving him, theBodhisatta stole near
andtook hold oftheclubwith histeeth andtugged atit.The rascal
didnotleave go :notperceiving theBodhisatta's approach, he[490]

"Voiirmangled corpseP—This story was toldbytheMaster while atthe

Forwhen hisspiritual Insight lefthimandhelostthehonour andprofit which

This being refused, hemade aschism intheBrotherhood anddeparted to
Gayaslsa with fivehundred young Brethren, pupils oftheBuddha's twochief
disciples, butasyetunversed intheLawandtheRule. With thisfollowing he
performed theactsofaseparate Brotherhood gathered together within thesame
precincts. Knowing wellthetimewhen theknowledge ofthese young Brethren
should ripen, theMaster sent thetwoElders tothem. Seeing these, [491]
Devadatta joyfully settowork expounding farinto thenight with (ashe

hesaid,"The assembly, reverend Sariputta, isstill alertand sleepless. Willyou

Said theMaster toSariputta, "What wasDevadatta doing when yougot
there1"And Sariputta answered that, though posing asaBuddha, evilhad
befallen him. SaidtheMaster, "Even asnow, Sariputta, soinformer times too
hasDevadatta imitated metohisown hurt." Then, attheElder's request, he
told thisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasamaned lionanddwelt atGoldDen intheHimalayas.
Bounding forth onedayfrom his lair,helooked North andWest, South
andEast, androared aloud ashewent inquest ofprey. Slaying alarge
buffalo, hedevoured theprime ofthecarcass, afterwhich hewentdown to
apool, andhaving drunk his fillofcrystal water turned togotowards
hisden.Now ahungry jackal, suddenly meeting the lion,andbeing
unable tomake hisescape, threw himself atthelion's feet. Being asked
what hewanted, thejackal replied, "Lord, letmebethy servant."
"Very well," saidthelion; "serve meandyoushall feedonprime meat."
Sosaying, hewent with thejackal following toGold Den. Thenceforth
the lion's leavings felltothejackal, andhegrew fat.
Lying onedayinhisden,thelion toldthejackal toscan thevalleys
from themountain top, toseewhether there wereanyelephants orhorses
orbuffalos about, oranyother animals [492] ofwhich he,thejackal, was
fond. Ifanysuchwere insight, thejackal wastoreport andsaywithdue
obeisance, "Shine forth inthymight, Lord." Then thelionpromised to
killand eat,giving apart tothejackal. Sothejackal used toclimb the
heights, andwhenever heespied below beasts tohistaste, hewould report
ittothelion,andfalling athisfeet, say,"Shine forth inthymight, Lord."
Hereon thelionwould nimbly bound forth and slaythebeast, even ifit
were arutting elephant, andshare theprime ofthe cai'cass with the
jackal. Glutted with hismeal, thejackal would then retire tohisdenand
sleep.
Now astimewent on,thejackal grew bigger andbigger tillhegi-ew
haughty. "Have notItoofour legs'?" heasked himself. "Why amIa
pensioner daybydayonothers' bounty? Henceforth /will killelephants
andother beasts, formyown eating. The lion,king ofbeasts, only kills
them because oftheformula, 'Shine forth inthymight, Lord.' I'llmake
thelion callouttome,'Shine forth inthymight, jackal,' andthen I'llkill
anelephant formyself." Accordingly hewent tothe lion,andpointing
outthathehadlong lived onwhat thelionhad killed, told hisdesire to
eatanelephant ofhisown killing, ending with arequest tothelion tolet
him, thejackal, couch inthelion's corner inGoldDenwhilst thelionwas
toclimb themountain tolookoutforanelephant. Thequarry found, he
asked thatthelionshould come tohim inthedenand say,'Shine forth in

ever seen ajackal able tocopewiththem. Giveupthisfancy, andcon-
tinue tofeedonwhat Ikill." Butsaywhat thelion could, thejackal
would notgiveway,and still pressed hisrequest. Soatlastthelion
gave way,andbidding thejackal couch intheden,climbed thepeakand
thence espied anelephant inrut. Eeturning tothemouth ofthecave,
hesaid, "Shine forth inthymight, jackal." Then fromGoldDen the
jackal [493] nimbly bounded forth, looked around himonallfour sides,
and, thrice raising itshowl, sprang attheelephant, meaning tofasten on
itshead. Butmissing hisaim,healighted attheelephant's feet. The
infuriated brute raised itsright footandcrushed the jackal's head,
trampling thebones intopowder. Then pounding thecarcass intoamass,
anddunging upon it,theelephant dashed trumpeting into the forest.
Seeing allthis, theBodhisatta observed, "Now shine forth inthymight,
jackal," anduttered thisstanza:—
Your mangled corpse, your brains mashed into clay,
Prove howyou've shone forth inyoiu*might to-day.
Thus spake theBodhisatta, and living toagood oldagehepassed
away inthefulness oftime tofareaccording tohisdeserts.

thejackal ofthose days,and Ithelion."

profit bysuch austerities ;but,finding themselves nobetter foralltheir sacrifices
toFireandforallsimilar practices, straightway doused thebirth-fire withwater
till itwent out.ByanactofMeditation theKnowledges andAttainments were
gained andatitlewon totheBrahma Realm." Sosaying hetold thisstory of
thepast.
[494] Onceonatimewhen Brahmadatta wasreigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn abrahmin intheNorth country, andonthedayof
hisbirth hisparents litabirth-fire.
Inhissixteenth yearthey addressed him thus, "Son, onthedayof
your birthwelitabirth-fire foryou.Now therefore choose. Ifyouwish
toleadafamily life,learn theThree Vedas; but ifyouwish toattain to
theBrahma Realm, take your firewith you into the forest andthere
tend it,soastowinMaha-Brahma's favour andhereafter toenter into
theBrahma Realm."
Telling hisparents that afamily lifehadnocharms forhim,hewent
into theforest anddwelt inahermitage tending his fire.Anoxwas

Lord ofFire could noteathismeat-ofi"ering without it,heresolved to
gobackandbring asupply from thevillage forthepurpose. Sohetiedup
theoxand set oflTagain tothevillage.
While hewasgone, aband ofhunters came upand, seeing theox,
killed itandcooked themselves adinner. Andwhat theydidnoteatthey
carried off,leaving only the tailand hideandtheshanks. Finding
only these sorry remains onhisreturn, thebrahmin exclaimed, "As
thisLord ofFirecannot somuch aslook after hisown,how shall helook
afterme ?Itisawaste oftime toserve him, bringing neither good nor
profit." Having thus lost alldesire toworship Fire, hesaid—"MyLord of
Fire, ifyoucannot manage toprotect yourself, how shallyou protect me?

children. Potthapada wastheBodhisatta's name, andRadha hisbrother's.
Now thebrahmin hadaboldbadwife.And ashewasleaving home

minded tobenaughty, stop her." "Wewill,papa," saidtheBodhisatta, "if

Having thus entrusted hiswife totheparrots' charge, thebi^ahmin set
outonhisbusiness. Every daythenceforth hiswifemisconducted herself;
there wasnoend tothestream ofherlovers inandoutofthehouse.
Moved bythesight,Radha said totheBodhisatta, "Brother, theparting

And forthereasons thus given, theBodhisatta didnotallow his
brother tospeak tothebrahmin's wife,whocontinued togadabout toher

asked Potthapada about hiswife's conduct, andtheBodhisatta faithfully

"Why, father," hesaid,"should youhaveanything more todowith so

lamentation brought theBrethren tothespot toknow what ailed them. And
theagedmen toldhow their kind benefactress was dead, andthattheywept
because theyhad lostherandshould never seeherlikeagain. Shocked atsuch
impropriety, theBrethren talked together intheHall ofTruth about thecause
oftheoldmen's sorrow, andthey toldtheMaster too,onhisentering theHall
andasking what theywere discussing. "Ah, Brethren," said he,"intimes past,

"Wife," said he,"the king's conservatories arelikeapoolhaunted

"Butwhen it'snight-time anddark," said she, "what's tostopaman's

''Once bitten, tioice shy."—This storywastoldbytheMaster when atJetavana,
about subduing desires.
Wearetoldthatsome fivehundred rich friends, sons ofmerchants ofSavatthi,
wei-e ledbylistening totheMaster's teachings togive their hearts totheTruth,
andthatjoining theBrotherhood they lived inJetavana inthepartthatAnatha-
piiidika paved with gold pieces laidsidebyside^
Now inthemiddle ofacertain night thoughts oflusttookhold ofthem, and,
intheir distress, they setthemselves tolayholdonceagain oftheluststheyhad
renounced. Inthathour theMaster raised aloft thelamp ofhisomniscience to
discover whatmanner ofpassion hadhold oftheBrethren inJetavana, and,
reading their hearts, perceived that lustanddesire hadsprung upwithin them.
Like asamother watches overheronly child, orasaone-eyed man iscareful of
theoneeyelefthim,even sowatchful istheMaster over hisdisciples;—atmorn
oreven, atwhatsoever hour their passions waragainst them, hewillnot lethis
faithful beoverpowered butinthatself-same hoursubdues theraging lusts that
beset them. Wherefore thethought came tohim, "This islikeaswhen thieves
break intothecityofanemperor ;Iwillunfold theTruth straightway tothese
Brethren, totheendthat,subduing their lusts, Imay raisethem toArahatship."
Sohecame forth from hisperfumed chamber, andinsweet tones called by
name forthevenerable Elder, Ananda, Treasiu-er oftheFaith. And theElder
cameandwithdueobeisance stood before theMaster toknow hispleasure. Then
theMaster badehimassemble together inhisperfumed chamber alltheBrethren
whodwelt inthatquarter ofJetavana. Tradition saysthattheMaster's thought
wasthat ifhesummoned onlythose fivehundred Brethren, theywould conclude
thathewasaware oftheir lustful mood, andwould bedebarred bytheir agitation
from receiving theTruth ;accordingly hesummoned alltheBrethren whodwelt
there. And theElder took akeyandwent from celltocellsummoning the
Brethren tillallwereassembled intheperfumed chamber. Then hemade ready
theBuddha-seat. Instately dignity likeMount Sineru resting onthesolid earth,
theMaster seated himself ontheBuddha-seat, making aglory shine round himof
paired garlands upon garlands ofsix-coloured light, which divided anddivided
intomasses ofthesizeofaplatter, ofthesizeofacanopy, andofthesizeofa
tower, until, likeshafts oflightning, theraysreached totheheavens above. It
waseven aswhen thesun rises, stirring theocean tothedepths.
With reverent obeisance andreverent hearts, theBrethren entered andtook
their seats around him,encompassing himasitwere within anorange curtain.
Then intones asofMaha-Brahma theMaster [502] said, "Brethren, aBrother

itbeimagined thatwicked desires areatrivial matter. Forsuch desires are

Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasre-born into lifeasajackal anddwelt intheforest bythe
river-side. Nowanoldelephant diedbythebanks oftheGanges, andthe
jackal, finding thecarcass, congratulated himself onlighting upon such a
store ofmeat. Firsthebitthetrunk, butthatwas likebiting aplough-
handle. "There's noeating here," saidthejackal andtook abite ata
tusk. Butthatwaslikebiting bones. Then hetriedanear,butthatwas
likechewing therimofawinnowing-basket. Sohefelltoonthestomach,
butfound itastough asagrain-basket. Thefeetwerenobetter, forthey
were likeamortar. Next hetried the tail,butthatwaslikethepestle.
"That won't doeither," said thejackal; andhaving failed elsewhere to
findatoothsome part,hetried therearandfound that likeeating asoft

right intothebelly, where hemade aplenteous meal offthekidneys, heart
andtherest,quenching histhirst with theblood. Andwhen night came
on,helaydown inside. Ashelaythere, thethought came into the
jackal's mind, "This carcass isbothmeat andhouse tome,andwherefore
should Ileave itl" Sothere hestopped, anddwelt intheelephant's
inwards, eating away. Time wore on tillthesummer sunand the
summer winds dried andshrank theelephant's hide, [503] until the
entrance bywhich thejackal hadgotinwasclosed andtheinterior wasin
utter darkness. Thus thejackal was, asitwere, cutofffrom theworld
andconfined intheinterspace between theworlds. After thehide, the
flesh driedupandtheblood wasexhausted. Inafrenzy ofdespair, he
rushed toandfrobeating against hisprison walls inthefruitless endeavour
toescape. Bu.t ashebobbed upanddown inside likeaball ofriceina
boiling saucepan, soon atempest broke andthedownpour moistened the
shell ofthecarcass andrestored ittoitsformer state, tilllight shone like
astarthrough thewaybywhich thejackal hadgotin."Saved !saved!"
cried thejackal, and,backing intotheelephant's headmade arush head-first
attheoutlet. Hemanaged togetthrough, itistrue,butonlybyleaving
allhishairontheway.And firstheran,then hehalted, andthen sat
down andsurveyed hishairless body,nowsmooth asapalm-stem. "Ah!"

stanza:—
Once bitten, twice shy. Ah, gi'eat wasmyfear!
Ofelephants' inwards henceforth I'llsteer clear.
Andwith these words thejackal made off,nordidheever again so
much aslook either atthat oratanyother elephant's carcass. And
thenceforth liewasnever greedy again.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "Brethren, never letdesires take root in
theheart butpluckthem outwheresoever theyspring up." [504] Having preached

three gates with watch-towers. Inthat citythere were always seven thousand
seven hundred andseven kings togovern thekingdom, andalikenumber of
viceroys, generals, and treasurers. Among thekings' sonswasoneknown as

none buthecould possibly tame their son's fierce spirit. Sotheybrought him

Wherefore letallmenshew kindness andbedoers ofgood, andthen assuredly

Suchwasthepower ofthisonelecture upon theprince that hispridewas
humbled forthwith ;hisarrogance andselfishness passed fromhim,andhisheart
wasturned tokindness and love. Nevermore didherevile orstrike, butbecame
gentle asasnake withdrawn fangs, asacrabwithbroken claws, asabullwith

Marking thischange ofmood, theBrethren talked together intheHall of
Truth ofhowtheLicchavi Prince Wicked, whom theceaseless exhortations of
hisparents could notcurb, hadbeensubdued andhumbled with asingle ex-
hortation bytheAll-Wise Buddha, andhow thiswas liketaming sixrutting

And here theMaster entered theHallandquestioned them astowliat they
were discussing. Then they toldhim,andhesaid, "Brethren, this isnotthe

"Why nottakeupyourabode inmypleasaunce 1"suggested theking.
Then, having gained theBodhisatta's consent, andhaving eaten food
himself, hewent with hisguest tothepleasaunce andtherehadahermitage
built with acellfortheday,andacellforthenight. This dwelling was
provided with theeight requisites ofanascetic. Having thus installed the
Bodhisatta, thekingputhimunder thecharge ofthegardener andwent
back tothepalace. Soitcame topass that theBodhisatta dwelt thence-
forward intheking's pleasaunce, andtwice orthrice every daytheking
came tovisithim.
Now thekinghadafierce andpassionate sonwhowasknown as
Prince Wicked, whowasbeyond thecontrol ofhisfather and kinsfolk.
Councillors, brahmins and citizens allpointed outtotheyoung manthe
error ofhisways, butinvain.Hepaidnoheed totheir counsels. And
theking feltthattheonlyhope ofreclaiming hissonlaywith thevirtuous
ascetic. Soasalastchance [507] hetook theprince andhanded him
over totheBodhisatta todeal with. Then theBodhisatta^ walked with
theprince inthepleasaunce tilltheycame towhere aseedling Nimb tree
wasgrowing, onwhich asyetgrew buttwoleaves, oneonone side,oneon
theother.
"Taste aleafofthis little tree, prince," saidtheBodhisatta, "and see
what itislike."
Theyoungman didso ;butscarce hadheputtheleafinhismouth,
when hespat itoutwithanoath,andhawked andspat togetthetaste out
ofhismouth.


No. 150. 319
"What isthematter, prince?" asked theBodhisatta.
"Sir, to-day this treeonly suggests adeadly poison; but, ifleft to
grow, itwillprove thedeath ofmany persons," said theprince, and
forthwith plucked upandcrushed inhishands thetinygrowth, reciting
these lines:—
Ifpoison lurk inthebaby tree,
What willthe fullgrowth prove tobe?
Then saidtheBodhisatta tohim,"Prince, dreading what thepoisonous
seedling might grow to,youhave torn itupandrent itasunder. Even as
youacted tothetree, sothepeople ofthiskingdom, dreading what aprince
sofierce andpassionate maybecome when king, willnotplace youonthe
throne butuproot you like thisNimb treeanddrive youforth toexile.
Wherefore takewarning bythetreeandhenceforth shewmercy andabound
inloving-kindness."
From thathour theprince's mood waschanged. Hegrewhumble and
meek, merciful andoverflowing with kindness. Abiding bytheBodhisatta's
counsel, [508]when athisfather's death hecame tobeking, heabounded
incharity and other good works, and intheendpassed away tofare
accordins: tohisdeserts.
Hislesson ended, theMaster said, "So, Brethren, this isnotthe firsttime
that Ihavetamed Prince Wicked;Ididthesame indays gone by."Then
heidentified theBirth bysaying, "The Licchavi Prince Wicked ofto-day was
thePrince Wicked ofthestory, Ananda theking,and Itheascetic whoexhorted
theprince togoodness."

''Befriend avillain."—This storywastoldbytheMaster when attheBamboo-

that rancorous foeoftheBuddhas, thebaseandwicked Devadatta, and inhis
infatuation, Avishing todohonour toDevadatta, expended avastsum inerecting

andmakes theKing confess tohaving killed hisfather (Vol. i.p.85).

thegoodandvirtuous oldKing hisfather, whohadentered onthePaths, thereby
destroying hisownchance ofwinning likegoodness andvirtue, andbringing great
woeupon himself.
Hearing thattheearth hadswallowed upDevadatta, hefeared alike fate for
himself. Andsuchwasthefrenzy ofhisterror thatherecked notofhiskingdom's
welfare, slept notupon hisbed,butranged abroad quaking inevery limb, likea
young elei)hant inanagony ofpain. Infancy hesawtheearth yawning forhim,
andtheflames ofhelldarting forth ;hecould seehimself fastened down onabed
ofburning metal with ironlances being thrust into hisbody. Like awounded
cock, notforoneinstant washeatpeace. The desire came onhim tosee
theAll-Wise Buddha, tobereconciled tohim,and toaskguidance ofhim;
butbecause ofthemagnitude ofhistransgressions heshrank fromcoming into
theBuddha's presence. When theKattika festival came round, andbynight
Rajagaha wasilluminated andadorned likeacityofthegods, theKing, ashe
satonhighupon athrone ofgold, sawJivaka Komarabhacca sitting near.
Theideaflashed across hismind togowith Jivaka totheBuddha, buthefelt
hecould notsayoutright thathewould notgoalone butwanted Jivaka to
take him.No ;thebetter course would be,after praising thebeauty ofthe
night, [509] topropose sitting a1>thefeetofsome sage orbrahmin, and toask
thecourtiers what teacher cangive theheart peace. Ofcourse, theywould
severally praise theirown masters ;butJivaka would besure toextol the
All-Enlightened Buddha; and totheBuddha theKing with Jivaka wovild go.
Soheburst into fivefold praises ofthenight, saying—"How fair, sirs, isthis
clear cloudless night !How beautiful !Howcharming !How delightful !How
lovely 1!What sage orbrahmin shallweseek out,toseeifhaply hemay give
ourhearts peace?"
Then oneminister recommended Purana Kassapa, another Makkhali Gosala,
andothers again Ajita Kesakambala, Kakudha Kaccayana, Saiijaya Belatthi-
putta, orNigantha Nathaputta. Allthese names theKing heard insilence,
waiting forhischief minister, Jivaka, tospeak. But Jivaka, suspecting that
theKing's realobject wastomakehimspeak, kept silence inorder tomake sure.
AtlasttheKing said, "Well,mygood Jivaka, whyhaveyounothing tosay?"
Attheword Jivaka arose from hisseat,andwithhands clasped inadoration
towards theBlessed One, cried, "Sire,yonder inmymango-grove dwells the
All-Enlightened Buddha with thirteen hundred and fiftyBrethren. This isthe
highfame thathasarisen concerning him." And hereheproceeded torecite
thenine titles ofhonour ascribed tohim,beginning with'Venerable^.' When
hehadfurther shewn howfrom hisbirth onwards theBuddha's powers had
surpassed alltheearlier presages andexpectations, Jivaka said, "Unto him, the
Blessed One, lettheKing repair, tohear thetruth andtoputquestions."
Hisobject thus attained, theKing asked Jivaka tohave theelephants got
ready andwent inroyal state toJivaka's mango-grove, where hefound inthe
perfumed pavilion theBuddha amid theBrotherhood which wastranquil asthe
ocean inperfect repose. Look where hewould, theKing's eyesawonly the
endless ranks oftheBrethren, exceeding innumbers anyfollowing hehadever
seen. Pleased with thedemeanour oftheBrethren, theKing bowed lowand
spoke words ofpraise. Then saluting theBuddha, heseated himself, and
asked himthequestion, 'What isthe fruit ofthereligious life?' And the
Blessed Onegave utterance totheSamaiiiiaphala Sutta intwo sections^. Glad
atheart, theKingmade hispeace with theBuddha attheclose oftheSutta,
andrising updeparted withsolemn obeisance. Soon after theKing hadgone,

theMaster addressed theBrethren and said, "Brethren, thisKing isuprooted;
[510] hadnotthisKing slain inhist fordominion that righteous ruler his
father, hewould havewon theArahat's clear vision oftheTruth, ereherose
from hisseat. Butforhissinful favouring ofDevadatta hehasmissed thefruit
ofthefirstpath1."
NextdaytheBrethren talked together ofallthisandsaidthat Ajatasattu's
crime ofimrricide, which wasduetothatwicked andsinful Devadatta whom he
hadfavoured, had losthimsalvation;andthatDevadatta hadbeen theKing's
ruin. Atthispoint theMaster entered theHall ofTruth andasked thesubject
oftheir converse. Being told, theMaster said, "This isnotthe first time,
Brethren, thatAjatasattu hassuffered forfavouring thesinful;likeconduct in
thepast costhimhislife." Sosaying, hetoldthisstory ofthepast.
Once onatimewhen Brahmadatta was reigning inBenares, the
Bodhisatta wasborn into thefamily ofawealthy brahmin. Arriving at
years ofdiscretion, hewent tostudy atTakkasila, where hereceived a
complete education. InBenares asateacher heenjoyed world-wide fame
andhad fivehundred young brahmins aspupils. Among these wasone
named SaiijTva, towhom theBodhisatta taught thespell forraising the
dead tolife. Butthough theyoung manwastaught this,hewasnot
taught thecounter charm. Proud ofhisnewpower, hewent with his
fellow-pupils totheforest wood-gathei-ing, andtherecame onadead tiger,
'*Now seemebring thetiger tolifeagain," said he.
"You can't," saidthey.
"You lookandyou willseemedoit."
"Well, ifyoucan,doso,"saidtheyandclimbed upatreeforthwith.
Then SaiijTva repeated hischarm andstruck thedead tiger with a
potsherd. Upstarted thetiger andquick aslightning sprang atSanjiva
and bithimonthethi'oat, killing himoutright. Dead fellthetiger then
andthere, anddead fellSanjiva tooatthesame spot. Sothere thetwo
laydead sidebyside.
Theyoung brahmins took theirwood andwent back totheirmaster to
whom they toldthestory. "Mydear pupils," said he,"mark herein how
byreason ofshowing favour tothesinful andpaying honour where itwas
notdue,hehasbrought allthiscalamity upon himself." And sosaying he
uttered thisstanza:—
[511] Befriend avillain, aidhim inhisneed,
And, likethat tigerwhich Sanjiva^ raised
To life,hestraight devours you foryour pains.
^Unlike thepreceding sentence, this lastsentence does notoccur intheDigha
Nikaya. Theinterpolation isinteresting assuggesting thelicense withwhich words
wereputintotheMaster's mouth byBuddhist authors.
-Thegloss suggests that sanjlviko(='oforbelonging toSanjiva') isanacridpun
onthemeaning ofSanjlvo, which means 'alive,'—thetigerhaving been restored tolife
bySanjiva, whom itbereft oflifebyway ofreward.

SuchwastheBodhisatta's lesson totheyoung brahmins, and after a
lifeofalmsgiving andother gooddeeds hepassed away tofareaccording to
hisdeserts.
Hislesson ended theMaster identified theBirth bysaying, "Ajatasattu was
theyoung brahmin ofthose dayswhobrought thedead tiger tolife,and Ithe
world-famed teacher."
