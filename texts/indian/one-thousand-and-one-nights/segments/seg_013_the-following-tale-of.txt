the following tale of

End of Vol. 1.


Footnotes


[FN#1] Allaho A'alam, a deprecatory formula, used because the writer is
going to indulge in a series of what may possibly be untruths.

[FN#2] The "Sons of Sásán" are the famous Sassanides whose dynasty
ended with the Arabian Conquest (A.D. 641). "Island" Jazírah) in Arabic
also means "Peninsula," and causes much confusion in geographical
matters.

[FN#3] Shahryár not Shahriyar (Persian) = "City-friend." The Bulak
edition corrupts it to Shahrbáz (City-hawk), and the Breslau to
Shahrbán or "Defender of the City," like Marz-ban=Warden of the
Marshes. Shah Zamán (Persian)="King of the Age:" Galland prefers Shah
Zenan, or "King of women," and the Bul. edit. changes it to Shah
Rummán, "Pomegranate King." Al-Ajam denotes all regions not Arab
(Gentiles opposed to Jews, Mlechchhas to Hindus, Tajiks to Turks, etc.,
etc.), and especially Persia; Ajami (a man of Ajam) being an equivalent
of the Gr. Βάρβαρος. See Vol. ii., p. 1.

[FN#4] Galland writes "Vizier," a wretched frenchification of a mincing
Turkish mispronunciation; Torrens, "Wuzeer" (Anglo-Indian and
Gilchristian); Lane, "Wezeer"; (Egyptian or rather Cairene); Payne,
"Vizier," according to his system; Burckhardt (Proverbs), "Vizír;" and
Mr. Keith-Falconer, "Vizir." The root is popularly supposed to be
"wizr" (burden) and the meaning "Minister;" Wazir al-Wuzará being
"Premier." In the Koran (chapt. xx., 30) Moses says, "Give me a Wazir
of my family, Harun (Aaron) my brother." Sale, followed by the
excellent version of the Rev. J. M. Rodwell, translates a "Counsellor,"
and explains by "One who has the chief administration of affairs under
a prince." But both learned Koranists learnt their Orientalism in
London, and, like such students generally, fail only upon the easiest
points, familiar to all old dwellers in the East.

[FN#5] This three-days term (rest-day, drest-day and departure day)
seems to be an instinct-made rule in hospitality. Among Moslems it is a
Sunnat or practice of the Prophet.)

[FN#6] _i.e._, I am sick at heart.

[FN#7] Debauched women prefer negroes on account of the size of their
parts. I measured one man in Somali-land who, when quiescent, numbered
nearly six inches. This is a characteristic of the negro race and of
African animals; _e.g._ the horse; whereas the pure Arab, man and
beast, is below the average of Europe; one of the best proofs by the
by, that the Egyptian is not an Asiatic, but a negro partially
white-washed. Moreover, these imposing parts do not increase
proportionally during erection; consequently, the "deed of kind" takes
a much longer time and adds greatly to the woman's enjoyment. In my
time no honest Hindi Moslem would take his women-folk to Zanzibar on
account of the huge attractions and enormous temptations there and
thereby offered to them. Upon the subject of Imsák = retention of semen
and "prolongation of pleasure," I shall find it necessary to say more.

[FN#8] The very same words were lately spoken in England proving the
eternal truth of The Nights which the ignorant call "downright lies."

[FN#9] The Arab's _Tue la!_

[FN#10] Arab. "Sayd wa kanas": the former usually applied to fishing;
hence Sayda (Sidon) = fish-town. But noble Arabs (except the Caliph
Al-Amin) do not fish; so here it means simply "sport," chasing,
coursing, birding (oiseler), and so forth.

[FN#11] In the Mac. Edit. the negro is called "Mas'úd"; here he utters
a kind of war-cry and plays upon the name, "Sa'ád, Sa'íd, Sa'úd," and
"Mas'ud", all being derived from one root, "Sa'ad" = auspiciousness,
prosperity.

[FN#12] The Arab. singular (whence the French "génie"), fem. Jinniyah;
the Div and Rakshah of old Guebre-land and the "Rakshasa," or "Yaksha,"
of Hinduism. It would be interesting to trace the evident connection,
by no means "accidental," of "Jinn" with the "Genius" who came to the
Romans through the Asiatic Etruscans, and whose name I cannot derive
from "gignomai" or "genitus." He was unknown to the Greeks, who had the
Daimon {Greek Letters}, a family which separated, like the Jinn and the
Genius, into two categories, the good (Agatho-dæmons) and the bad
(Kako-dæmons). We know nothing concerning the status of the Jinn
amongst the pre-Moslemitic or pagan Arabs: the Moslems made him a
supernatural anthropoid being, created of subtile fire (Koran chapts.
xv. 27; lv. 14), not of earth like man, propagating his kind, ruled by
mighty kings, the last being Ján bin Ján, missionarised by Prophets and
subject to death and Judgment. From the same root are "Junún" = madness
(_i.e._, possession or obsession by the Jinn) and "Majnún"=a madman.
According to R. Jeremiah bin Eliazar in Psalm xii. 5, Adam was
excommunicated for one hundred and thirty years, during which he begat
children in his own image (Gen. v. 3) and these were Mazikeen or
Shedeem—Jinns. Further details anent the Jinn will presently occur.

[FN#13] Arab. "Amsár" (cities): in Bul. Edit. "Amtár" (rains), as in
Mac. Edit. So Mr. Payne (I., 5) translates: And when she flashes forth
the lightning of her glance, She maketh eyes to rain, like showers,
with many a tear. I would render it, "She makes whole cities shed
tears," and prefer it for a reason which will generally influence
me—its superior exaggeration and impossibility.

[FN#14] Not "A-frit," pronounced Aye-frit, as our poets have it. This
variety of the Jinn, who, as will be shown, are divided into two races
like mankind, is generally, but not always, a malignant being, hostile
and injurious to mankind (Koran xxvii. 39).

[FN#15] _i.e._, "I conjure thee by Allah;" the formula is technically
called "Inshád."

[FN#16] This introducing the name of Allah into an indecent tale is
essentially Egyptian and Cairene. But see Boccaccio ii. 6, and vii. 9.

[FN#17] So in the Mac. Edit.; in others "ninety." I prefer the greater
number as exaggeration is a part of the humour. In the Hindu "Kathá
Sárit Ságara" (Sea of the Streams of Story), the rings are one hundred
and the catastrophe is more moral, the good youth Yashodhara rejects
the wicked one's advances; she awakes the water-sprite, who is about to
slay him, but the rings are brought as testimony and the improper young
person's nose is duly cut off. (Chap. Ixiii.; p. 80, of the excellent
translation by Prof. C. H. Tawney: for the Bibliotheca Indica:
Calcutta, 1881.) The Kathá, etc., by Somadeva (century xi), is a
poetical version of the prose compendium, the "Vrihat Kathá" (Great
Story) by Gunadhya (cent. vi).

[FN#18] The Joseph of the Koran, very different from him of Genesis. We
shall meet him often enough in The Nights.

[FN#19] "Iblis," vulgarly written "Eblis," from a root meaning The
Despairer, with a suspicious likeness to Diabolos; possibly from
"Balas," a profligate. Some translate it The Calumniator, as Satan is
the Hater. Iblis (who appears in the Arab. version of the N. Testament)
succeeded another revolting angel Al-Haris; and his story of pride
refusing to worship Adam, is told four times in the Koran from the
Talmud (Sanhedrim 29). He caused Adam and Eve to lose Paradise (ii.
34); he still betrays mankind (xxv. 31), and at the end of time he,
with the other devils, will be "gathered together on their knees round
Hell" (xix. 69). He has evidently had the worst of the game, and we
wonder, with Origen, Tillotson, Burns and many others, that he does not
throw up the cards.

[FN#20] A similar tale is still told at Akká (St. John d'Acre)
concerning the terrible "butcher"—Jazzár (Djezzar) Pasha. One can
hardly pity women who are fools enough to run such risks. According to
Frizzi, Niccolò, Marquis of Este, after beheading Parisina, ordered all
the faithless wives of Ferrara to be treated in like manner.

[FN#21] "Shahrázád" (Persian) = City-freer, in the older version
Scheherazade (probably both from Shirzád=lion-born).
"Dunyázád"=World-freer. The Bres. Edit. corrupts theformer to Sháhrzád
or Sháhrazád, and the Mac. and Calc. to Shahrzád or Shehrzád. I have
ventured to restore the name as it should be. Galland for the second
prefers Dinarzade (?) and Richardson Dinazade (Dinázád =
Religion-freer): here I have followed Lane and Payne; though in "First
Footsteps" I was misled by Galland. See Vol. ii. p. 1.

[FN#22] Probably she proposed to "Judith" the King. These learned and
clever young ladies are very dangerous in the East.

[FN#23] In Egypt, etc., the bull takes the place of the Western ox. The
Arab. word is "Taur" (Thaur, Saur); in old Persian "Tora" and Lat.
"Taurus," a venerable remnant of the days before the "Semitic" and
"Aryan" families of speech had split into two distinct growths. "Taur"
ends in the Saxon "Steor" and the English "Steer "

[FN#24] Arab. "Abú Yakzán" = the Wakener, because the ass brays at
dawn.

[FN#25] Arab. "Tibn"; straw crushed under the sledge: the hay of Egypt,
Arabia, Syria, etc. The old country custom is to pull up the corn by
handfuls from the roots, leaving the land perfectly bare: hence the
"plucking up" of Hebrew Holy Writ. The object is to preserve every atom
of "Tibn."

[FN#26] Arab. "Yá Aftah": Al-Aftah is an epithet of the bull, also of
the chameleon.

[FN#27] Arab. "Balíd," a favourite Egyptianism often pleasantly
confounded with "Wali" (a Santon), hence the latter comes to mean "an
innocent," a "ninny."

[FN#28] From the Calc. Edit., Vol. 1., p. 29.

[FN#29] Arab. "Abu Yakzán" is hardly equivalent with "Père l'Eveillé."

[FN#30] In Arab. the wa (x) is the sign of parenthesis.

[FN#31] In the nearer East the light little plough is carried afield by
the bull or ass.

[FN#32] Ocymum basilicum, the "royal herb," so much prized all over the
East, especially in India, where, under the name of "Tulsi," it is a
shrub sacred to the merry god Krishna. I found the verses in a MS. copy
of The Nights.

[FN#33] Arab. "Sadaf," the Kauri, or cowrie, brought from the Maldive
and Lakdive Archipelago. The Kámús describes this "Wada'" or Concha
Veneris as "a white shell (whence to "shell out") which is taken out of
the sea, the fissure of which is white like that of the date-stone. It
is hung about the neck to avert the evil eye." The pearl in Arab. is
"Murwarid," hence evidently "Margarita" and Margaris (woman's name).

[FN#34] Arab. "Kat'a" (bit of leather): some read "Nat'a;" a leather
used by way of table-cloth, and forming a bag for victuals; but it is
never made of bull's hide.

[FN#35] The older "Cadi," a judge in religious matters. The Shuhúd, or
Assessors, are officers of the Mahkamah or Kazi's Court.

[FN#36] Of which more in a future page. He thus purified himself
ceremonially before death.

[FN#37] This is Christian rather than Moslem: a favourite Maltese curse
is "Yahrak Kiddisak man rabba-k!" = burn the Saint who brought thee up!

[FN#38] A popular Egyptian phrase: the dog and the cock speak like
Fellahs.

[FN#39] i. e. between the last sleep and dawn when they would rise to
wash and pray.

[FN#40] Travellers tell of a peculiar knack of jerking the date-stone,
which makes it strike with great force: I never saw this "Inwá"
practised, but it reminds me of the water splashing with one hand in
the German baths.

[FN#41] i.e., sorely against his will.

[FN#42] Arab. "Shaykh"=an old man (primarily), an elder, a chief (of
the tribe, guild, etc.), and honourably addressed to any man. Comp.
among the neo Latins "Sieur," "Signore," "Señor," "Senhor," etc. from
Lat. "Senior," which gave our "Sire" and "Sir." Like many in Arabic the
word has a host of different meanings and most of them will occur in
the course of The Nights. Ibrahim (Abraham) was the first Shaykh or man
who became grey. Seeing his hairs whiten he cried, "O Allah what is
this?" and the answer came that it was a sign of dignified gravity.
Hereupon he exclaimed, "O Lord increase this to me!" and so it happened
till his locks waxed snowy white at the age of one hundred and fifty.
He was the first who parted his hair, trimmed his mustachios, cleaned
his teeth with the Miswák (tooth-stick), pared his nails, shaved his
pecten, snuffed up water, used ablution after stool and wore a shirt
(Tabari).

[FN#43] The word is mostly plural = Jinnís: it is also singular = a
demon; and Ján bin Ján has been noticed.

[FN#44] With us moderns "liver" suggests nothing but malady: in Arabic
and Persian as in the classic literature of Europe it is the seat of
passion, the heart being that of affection. Of this more presently.

[FN#45] Originally in Al-Islam the concubine (Surriyat, etc.) was a
captive taken in war and the Koran says nothing about buying
slave-girls. But if the captives were true believers the Moslem was
ordered to marry not to keep them. In modern days concubinage has
become an extensive subject. Practically the disadvantage is that the
slave-girls, knowing themselves to be the master's property, consider
him bound to sleep with them; which is by no means the mistress's view.
Some wives, however, when old and childless, insist, after the fashion
of Sarah, upon the husband taking a young concubine and treating her
like a daughter—which is rare. The Nights abound in tales of
concubines, but these are chiefly owned by the Caliphs and high
officials who did much as they pleased. The only redeeming point in the
system is that it obviated the necessity of prostitution which is,
perhaps, the greatest evil known to modern society.

[FN#46] Arab. "Al-Kahánah"=the craft of a "Káhin" (Heb. Cohen) a
diviner, soothsayer, etc.

[FN#47] Arab. "Id al-kabír = The Great Festival; the Turkish Bayrám and
Indian Bakar-eed (Kine-fête), the pilgrimage-time, also termed
"Festival of the Kurbán" (sacrifice) because victims are slain, Al-Zuha
(of Undurn or forenoon), Al-Azhá (of serene night) and Al-Nahr (of
throat-cutting). For full details I must refer readers to my "Personal
Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah" (3 vols. 8vo,
London, Longmans, 1855). I shall have often to refer to it.

[FN#48] Arab. "Kalám al-mubáh," i.e., that allowed or permitted to her
by the King, her husband.

[FN#49] Moslem Kings are expected, like the old Gabble Monarchs, to
hold "Darbar" (i.e., give public audience) at least twice a day,
morning and evening. Neglect of this practice caused the ruin of the
Caliphate and of the Persian and Moghul Empires: the great lords were
left uncontrolled and the lieges revolted to obtain justice. The Guebre
Kings had two levée places, the Rozistan (day station) and the
Shabistan (night-station—istán or stán being a nominal form of istádan,
to stand, as Hindo-stán). Moreover one day in the week the sovereign
acted as "Mufti" or Supreme Judge.

[FN#50] Arab. "Al-Bashárah," the gift everywhere claimed in the East
and in Boccaccio's Italy by one who brings good news. Those who do the
reverse expose themselves to a sound strappado.

[FN#51] A euphemistic formula, to avoid mentioning unpleasant matters.
I shall note these for the benefit of students who would honestly
prepare for the public service in Moslem lands.

[FN#52] Arab. "Dínár," from the Latin denarius (a silver coin worth ten
ounces of brass) through the Greek δηνάριον: it is a Koranic word
(chapt. iii.) though its Arab equivalent is "Miskál." It also occurs in
the Kathá before quoted, clearly showing the derivation. In the "Book
of Kalilah and Dimnah" it is represented by the Daric or Persian Dinár,
δαρεικός, from Dárá= a King (whence Darius). The Dinar, sequin or
ducat, contained at different times from 10 and 12 (Abu Hanifah's day)
to 20 and even 25 dirhams or drachmas, and, as a weight, represented a
drachma and a half. Its value greatly varied, but we may assume it here
at nine shillings or ten francs to half a sovereign. For an elaborate
article on the Dinar see Yule's "Cathay and the Way Thither" (ii., pp.
439-443).

[FN#53] The formula used in refusing alms to an "asker" or in rejecting
an insufficient offer: "Allah will open to thee!" (some door of
gain—not mine)! Another favourite ejaculation is "Allah Karim" (which
Turks pronounce "Kyereem") = Allah is All-beneficent! meaning Ask Him,
not me.

[FN#54] The public bath. London knows the word through "The Hummums."

[FN#55] Arab. "Dirham" (Plur. diráhim, also used in the sense of money,
"siller"),the Gr. δραχμή and the drachuma of Plautus (Trin. 2, 4, 23).
The word occurs in the Panchatantra also showing the derivation; and in
the Syriac Kalilah wa Dimnah it is "Zúz." This silver piece was = 6
obols (9 3/4d.) and as a weight = 66 1/2 grains. The Dirham of The
Nights was worth six "Dánik," each of these being a fraction over a
penny. The modern Greek Drachma is=one franc.

[FN#56] In Arabic the speaker always puts himself first, even if he
address the King, without intending incivility.

[FN#57] A she-Ifrit, not necessarily an evil spirit.

[FN#58] Arab. "Kullah" (in Egypt pron. "gulleh"), the wide mouthed jug,
called in the Hijaz "baradiyah;" "daurak" being the narrow. They are
used either for water or sherbet and, being made of porous clay,
"sweat," and keep the contents cool; hence all old Anglo Egyptians
drink from them, not from bottles. Sometimes they are perfumed with
smoke of incense, mastich or Kafal (Amyris Kafal). For their graceful
shapes see Lane's "Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern
Egyptians" (chapt. v) I quote, here and elsewhere, from the fifth
edition, London, Murray, 1860.

[FN#59] "And what is?" etc. A popular way of expressing great
difference. So in India:—"Where is Rajah Bhoj (the great King) and
where is Gangá the oilman?"

[FN#60] Here, as in other places, I have not preserved the monorhyme,
but have ended like the English sonnet with a couplet; as a rule the
last two lines contain a "Husn makta'" or climax.

[FN#61] Lit. "he began to say (or speak) poetry," such improvising
being still common amongst the Badawin as I shall afterwards note. And
although Mohammed severely censured profane poets, who "rove as bereft
of their senses through every valley" and were directly inspired by
devils (Koran xxvi.), it is not a little curious to note that he
himself spoke in "Rajaz" (which see) and that the four first Caliphs
all "spoke poetry." In early ages the verse would not be written, if
written at all, till after the maker's death. I translate "inshád" by
"versifying" or "repeating" or "reciting," leaving it doubtful if the
composition be or be not original. In places, however, it is clearly
improvised and then as a rule it is model doggrel.

[FN#62] Arab. "Allahumma"=Yá Allah (O Allah) but with emphasis the Fath
being a substitute for the voc. part. Some connect it with the Heb.
"Alihím," but that fancy is not Arab. In Al-Hariri and the rhetoricians
it sometimes means to be sure; of course; unless indeed; unless
possibly= Greek νὴ δία.

[FN#63] Probably in consequence of a vow. These superstitious
practices, which have many a parallel amongst ourselves, are not
confined to the lower orders in the East.

[FN#64] i.e., saying "Bismillah!" the pious ejaculation which should
precede every act. In Boccaccio (viii., 9) it is "remembering Iddio e'
Santi."

[FN#65] Arab. Nahás asfar = brass, opposed to "Nahás" and "Nahás
ahmar," = copper.

[FN#66] This alludes to the legend of Sakhr al-Jinni, a famous fiend
cast by Solomon David son into Lake Tiberias whose storms make it a
suitable place. Hence the "Bottle imp," a world-wide fiction of
folk-lore: we shall find it in the "Book of Sindibad," and I need
hardly remind the reader of Le Sage's "Diable Boiteux," borrowed from
"El Diablo Cojuelo," the Spanish novel by Luiz Velez de Guevara.

[FN#67] Márid (lit. "contumacious" from the Heb. root Marad to rebel,
whence "Nimrod" in late Semitic) is one of the tribes of the Jinn,
generally but not always hostile to man. His female is "Máridah."

[FN#68] As Solomon began to reign (according to vulgar chronometry) in
B.C. 1015, the text would place the tale circ. A.D. 785, = A.H. 169.
But we can lay no stress on this date which may be merely fanciful.
Professor Tawney very justly compares this Moslem Solomon with the
Hindu King, Vikramáditya, who ruled over the seven divisions of the
world and who had as many devils to serve him as he wanted.

[FN#69] Arab. "Yá Ba'íd:" a euphemism here adopted to prevent using
grossly abusive language. Others will occur in the course of these
pages.

[FN#70] i. e. about to fly out; "My heart is in my mouth." The
Fisherman speaks with the dry humour of a Fellah.

[FN#71] "Sulayman," when going out to ease himself, entrusted his
seal-ring upon which his kingdom depended to a concubine "Amínah" (the
"Faithful"), when Sakhr, transformed to the King's likeness, came in
and took it. The prophet was reduced to beggary, but after forty days
the demon fled throwing into the sea the ring which was swallowed by a
fish and eventually returned to Sulayman. This Talmudic fable is hinted
at in the Koran (chapt. xxxviii.), and commentators have extensively
embroidered it. Asaf, son of Barkhiya, was Wazir to Sulayman and is
supposed to be the "one with whom was the knowledge of the Scriptures"
(Koran, chapt. xxxvii.), i.e. who knew the Ineffable Name of Allah. See
the manifest descendant of the Talmudic Koranic fiction in the "Tale of
the Emperor Jovinian" (No. lix.) of the Gesta Romanorum, the most
popular book of mediæval Europe composed in England (or Germany) about
the end of the thirteenth century.

[FN#72] Arab. "Kumkum," a gourd-shaped bottle of metal, china or glass,
still used for sprinkling scents. Lane gives an illustration (chapt.
viii., Mod. Egypt.).

[FN#73] Arab. meaning "the Mother of Amir," a nickname for the hyena,
which bites the hand that feeds it.

[FN#74] The intellect of man is stronger than that of the Jinni; the
Ifrit, however, enters the jar because he has been adjured by the Most
Great Name and not from mere stupidity. The seal-ring of Solomon
according to the Rabbis contained a chased stone which told him
everything he wanted to know.

[FN#75] The Mesmerist will notice this shudder which is familiar to him
as preceding the "magnetic" trance.

[FN#76] Arab. "Bahr" which means a sea, a large river, a sheet of
water, etc., lit. water cut or trenched in the earth. Bahri in Egypt
means Northern; so Yamm (Sea, Mediterranean) in Hebrew is West.

[FN#77] In the Bul. Edit. "Ruyán," evidently a clerical error. The name
is fanciful not significant.

[FN#78] The geography is ultra-Shakespearean. "Fárs" (whence "Persia")
is the central Province of the grand old Empire now a mere wreck, "Rúm"
(which I write Roum, in order to avoid Jamaica) is the neo-Roman or
Byzantine Empire, while "Yunan" is the classical Arab term for Greece
(Ionia) which unlearned Moslems believe to be now under water.

[FN#79] The Sun greets Mohammed every morning even as it dances on
Easter Day for Christendom. Risum teneatis?

[FN#80] Arab. "Nadím," a term often occurring. It denotes one who was
intimate enough to drink with the Caliph, a very high honour and a
dangerous. The last who sat with "Nudamá" was Al-Razi bi'llah A.H. 329
= 940. See Al-Siyuti's famous "History of the Caliphs" translated and
admirably annotated by Major H. S. Jarrett, for the Bibliotheca Indica,
Calcutta, 1880.

[FN#81]Arab. Maydán (from Persian); Lane generally translates it "horse
course ' and Payne "tilting yard." It is both and something more; an
open space, in or near the city, used for reviewing troops, races,
playing the Jeríd (cane-spear) and other sports and exercises: thus
Al-Maydan=Gr. hippodrome. The game here alluded to is our -'polo," or
hockey on horseback, a favourite with the Persian Kings, as all old
illustrations of the Shahnamah show. Maydan is also a natural plain for
which copious Arabic has many terms, Fayhah or Sath (a plain
generally), Khabt (a low-lying plain), Bat'há (a low sandy flat),
Mahattah (a plain fit for halting) and so forth. (Pilgrimage iii., 11.)

[FN#82] For details concerning the "Ghusl" see Night xliv.

[FN#83] A popular idiom and highly expressive, contrasting the upright
bearing of the self-satisfied man with the slouch of the miserable and
the skirt-trailing of the woman in grief. I do not see the necessity of
such Latinisms as "dilated" or "expanded."

[FN#84] All these highest signs of favour foreshow, in Eastern tales
and in Eastern life, an approaching downfall of the heaviest; they are
so great that they arouse general jealousy. Many of us have seen this
at native courts.

[FN#85] This phrase is contained in the word "ihdák" =encompassing, as
the conjunctiva does the pupil.

[FN#86] I have noted this formula, which is used even in conversation
when about to relate some great unfact.

[FN#87] We are obliged to English the word by "valley," which is about
as correct as the "brook Kedron," applied to the grisliest of ravines.
The Wady (in old Coptic wah, oah, whence "Oasis") is the bed of a
watercourse which flows only after rains. I have rendered it by
"Fiumara" (Pilgrimage i., 5, and ii., 196, etc.), an Italian or rather
a Sicilian word which exactly describes the "wady."

[FN#88] I have described this scene which Mr. T. Wolf illustrated by an
excellent lithograph in "Falconry, etc." (London, Van Voorst,
MDCCCLII.)

[FN#89] Arab. "Kaylúlah," mid-day sleep; called siesta from the sixth
canonical hour.

[FN#90] This parrot-story is world-wide in folk-lore and the belief in
metempsychosis, which prevails more or less over all the East, there
lends it probability. The "Book of Sindibad" (see Night dlxxix. and
"The Academy," Sept. 20, 1884, No. 646) converts it into the "Story of
the Confectioner, his Wife and the Parrot," and it is the base of the
Hindostani text-book, "Tota-Kaháni" (Parrot-chat), an abridgement of
the Tutinámah (Parrot-book) of Nakhshabi (circ. A.D. 1300), a congener
of the Sanskrit "Suka Saptati," or Seventy Parrot-stories. The tale is
not in the Bul. or Mac. Edits. but occurs in the Bresl. (i., pp. 90,
91) much mutilated; and better in the Calc. Edit I cannot here refrain
from noticing how vilely the twelve vols. of the Breslau Edit have been
edited; even a table of contents being absent from the first four
volumes.

[FN#91] The young "Turk" is probably a late addition, as it does not
appear in many of the MSS., e. g. the Bresl. Edit. The wife usually
spreads a cloth over the cage; this in the Turkish translation becomes
a piece of leather.

[FN#92] The Hebrew-Syrian month July used to express the height of
summer. As Herodotus tells us (ii. 4) the Egyptians claimed to be the
discoverers of the solar year and the portioners of its course into
twelve parts.

[FN#93] This proceeding is thoroughly characteristic of the servile
class; they conscientiously conceal everything from the master till he
finds a clew; after which they tell him everything and something more.

[FN#94] Until late years, merchants and shopkeepers in the nearer East
all carried swords, and held it a disgrace to leave the house unarmed.

[FN#95] The Bresl. Edit. absurdly has Jazírah (an island).

[FN#96] The Ghúlah (fem. of Ghúl) is the Heb. Lilith or Lilis; the
classical Lamia; the Hindu Yogini and Dákini; the Chaldean Utug and
Gigim (desert-demons) as opposed to the Mas (hill-demon) and Telal (who
steal into towns); the Ogress of our tales and the Ba{l}a yaga {Баба
Яга} (Granny-witch) of Russian folk-lore. Etymologically "Ghul" is a
calamity, a panic fear; and the monster is evidently the embodied
horror of the grave and the graveyard.

[FN#97] Arab. "Shább" (Lat. juvenis) between puberty and forty or
according to some fifty; when the patient becomes a "Rajul ikhtiyár"
(man of free will) politely termed, and then a Shaykh or Shaybah
(grey-beard, oldster).

[FN#98] Some proverbial name now forgotten. Torrens (p. 48) translates
it "the giglot" (Fortune?) but "cannot discover the drift."

[FN#99] Arab. "Ihtizáz," that natural and instinctive movement caused
by good news suddenly given, etc.

[FN#100] Arab. "Kohl," in India, Surmah, not a "collyrium," but
powdered antimony for the eyelids. That sold in the bazars is not the
real grey ore of antimony but a galena or sulphuret of lead. Its use
arose as follows. When Allah showed Himself to Moses on Sinai through
an opening the size of a needle, the Prophet fainted and the Mount took
fire: thereupon Allah said, "Henceforth shalt thou and thy seed grind
the earth of this mountain and apply it to your eyes!" The powder is
kept in an étui called Makhalah and applied with a thick blunt needle
to the inside of the eyelid, drawing it along the rim; hence etui and
probe denote the sexual rem in re and in cases of adultery the question
will be asked, "Didst thou see the needle in the Kohl-pot ?" Women
mostly use a preparation of soot or lamp-black (Hind. Kajala, Kajjal)
whose colour is easily distinguished from that of Kohl. The latter
word, with the article (Al-Kohl) is the origin of our "alcohol;" though
even M. Littré fails to show how "fine powder" became "spirits of
wine." I found this powder (wherewith Jezebel "painted" her eyes) a
great preservative from ophthalmia in desert-travelling: the use in
India was universal, but now European example is gradually abolishing
it.

[FN#101] The tale of these two women is now forgotten.

[FN#102] Arab. "Atadakhkhal." When danger threatens it is customary to
seize a man's skirt and cry "Dakhíl-ak!" ( = under thy protection).
Among noble tribes the Badawi thus invoked will defend the stranger
with his life. Foreigners have brought themselves into contempt by thus
applying to women or to mere youths.

[FN#103] The formula of quoting from the Koran.

[FN#104] Lit. "Allah not desolate me" (by thine absence). This is still
a popular phrase—Lá tawáhishná = Do not make me desolate, i.e. by
staying away too long, and friends meeting after a term of days exclaim
"Auhashtani!"=thou hast made me desolate, Je suis desole.

[FN#105] Charming simplicity of manners when the Prime Minister carries
the fish (shade of Vattel!)!) to the cookmaid. The "Gesta Romanorum" is
nowhere more naïve.

[FN#106] Arab. "Kahílat al-taraf" = lit. eyelids lined with Kohl; and
figuratively "with black lashes and languorous look." This is a phrase
which frequently occurs in The Nights and which, as will appear,
applies to the "lower animals" as well as to men. Moslems in Central
Africa apply Kohl not to the thickness of the eyelid but upon both
outer lids, fixing it with some greasy substance. The peculiar Egyptian
(and Syrian) eye with its thick fringes of jet-black lashes, looking
like lines of black drawn with soot, easily suggests the simile. In
England I have seen the same appearance amongst miners fresh from the
colliery.

[FN#107] Of course applying to her own case.

[FN#108] Prehistoric Arabs who measured from 60 to 100 cubits high:
Koran, chapt. xxvi., etc. They will often be mentioned in The Nights.

[FN#109] I Arab. "Dastúr" (from Persian) = leave, permission. The word
has two meanings (see Burckhardt, Arab. Prov. No. 609) and is much
used, ea. before walking up stairs or entering a room where strange
women might be met. So "Tarík" = Clear the way (Pilgrimage, iii., 319).
The old Persian occupation of Egypt, not to speak of the Persian
speaking Circassians and other rulers has left many such traces in
popular language. One of them is that horror of travelers—"Bakhshísh"
pron. bakh-sheesh and shortened to shísh from the Pers. "bakhshish."
Our "Christmas box" has been most unnecessarily derived from the same,
despite our reading:—

Gladly the boy, with Christmas box in hand.

And, as will be seen, Persians have bequeathed to the outer world worse
things than bad language, e.g. heresy and sodomy.

[FN#110] He speaks of his wife but euphemistically in the masculine.

[FN#111] A popular saying throughout Al-Islam.

[FN#112] Arab. "Fata": lit.=a youth; a generous man, one of noble mind
(as youth-tide should be). It corresponds with the Lat. "vir," and has
much the meaning of the Ital. "Giovane," the Germ. "Junker" and our
"gentleman."

[FN#113] From the Bul. Edit.

[FN#114] The vagueness of his statement is euphemistic.

[FN#115] This readiness of shedding tears contrasts strongly with the
external stoicism of modern civilization; but it is true to Arab
character, and Easterns, like the heroes of Homer and Italians of
Boccacio, are not ashamed of what we look upon as the result of
feminine hysteria—"a good cry."

[FN#116] The formula (constantly used by Moslems) here denotes
displeasure, doubt how to act and so forth. Pronounce, "Lá haula wa lá
kuwwata illá bi 'lláhi 'I-Aliyyi 'I-Azim." As a rule mistakes are
marvellous: Mandeville (chapt. xii.) for "Lá iláha illa 'lláhu wa
Muhammadun Rasúlu 'llah" writes "La ellec sila, Machomete rores alla."
The former (lá haula, etc.), on account of the four peculiar Arabic
letters, is everywhere pronounced differently. and the exclamation is
called "Haulak" or "Haukal."

[FN#117] An Arab holds that he has a right to marry his first cousin,
the daughter of his father's brother, and if any win her from him a
death and a blood-feud may result. It was the same in a modified form
amongst the Jews and in both races the consanguineous marriage was not
attended by the evil results (idiotcy, congenital deafness, etc.)
observed in mixed races like the English and the Anglo-American. When a
Badawi speaks of "the daughter of my uncle" he means wife; and the
former is the dearer title, as a wife can be divorced, but blood is
thicker than water.

[FN#118] Arab. "Kahbah;" the coarsest possible term. Hence the unhappy
"Cava" of Don Roderick the Goth, which simply means The Whore.

[FN#119] The Arab "Banj" and Hindú "Bhang" (which I use as most
familiar) both derive from the old Coptic "Nibanj" meaning a
preparation of hemp (Cannabis sativa seu Indica); and here it is easy
to recognise the Homeric "Nepenthe." Al-Kazwini explains the term by
"garden hemp (Kinnab bostáni or Sháhdánaj). On the other hand not a few
apply the word to the henbane (hyoscyamus niger) so much used in
mediæval Europe. The Kámús evidently means henbane distinguishing it
from Hashish al haráfísh" = rascals' grass, i.e. the herb
Pantagruelion. The "Alfáz Adwiya" (French translation) explains
"Tabannuj" by "Endormir quelqu'un en lui faisant avaler de la
jusquiame." In modern parlance Tabannuj is = our anæsthetic
administered before an operation, a deadener of pain like myrrh and a
number of other drugs. For this purpose hemp is always used (at least I
never heard of henbane); and various preparations of the drug are sold
at an especial bazar in Cairo. See the "powder of marvellous virtue" in
Boccaccio, iii., 8; and iv., 10. Of these intoxicants, properly so
termed, I shall have something to say in a future page.

The use of Bhang doubtless dates from the dawn of civilisation, whose
earliest social pleasures would be inebriants. Herodotus (iv. c. 75)
shows the Scythians burning the seeds (leaves and capsules) in worship
and becoming drunken with the fumes, as do the S. African Bushmen of
the present day. This would be the earliest form of smoking: it is
still doubtful whether the pipe was used or not. Galen also mentions
intoxication by hemp. Amongst Moslems, the Persians adopted the drink
as an ecstatic, and about our thirteenth century Egypt, which began the
practice, introduced a number of preparations to be noticed in the
course of The Nights.

[FN#120] The rubbish heaps which outlie Eastern cities, some (near
Cairo) are over a hundred feet high.

[FN#121] Arab. "Kurrat al-ayn;" coolness of eyes as opposed to a hot
eye ("sakhin") one red with tears. The term is true and picturesque so
I translate it literally. All coolness is pleasant to dwellers in
burning lands: thus in Al-Hariri Abu Zayd says of Bassorah, "I found
there whatever could fill the eye with coolness." And a "cool booty"
(or prize) is one which has been secured without plunging into the
flames of war, or simply a pleasant prize.

[FN#122] Popularly rendered Caucasus (see Night cdxcvi): it corresponds
so far with the Hindu "Udaya" that the sun rises behind it; and the
"false dawn" is caused by a hole or gap. It is also the Persian Alborz,
the Indian Meru (Sumeru), the Greek Olympus and the Rhiphæan Range
(Veliki Camenypoys) or great starry girdle of the world, etc.

[FN#123] Arab. "Mizr" or "Mizar;" vulg. Búzah; hence the medical Lat.
Buza, the Russian Buza (millet beer), our booze, the O. Dutch "buyzen"
and the German "busen." This is the old of negro and negroid Africa,
the beer of Osiris, of which dried remains have been found in jars
amongst Egyptian tombs. In Equatorial Africa it known as Pombe; on the
Upper Nile "Merissa" or "Mirisi" and amongst the Kafirs (Caffers)
"Tshuala," "Oala" or "Boyala:" I have also heard of "Buswa"in Central
Africa which may be the origin of "Buzah." In the West it became,
(Romaic ), Xythum and cerevisia or cervisia, the humor ex hordeo, long
before the days of King Gambrinus. Central Africans drink it in immense
quantities: in Unyamwezi the standing bedsteads, covered with
bark-slabs, are all made sloping so as to drain off the liquor. A chief
lives wholly on beef and Pombe which is thick as gruel below. Hops are
unknown: the grain, mostly Holcus, is made to germinate, then pounded,
boiled and left to ferment. In Egypt the drink is affected chiefly by
Berbers, Nubians and slaves from the Upper Nile, but it is a superior
article and more like that of Europe than the "Pombe." I have given an
account of the manufacture in The Lake Regions of Central Africa, vol.
ii., p. 286. There are other preparations, Umm-bulbul (mother
nightingale), Dinzáyah and Súbiyah, for which I must refer to the
Shaykh El-Tounsy.

[FN#124] There is a terrible truth in this satire, which reminds us of
the noble dame who preferred to her handsome husband the palefrenier
laid, ord et infâme of Queen Margaret of Navarre (Heptameron No. xx.).
We have all known women who sacrificed everything despite themselves,
as it were, for the most worthless of men. The world stares and scoffs
and blames and understands nothing. There is for every woman one man
and one only in whose slavery she is "ready to sweep the floor." Fate
is mostly opposed to her meeting him but, when she does, adieu husband
and children, honour and religion, life and "soul." Moreover Nature
(human) commands the union of contrasts, such as fair and foul, dark
and light, tall and short; otherwise mankind would be like the canines,
a race of extremes, dwarf as toy-terriers, giants like mastiffs, bald
as Chinese "remedy dogs," or hairy as Newfoundlands. The famous Wilkes
said only a half truth when he backed himself, with an hour s start,
against the handsomest man in England; his uncommon and remarkable
ugliness (he was, as the Italians say, un bel brutto) was the highest
recommendation in the eyes of very beautiful women.

[FN#125] Every Moslem burial-ground has a place of the kind where
honourable women may sit and weep unseen by the multitude. These visits
are enjoined by the Apostle:—Frequent the cemetery, 'twill make you
think of futurity! Also:—Whoever visiteth the graves of his parents (or
one of them) every Friday, he shall be written a pious son, even though
he might have been in the world, before that, a disobedient.
(Pilgrimage, ii., 71.) The buildings resemble our European "mortuary
chapels." Said, Pasha of Egypt, was kind enough to erect one on the
island off Suez, for the "use of English ladies who would like shelter
whilst weeping and wailing for their dead." But I never heard that any
of the ladies went there.

[FN#126] Arab. "Ajal"=the period of life, the appointed time of death:
the word is of constant recurrence and is also applied to sudden death.
See Lane's Dictionary, s.v.

[FN#127] "The dying Badawi to his tribe" (and lover) appears to me
highly pathetic. The wild people love to be buried upon hill slopes
whence they can look down upon the camp; and they still call out the
names of kinsmen and friends as they pass by the grave-yards. A similar
piece occurs in Wetzstein (p. 27, "Reisebericht ueber Hauran," etc.):—

     O bear with you my bones where the camel bears his load
       And bury me before you, if buried I must be;
     And let me not be burled 'neath the burden of the vine
       But high upon the hill whence your sight I ever see!
     As you pass along my grave cry aloud and name your names
       The crying of your names shall revive the bones of me:
     I have fasted through my life with my friends, and in my
       death, I will feast when we meet, on that day of joy and
       glee.

[FN#128] The Akásirah (plur. of Kasrá=Chosroës) is here a title of the
four great dynasties of Persian Kings. 1. The Peshdadian or Assyrian
race, proto-historics for whom dates fail, 2. The Káyánián (Medes and
Persians) who ended with the Alexandrian invasion in B. C. 331. 3. The
Ashkánián (Parthenians or Arsacides) who ruled till A. D. 202; and 4.
The Sassanides which have already been mentioned. But strictly speaking
"Kisri" and "Kasra" are titles applied only to the latter dynasty and
especially to the great King Anushirwan. They must not be confounded
with "Khusrau" (P. N. Cyrus, Ahasuerus? Chosroës?), and yet the three
seem to have combined in "Cæsar," Kaysar and Czar. For details
especially connected with Zoroaster see vol. I, p. 380 of the Dabistan
or School of Manners, translated by David Shea and Anthony Troyer,
Paris, 1843. The book is most valuable, but the proper names are so
carelessly and incorrectly printed that the student is led into
perpetual error.

[FN#129] The words are the very lowest and coarsest; but the scene is
true to Arab life.

[FN#130] Arab."Hayhát:" the word, written in a variety of ways is
onomatopoetic, like our "heigh-ho!" it sometimes means "far from me (or
you) be it!" but in popular usage it is simply "Alas."

[FN#131] Lane (i., 134) finds a date for the book in this passage. The
Soldan of Egypt, Mohammed ibn Kala'ún, in the early eighth century
(Hijrah = our fourteenth), issued a sumptuary law compelling Christians
and Jews to wear indigo-blue and saffron-yellow turbans, the white
being reserved for Moslems. But the custom was much older and
Mandeville (chapt. ix.) describes it in A. D. 1322 when it had become
the rule. And it still endures; although abolished in the cities it is
the rule for Christians, at least in the country parts of Egypt and
Syria. I may here remark that such detached passages as these are
absolutely useless for chronology: they may be simply the additions of
editors or mere copyists.

[FN#132] The ancient "Mustaphá" = the Chosen (prophet, i. e. Mohammed),
also titled Al-Mujtaba, the Accepted (Pilgrimage, ii., 309).
"Murtaza"=the Elect, i.e. the Caliph Ali is the older "Mortada" or
"Mortadi" of Ockley and his day, meaning "one pleasing to (or
acceptable to) Allah." Still older writers corrupted it to "Mortis Ali"
and readers supposed this to be the Caliph's name.

[FN#133] The gleam (zodiacal light) preceding the true dawn; the
Persians call the former Subh-i-kázib (false or lying dawn) opposed to
Subh-i-sádik (true dawn) and suppose that it is caused by the sun
shining through a hole in the world-encircling Mount Kaf.

[FN#134] So the Heb. "Arún" = naked, means wearing the lower robe only;
= our "in his shirt."

[FN#135] Here we have the vulgar Egyptian colloquialism "Aysh" (—Ayyu
shayyin) for the classical "Má" = what.

[FN#136] "In the name of Allah!" here said before taking action.

[FN#137] Arab. "Mamlúk" (plur. Mamálik) lit. a chattel; and in The
Nights a white slave trained to arms. The "Mameluke Beys" of Egypt were
locally called the "Ghuzz," I use the convenient word in its old
popular sense;

     'Tis sung, there's a valiant Mameluke
     In foreign lands ycleped (Sir Luke)-
                      HUDIBRAS.

And hence, probably, Molière's "Mamamouchi"; and the modern French use
"Mamaluc." See Savary's Letters, No. xl.

[FN#138] The name of this celebrated successor of Nineveh, where some
suppose The Nights were written, is orig. Μεσοπύλαι (middle-gates)
because it stood on the way where four great highways meet. The Arab.
form "Mausil" (the vulgar "Mosul") is also significant, alluding to the
"junction" of Assyria and Babylonia. Hence our "muslin."

[FN#139] This is Mr. Thackeray's "nose-bag." I translate by
"walking-shoes" the Arab "Khuff" which are a manner of loose boot
covering the ankle; they are not usually embroidered, the ornament
being reserved for the inner shoe.

[FN#140] _i.e._ Syria (says Abulfeda) the "land on the left" (of one
facing the east) as opposed to Al-Yaman the "land on the right." Osmani
would mean Turkish, Ottoman. When Bernard the Wise (Bohn, p. 24) speaks
of "Bagada and Axiam" (Mabillon's text) or "Axinarri" (still worse), he
means Baghdad and Ash-Shám (Syria, Damascus), the latter word puzzling
his Editor. Richardson (Dissert, lxxii.) seems to support a hideous
attempt to derive Shám from Shámat, a mole or wart, because the country
is studded with hillocks! Al-Shám is often applied to Damascus-city
whose proper name Dimishk belongs to books: this term is generally
derived from Dimáshik b. Káli b. Málik b. Sham (Shem). Lee (Ibn
Batùtah, 29) denies that ha-Dimishki means "Eliezer of Damascus."

[FN#141] From Oman = Eastern Arabia.

[FN#142] Arab. "Tamar Hannà" lit. date of Henna, but applied to the
flower of the eastern privet (Lawsonia inermis) which has the sweet
scent of freshly mown hay. The use of Henna as a dye is known even in
England. The "myrtle" alluded to may either have been for a perfume (as
it is held an anti-intoxicant) or for eating, the bitter aromatic
berries of the "Ás" being supposed to flavour wine and especially Raki
(raw brandy).

[FN#143] Lane. (i. 211) pleasantly remarks, "A list of these sweets is
given in my original, but I have thought it better to omit the names"
(!) Dozy does not shirk his duty, but he is not much more satisfactory
in explaining words interesting to students because they are unfound in
dictionaries and forgotten by the people. "Akrás (cakes) Laymunìyah (of
limes) wa Maymunìyah" appears in the Bresl. Edit. as "Ma'amuniyah"
which may mean "Ma'amun's cakes" or "delectable cakes." "Amshát" =
(combs) perhaps refers to a fine kind of Kunàfah (vermicelli) known in
Egypt and Syria as "Ghazl al-banát" = girl's spinning.

[FN#144] The new moon carefully looked for by all Moslems because it
begins the Ramazán-fast.

[FN#145] Solomon's signet ring has before been noticed.

[FN#146] The "high-bosomed" damsel, with breasts firm as a cube, is a
favourite with Arab tale tellers. Fanno baruffa is the Italian term for
hard breasts pointing outwards.

[FN#147] A large hollow navel is looked upon not only as a beauty, but
in children it is held a promise of good growth.

[FN#148] Arab. "Ka'ah," a high hall opening upon the central court: we
shall find the word used for a mansion, barrack, men's quarters, etc.

[FN#149] Babel = Gate of God (El), or Gate of Ilu (P. N. of God), which
the Jews ironically interpreted "Confusion." The tradition of Babylonia
being the very centre of witchcraft and enchantment by means of its
Seven Deadly Spirits, has survived in Al-Islam; the two fallen angels
(whose names will occur) being confined in a well; Nimrod attempting to
reach Heaven from the Tower in a magical car drawn by monstrous birds
and so forth. See p. 114, François Lenormant's "Chaldean Magic,"
London, Bagsters.

[FN#150] Arab. "Kámat Alfíyyah" = like the letter Alif, a straight
perpendicular stroke. In the Egyptian hieroglyphs, the origin of every
alphabet (not syllabarium) known to man, one form was a flag or leaf of
water-plant standing upright. Hence probably the Arabic Alif-shape;
while other nations preferred other modifications of the letter (ox's
head, etc), which in Egyptian number some thirty-six varieties, simple
and compound.

[FN#151] I have not attempted to order this marvellous confusion of
metaphors so characteristic of The Nights and the exigencies of
Al-Saj'a = rhymed prose.

[FN#152] Here and elsewhere I omit the "kála (dice Turpino)" of the
original: Torrens preserves "Thus goes the tale" (which it only
interrupts). This is simply letter-wise and sense-foolish.

[FN#153] Of this worthy more at a future time.

[FN#154] i.e., sealed with the Kazi or legal authority's seal of
office.

[FN#155] "Nothing for nothing" is a fixed idea with the Eastern woman:
not so much for greed as for a sexual point d' honneur when dealing
with the adversary—man.

[FN#156] She drinks first, the custom of the universal East, to show
that the wine she had bought was unpoisoned. Easterns, who utterly
ignore the "social glass" of Western civilisation drink honestly to get
drunk; and, when far gone are addicted to horse-play (in Pers.
"Badmasti" = le vin mauvais) which leads to quarrels and bloodshed.
Hence it is held highly irreverent to assert of patriarchs, prophets
and saints that they "drank wine;" and Moslems agree with our
"Teatotallers" in denying that, except in the case of Noah,
inebriatives are anywhere mentioned in Holy Writ.

[FN#157] Arab. "Húr al-Ayn," lit. (maids) with eyes of lively white and
black, applied to the virgins of Paradise who will wive with the happy
Faithful. I retain our vulgar "Houri," warning the reader that it is a
masc. for a fem. ("Huríyah") in Arab, although accepted in Persian, a
genderless speach.

[FN#158] Arab. "Zambúr," whose head is amputated in female
circumcision. See Night cccclxxiv.

[FN#159] Ocymum basilicum noticed in Introduction, the bassilico of
Boccaccio iv. 5. The Book of Kalilah and Dimnah represents it as
"sprouting with something also whose smell is foul and disgusting and
the sower at once sets to gather it and burn it with fire." (The Fables
of Bidpai translated from the later Syriac version by I. G. N.
Keith-Falconer, etc., etc., etc., Cambridge University Press, 1885).
Here, however, Habk is a pennyroyal (mentha puligium), and probably
alludes to the pecten.

[FN#160] i. e. common property for all to beat.

[FN#161] "A digit of the moon" is the Hindú equivalent.

[FN#162] Better known to us as Caravanserai, the "Travellers' Bungalow"
of India: in the Khan, however, shelter is to be had, but neither bed
nor board.

[FN#163] Arab. "Zubb." I would again note that this and its synonyms
are the equivalents of the Arabic, which is of the lowest. The
tale-teller's evident object is to accentuate the contrast with the
tragical stories to follow.

[FN#164] "ln the name of Allah," is here a civil form of dismissal.

[FN#165] Lane (i. 124) is scandalised and naturally enough by this
scene, which is the only blot in an admirable tale admirably told. Yet
even here the grossness is but little more pronounced than what we find
in our old drama (_e. g._, Shakespeare's King Henry V.) written for the
stage, whereas tales like The Nights are not read or recited before
both sexes. Lastly "nothing follows all this palming work:" in Europe
the orgie would end very differently. These "nuns of Theleme" are
physically pure: their debauchery is of the mind, not the body. Galland
makes them five, including the two doggesses.

[FN#166] So Sir Francis Walsingham's "They which do that they should
not, should hear that they would not."

[FN#167] The old "Calendar," pleasantly associated with that form of
almanac. The Mac. Edit. has Karandaliyah," a vile corruption, like Ibn
Batutah's "Karandar" and Torrens' "Kurundul:" so in English we have the
accepted vulgarism of "Kernel" for Colonel. The Bul. Edit. uses for
synonym "Su'ulúk"=an asker, a beggar. Of these mendicant monks, for
such they are, much like the Sarabaites of mediæval Europe, I have
treated and of their institutions and its founder, Shaykh Sharif Bu Ali
Kalandar (ob. A. H. 724 =1323-24), at some length in my "History of
Sindh," chapt. viii. See also the Dabistan (i. 136) where the good
Kalandar exclaims:—

     If the thorn break in my body, how trifling the pain!
     But how sorely I feel for the poor broken thorn!

D'Herbelot is right when he says that the Kalandar is not generally
approved by Moslems: he labours to win free from every form and
observance and he approaches the Malámati who conceals all his good
deeds and boasts of his evil doings—our "Devil's hypocrite."

[FN#168] The "Kalandar" disfigures himself in this manner to show
"mortification."

[FN#169] Arab. "Gharíb:" the porter is offended because the word
implies "poor devil;" esp. one out of his own country.

[FN#170] A religious mendicant generally.

[FN#171] Very scandalous to Moslem "respectability" Mohammed said the
house was accursed when the voices of women could be heard out of
doors. Moreover the neighbours have a right to interfere and abate the
scandal.

[FN#172] I need hardly say that these are both historical personages;
they will often be mentioned, and Ja'afar will be noticed in the
Terminal Essay.

[FN#173] Arab. "Sama ’an wa tá’atan"; a popular phrase of assent
generally translated "to hear is to obey;" but this formula may be and
must be greatly varied. In places it means "Hearing (the word of Allah)
and obeying" (His prophet, viceregent, etc.)

[FN#174] Arab. "Sawáb"=reward in Heaven. This word for which we have no
equivalent has been naturalized in all tongues (e. g. Hindostani)
spoken by Moslems.

[FN#175] Wine-drinking, at all times forbidden to Moslems, vitiates the
Pilgrimage rite: the Pilgrim is vowed to a strict observance of the
ceremonial law and many men date their "reformation" from the "Hajj."
Pilgrimage, iii., 126.

[FN#176] Here some change has been necessary; as the original text
confuses the three "ladies."

[FN#177] In Arab. the plural masc. is used by way of modesty when a
girl addresses her lover and for the same reason she speaks of herself
as a man.

[FN#178] Arab. "Al-Na'ím", in full "Jannat-al-Na'ím" = the Garden of
Delights, i.e. the fifth Heaven made of white silver. The generic name
of Heaven (the place of reward) is "Jannat," lit. a garden; "Firdaus"
being evidently derived from the Persian through the Greek παράδεισος,
and meaning a chase, a hunting park. Writers on this subject should
bear in mind Mandeville's modesty, "Of Paradise I cannot speak
properly, for I was not there."
