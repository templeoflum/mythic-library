ix.

[FN#225] The comparison is peculiarly apposite; the earth seen from
above appears hollow with a raised rim.

[FN#226] A hundred years old.

[FN#227] "Bahr" in Arab. means sea, river, piece of water; hence the
adjective is needed.

[FN#228] The Captain or Master of the ship (not the owner). In Al-Yaman
the word also means a "barber," in virtue of the root, Raas, a head.

[FN#229] The text has "in the character Ruká'í,"," or Riká'í,, the
correspondence-hand.

[FN#230] A curved character supposed to be like the basil-leaf
(rayhán). Richardson calls it "Rohani."

[FN#231] I need hardly say that Easterns use a reed, a Calamus (Kalam
applied only to the cut reed) for our quills and steel pens.

[FN#232] Famous for being inscribed on the Kiswah (cover) of Mohammed's
tomb; a large and more formal hand still used for engrossing and for
mural inscriptions. Only seventy two varieties of it are known
(Pilgrimage, ii., 82).

[FN#233] The copying and transcribing hand which is either Arabi or
Ajami. A great discovery has been lately made which upsets all our old
ideas of Cufic, etc. Mr. Löytved of Bayrut has found, amongst the
Hauranic inscriptions, one in pure Naskhi, dating A. D. 568, or fifty
years before the Hijrah; and it is accepted as authentic by my learned
friend M. Ch. Clermont-Ganneau (p. 193, Pal. Explor. Fund. July 1884).
In D'Herbelot and Sale's day the Koran was supposed to have been
written in rude characters, like those subsequently called "Cufic,"
invented shortly before Mohammed's birth by Murámir ibn Murrah of Anbar
in Irák, introduced into Meccah by Bashar the Kindian, and perfected by
Ibn Muklah (Al-Wazir, ob. A. H. 328=940). We must now change all that.
See Catalogue of Oriental Caligraphs, etc., by G. P, Badger, London,
Whiteley, 1885.

[FN#234] Capital and uncial letters; the hand in which the Ka'abah veil
is inscribed (Pilgrimage iii. 299, 300).

[FN#235] A "Court hand" says Mr. Payne (i. 112): I know nothing of it.
Other hands are: the Ta'alík; hanging or oblique, used for finer MSS.
and having, according to Richardson, "the same analogy to the Naskhi as
our Italic has to the Roman." The Nasta' lík (not Naskh-Ta'alik) much
used in India, is, as the name suggests, a mixture of the Naskhi
(writing of transactions) and the Ta'alik. The Shikastah (broken hand)
everywhere represents our running hand and becomes a hard task to the
reader. The Kirmá is another cursive character, mostly confined to the
receipts and disbursements of the Turkish treasury. The Diváni, or
Court (of Justice) is the official hand, bold and round. a business
character, the lines often rising with a sweep or curve towards the
(left) end. The Jáli or polished has a variety, the Jali-Ta'alik: the
Sulsi (known in many books) is adopted for titles of volumes, royal
edicts, diplomas and so forth; "answering much the same purpose as
capitals with us, or the flourished letters in illuminated manuscripts"
(Richardson) The Tughrái is that of the Tughrá, the Prince's cypher or
flourishing signature in ceremonial writings, and containing some such
sentence as: Let this be executed. There are others e. g. Yákuti and
Sirenkil known only by name. Finally the Maghribi (Moorish) hand
differs in form and diacritical points from the characters used further
east almost as much as German running hand does from English. It is
curious that Richardson omits the Jali (intricate and convoluted) and
the divisions of the Sulusí, Sulsi or Sulus (Thuluth) character, the
Sulus al-Khafíf, etc.

[FN#236] Arab. "Baghlah"; the male (Baghl) is used only for loads. This
is everywhere the rule: nothing is more unmanageable than a restive
"Macho", and he knows that he can always get you off his back when so
minded. From "Baghlah" is derived the name of the native craft
Anglo-Indicè a "Buggalow."

[FN#237] In Heb. ""Ben-Adam" is any man opp. to "Beni ish" (Psalm iv.
3) =filii viri, not homines.

[FN#238] This posture is terribly trying to European legs; and few
white men (unless brought up to it) can squat for any time on their
heels. The “tailor-fashion,” with crossed legs, is held to be free and
easy.

[FN#239] Arab. "Katá"=Pterocles Alchata, the well-known sand-grouse of
the desert. It is very poor white flesh.

[FN#240] Arab. “Khubz” which I do not translate “cake” or “bread,” as
that would suggest the idea of our loaf. The staff of life in the East
is a thin flat circle of dough baked in the oven or on the griddle, and
corresponding with the Scotch “scone,” the Spanish tortilla and the
Australian “flap-jack.”

[FN#241] Arab. "Harísah," a favourite dish of wheat (or rice) boiled
and reduced to a paste with shredded meat, spices and condiments. The
"bangles" is a pretty girl eating with him.

[FN#242] These lines are repeated with a difference in Night cccxxx.
They affect Rims cars, out of the way, heavy rhymes: e. g. here Sakáríj
(plur. of Sakrúj, platters, porringers); Tayáhíj (plur. of Tayhúj, the
smaller caccabis-partridge); Tabáhíj (Persian Tabahjah, an omelet or a
stew of meat, onions, eggs, etc.) Ma'áríj ("in stepped piles" like the
pyramids; which Lane ii. 495, renders "on the stairs"); Makáríj (plur.
of Makraj, a small pot); Damálíj (plur. of dumlúj, a bracelet, a
bangle); Dayábíj (brocades) and Tafáríj (openings, enjoyments). In
Night cccxxx. we find also Sikábíj (plur. of Sikbáj, marinated meat
elsewhere explained); Faráríj (plur. of farrúj, a chicken, vulg. farkh)
and Dakákíj (plur. of dakújah, a small jar). In the first line we have
also (though not a rhyme) Gharánik Gr. Γερανὸς, a crane, preserved in
Romaic. The weeping and wailing are caused by the remembrance that all
these delicacies have been demolished like a Badawi camp.

[FN#243] This is the vinum coctum, the boiled wine, still a favourite
in Southern Italy and Greece.

[FN#244] Eastern topers delight in drinking at dawn: upon this subject
I shall have more to say in other Nights.

[FN#245] Arab. "Adab," a crux to translators, meaning anything between
good education and good manners. In mod. Turk. "Edibiyyet" (Adabiyat) =
belles lettres and "Edebi' or "Edíb" = a littérateur.

[FN#246] The Caliph Al-Maamún, who was a bad player, used to say, "I
have the administration of the world and am equal to it, whereas I am
straitened in the ordering of a space of two spans by two spans." The
"board" was then "a square field of well-dressed leather."

[FN#247] The Rabbis (after Matth. xix. 12) count three kinds of
Eunuchs; (1) Seris chammah=of the sun, i.e. natural, (2) Seris
Adam=manufactured per homines; and (3) Seris Chammayim—of God (i.e..
religious abstainer). Seris (castrated) or Abd (slave) is the general
Hebrew name.

[FN#248] The "Lady of Beauty."

[FN#249] "Káf" has been noticed as the mountain which surrounds earth
as a ring does the finger:: it is popularly used like our Alp and
Alpine. The "circumambient Ocean" (Bahr al-muhit) is the Homeric
Ocean-stream.

[FN#250] The pomegranate is probably chosen here because each fruit is
supposed to contain one seed from Eden-garden. Hence a host of
superstitions (Pilgrimage iii., 104) possibly connected with the
Chaldaic-Babylonian god Rimmon or Ramanu. Hence Persephone or Ishtar
tasted the "rich pomegranate's seed." Lenormant, loc. cit. pp. 166,
182.

[FN#251] i.e. for the love of God—a favourite Moslem phrase.

[FN#252] Arab. "Báb," also meaning a chapter (of magic, of war, etc.),
corresponding with the Persian "Dar" as in Sad-dar, the Hundred Doors.
Here, however, it is figurative "I tried a new mode." This scene is in
the Mabinogion.

[FN#253] I use this Irish term = crying for the dead, as English wants
the word for the præfica, or myrialogist. The practice is not
encouraged in Al-Islam; and Caliph Abu Bakr said, ; "Verily a corpse is
sprinkled with boiling water by reason of the lamentations of the
living, i.e. punished for not having taken measures to prevent their
profitless lamentations. But the practice is from Negroland whence it
reached Egypt, and the people have there developed a curious system in
the "weeping-song" I have noted this in "The Lake Regions of Central
Africa." In Zoroastrianism (Dabistan, chapt. xcvii.) tears shed for the
dead form a river in hell, black and frigid.

[FN#254] These lines are hardly translatable. Arab. "Sabr" means
"patience" as well as "aloes," hereby lending itself to a host of puns
and double entendres more or less vile. The aloe, according to
Burckhardt, is planted in graveyards as a lesson of patience: it is
also slung, like the dried crocodile, over house doors to prevent evil
spirits entering: "thus hung without earth and water," says Lane (M.E.,
chapt. xi.), "it will live for several years and even blossom. Hence
(?) it is called Sabr, which signifies patience. But Sibr as well as
Sabr (a root) means "long sufferance." I hold the practice to be one of
the many Inner African superstitions. The wild Gallas to the present
day plant aloes on graves, and suppose that when the plant sprouts the
deceased has been admitted to the gardens of Wák, the Creator.
(Pilgrimage iii. 350.)

[FN#255] Every city in the East has its specific title: this was given
to Baghdad either on account of its superior police or simply because
it was the Capital of the Caliphate. The Tigris was also called the
"River of Peace (or Security)."

[FN#256] This is very characteristic: the passengers finding themselves
in difficulties at once take command. See in my Pilgrimage (I. chapt.
xi.) how we beat and otherwise maltreated the Captain of the "Golden
Wire."

[FN#257] The fable is probably based on the currents which, as in
Eastern Africa, will carry a ship fifty miles a day out of her course.
We first find it in Ptolemy (vii. 2) whose Maniólai Islands, of India
extra Gangem, cause iron nails to fly out of ships, the effect of the
Lapis Herculeus (Loadstone). Rabelais (v. c. 37) alludes to it and to
the vulgar idea of magnetism being counteracted by Skordon (Scordon or
garlic). Hence too the Adamant (Loadstone) Mountains of Mandeville
(chapt. xxvii.) and the "Magnetic Rock" in Mr Puttock's clever "Peter
Wilkins." I presume that the myth also arose from seeing craft built,
as on the East African Coast, without iron nails. We shall meet with
the legend again. The word Jabal ("Jebel" in Egypt) often occurs in
these pages. The Arabs apply it to any rising ground or heap of rocks;
so it is not always = our mountain. It has found its way to Europe e.
g. Gibraltar and Monte Gibello (or Mongibel in poetry) "Mt. Ethne that
men clepen Mounte Gybelle." Other special senses of Jabal will occur.

[FN#258] As we learn from the Nubian Geographer the Arabs in early ages
explored the Fortunate Islands (Jazírát al-Khálidát=Eternal Isles), or
Canaries, on one of which were reported a horse and horseman in bronze
with his spear pointing west. Ibn al-Wardi notes two images of hard
stone, each an hundred cubits high, and upon the top of each a figure
of copper pointing with its hand backwards, as though it would
say:—Return for there is nothing behind me!" But this legend attaches
to older doings. The 23rd Tobba (who succeeded Bilkis), Malik bin
Sharhabíl, (or Sharabíl or Sharahíl) surnamed Náshir al-Ní'am=scatterer
of blessings, lost an army in attempting the Western sands and set up a
statue of copper upon whose breast was inscribed in antique
characters:—

     There is no access behind me,
     Nothing beyond,
     (Saith) The Son of Sharabíl.

[FN#259] i.e. I exclaimed "Bismillah!"

[FN#260] The lesser ablution of hands, face and feet; a kind of
"washing the points." More in Night ccccxl.

[FN#261] Arab. "Ruka'tayn"; the number of these bows which are followed
by the prostrations distinguishes the five daily prayers.

[FN#262] The "Beth Kol" of the Hebrews; also called by the Moslems
"Hátif"; for which ask the Spiritualists. It is the Hindu "voice
divine" or "voice from heaven."

[FN#263] These formulae are technically called Tasmiyah, Tahlil (before
noted) and Takbír: the "testifying" is Tashhíd.

[FN#264] Arab. "Samn," (Pers. "Raughan" Hind. "Ghi") the "single sauce"
of the East; fresh butter set upon the fire, skimmed and kept (for a
century if required) in leather bottles and demijohns. Then it becomes
a hard black mass, considered a panacea for wounds and diseases. It is
very "filling": you say jocosely to an Eastern threatened with a sudden
inroad of guests, "Go, swamp thy rice with Raughan." I once tried
training, like a Hindu Pahlawan or athlete, on Gur (raw sugar), milk
and Ghi; and the result was being blinded by bile before the week
ended.

[FN#265] These handsome youths are always described in the terms we
should apply to women.

[FN#266] The Bul. Edit. (i. 43) reads otherwise:—I found a garden and a
second and a third and so on till they numbered thirty and nine; and,
in each garden, I saw what praise will not express, of trees and rills
and fruits and treasures. At the end of the last I sighted a door and
said to myself, "What may be in this place?; needs must I open it and
look in!" I did so accordingly and saw a courser ready saddled and
bridled and picketed; so I loosed and mounted him, and he flew with me
like a bird till he set me down on a terrace-roof; and, having landed
me, he struck me a whisk with his tail and put out mine eye and fled
from me. Thereupon I descended from the roof and found ten youths all
blind of one eye who, when they saw me exclaimed, "No welcome to thee,
and no good cheer!" I asked them, "Do ye admit me to your home and
society?" and they answered, "No, by Allah' thou shalt not live amongst
us." So I went forth with weeping eyes and grieving heart, but Allah
had written my safety on the Guarded Tablet so I reached Baghdad in
safety, etc. This is a fair specimen of how the work has been curtailed
in that issue.

[FN#267] Arabs date pregnancy from the stopping of the menses, upon
which the foetus is supposed to feed. Kalilah wa Dimnah says, "The
child's navel adheres to that of his mother and thereby he sucks" (i.
263).

[FN#268] This is contrary to the commands of Al-Islam, Mohammed
expressly said "The Astrologers are liars, by the Lord of the
Ka'abah!"; and his saying is known to almost all Moslems, lettered or
unlettered. Yet, the further we go East (Indiawards) the more we find
these practices held in honour. Turning westwards we have:

     Iuridicis, Erebo, Fisco, fas vivere rapto:
     Militibus, Medicis, Tortori occidere ludo est;
     Mentiri Astronomis, Pictoribus atque Poetis.

[FN#269] He does not perform the Wuzu or lesser ablution because he
neglects his dawn prayers.

[FN#270] For this game see Lane (M. E. Chapt. xvii.) It is usually
played on a checked cloth not on a board like our draughts; and
Easterns are fond of eating, drinking and smoking between and even
during the games. Torrens (p. 142) translates "I made up some dessert,"
confounding "Mankalah" with "Nukl" (dried fruit, quatre-mendiants).

[FN#271] Quoted from Mohammed whose saying has been given.

[FN#272] We should say "the night of the thirty-ninth."

[FN#273] The bath first taken after sickness.

[FN#274] Arab. "Dikák" used by way of soap or rather to soften the
skin: the meal is usually of lupins, "Adas"="Revalenta Arabica," which
costs a penny in Egypt and half-a-crown in England.

[FN#275] Arab. "Sukkar-nabát." During my day (1842-49) we had no other
sugar in the Bombay Presidency.

[FN#276] This is one of the myriad Arab instances that the decrees of
"Anagké," Fate, Destiny, Weird, are inevitable. The situation is highly
dramatic; and indeed The Nights, as will appear in the Terminal Essay,
have already suggested a national drama.

[FN#277] Having lately been moved by Ajib.

[FN#278] Mr. Payne (i. 131) omits these lines which appear out of
place; but this mode of inappropriate quotation is a characteristic of
Eastern tales.

[FN#279] Anglicè "him."

[FN#280] This march of the tribe is a lieu commun of Arab verse e.g.
the poet Labid's noble elegy on the "Deserted Camp." We shall find
scores of instances in The Nights.

[FN#281] I have heard of such sands in the Desert east of Damascus
which can be crossed only on boards or camel furniture; and the same is
reported of the infamous Region "Al-Ahkáf" ("Unexplored Syria").

[FN#282] Hence the Arab. saying "The bark of a dog and not the gleam of
a fire;" the tired traveller knows from the former that the camp is
near, whereas the latter shows from great distances.

[FN#283] Dark blue is the colour of mourning in Egypt as it was of the
Roman Republic. The Persians hold that this tint was introduced by Kay
Kawús (B. C. 600) when mourning for his son Siyáwush. It was continued
till the death of Husayn on the 10th of Muharram (the first month, then
representing the vernal equinox) when it was changed for black. As a
rule Moslems do not adopt this symbol of sorrow (called "Hidád")
looking upon the practice as somewhat idolatrous and foreign to Arab
manners. In Egypt and especially on the Upper Nile women dye their
hands with indigo and stain their faces black or blacker.

[FN#284] The older Roc, of which more in the Tale of Sindbad. Meanwhile
the reader curious about the Persian Símurgh (thirty bird) will consult
the Dabistan, i., 55,191 and iii., 237, and Richardson's Diss. p.
xlviii. For the Anka (Enka or Unka—long necked bird) see Dab. iii., 249
and for the Humá (bird of Paradise) Richardson lxix. We still lack
details concerning the Ben or Bennu (nycticorax) of Egypt which with
the Article pi gave rise to the Greek "phoenix."

[FN#285] Probably the Haledj of Forskal (p. xcvi. Flor. Ægypt. Arab.),
"lignum tenax, durum, obscuri generis." The Bres. Edit. has "ákúl"=teak
wood, vulg. "Sáj."

[FN#286] The knocker ring is an invention well known to the Romans.

[FN#287] Arab. "Sadr"; the place of honour; hence the "Sudder Adawlut"
(Supreme Court) in the Anglo-Indian jargon.

[FN#288] Arab. "Ahlan wa sahlan wa marhabá," the words still popularly
addressed to a guest.

[FN#289] This may mean "liquid black eyes"; but also, as I have
noticed, that the lashes were long and thick enough to make the eyelids
appear as if Kohl-powder had been applied to the inner rims.

[FN#290] A slight parting between the two front incisors, the upper
only, is considered a beauty by Arabs; why it as hard to say except for
the racial love of variety. "Sughr" (Thugr) in the text means,
primarily, the opening of the mouth, the gape: hence the front teeth.

[FN#291] i.e. makes me taste the bitterness of death, "bursting the
gall-bladder" (Marárah) being our "breaking the heart."

[FN#292] Almost needless to say that forbidden doors and rooms form a
lieu-commun in Fairie: they are found in the Hindu Katha Sarit Sagara
and became familiar to our childhood by "Bluebeard."

[FN#293] Lit. "apply Kohl to my eyes," even as Jezebel "painted her
face," in Heb. put her eyes in painting (2 Kings ix. 30).

[FN#294] Arab. "Al-Barkúk," whence our older "Apricock." Classically it
is "Burkúk" and Pers. for Arab. "Mishrnish," and it also denotes a
small plum or damson. In Syria the side next the sun" shows a glowing
red flush.

[FN#295] Arab. "Hazár" (in Persian, a thousand) = a kind of mocking
bird.

[FN#296] Some Edits. make the doors number a hundred, but the
Princesses were forty and these coincidences, which seem to have
significance and have none save for Arab symmetromania, are common in
Arab stories.

[FN#297] Arab. "Májur": hence possibly our "mazer," which is popularly
derived from Masarn, a maple.

[FN#298] A compound scent of ambergris, musk and aloes.

[FN#299] The ends of the bridle-reins forming the whip.

[FN#300] The flying horse is Pegasus which is a Greek travesty of an
Egyptian myth developed India.

[FN#301] The Bres. Edit. wrongly says "the seventh."

[FN#302] Arab. "Sharmutah" (plur. Sharámít) from the root Sharmat, to
shred, a favourite Egyptian word also applied in vulgar speech to a
strumpet, a punk, a piece. It is also the popular term for strips of
jerked or boucaned meat hung up m the sun to dry, and classically
called "Kadíd."

[FN#303] Arab. "Izár," the man's waistcloth opposed to the Ridá or
shoulder-cloth, is also the sheet of white calico worn by the poorer
Egyptian women out of doors and covering head and hands. See Lane (M.
E., chapt. i.). The rich prefer a "Habárah" of black silk, and the
poor, when they have nothing else, use a bed-sheet.

[FN#304] i.e. "My dears."

[FN#305] Arab. "Lá tawákhizná:" lit. "do not chastise (or blame) us;"
the pop. expression for, "excuse (or pardon) us."

[FN#306] Arab. "Maskhút," mostly applied to change of shape as man
enchanted to monkey, and in vulgar parlance applied to a statue (of
stone, etc.). The list of metamorphoses in Al-Islam is longer than that
known to Ovid. Those who have seen Petra, the Greek town of the Haurán
and the Roman ruins in Northern Africa will readily detect the basis
upon which these stories are built. I shall return to this subject in
The City of Iram (Night cclxxvi.) and The City of Brass (dlxvii.).

[FN#307] A picturesque phrase enough to express a deserted site, a
spectacle familiar to the Nomades and always abounding in pathos to the
citizens.

[FN#308] The olden "Harem" (or gynæceum, Pers. Zenanah, Serraglio):
Harím is also used by synecdoche for the inmates; especially the wife.

[FN#309] The pearl is supposed in the East to lose 1% per ann. of its
splendour and value.

[FN#310] Arab. "Fass," properly the bezel of a ring; also a gem cut en
cabochon and generally the contenant for the contenu.

[FN#311] Arab. "Mihráb" = the arch-headed niche in the Mosque-wall
facing Meccah-wards. Here, with his back to the people and fronting the
Ka'abah or Square House of Meccah (hence called the "Kiblah" =
direction of prayer), stations himself the Imám, antistes or fugleman,
lit. "one who stands before others;" and his bows and prostrations give
the time to the congregation. I have derived the Mihrab from the niche
in which the Egyptian God was shrined: the Jews ignored it, but the
Christians preserved it for their statues and altars. Maundrell
suggests that the empty niche denotes an invisible God. As the niche
(symbol of Venus) and the minaret (symbol of Priapus) date only from
the days of the tenth Caliph, Al-Walid (A.H. 86-96=105-115), the Hindus
charge the Moslems with having borrowed the two from their favourite
idols—The Linga-Yoni or Cunnus phallus (Pilgrimage ii. 140), and
plainly call the Mihrab a Bhaga= Cunnus (Dabistan ii. 152). The Guebres
further term Meccah "Mah-gah," locus Lunæ, and Al-Medinah, "Mahdinah,"
= Moon of religion. See Dabistan i., 49, etc.

[FN#312] Arab "Kursi," a stool of palm-fronds, etc., X-shaped (see
Lane's illustration, Nights i., 197), before which the reader sits.
Good Moslems will not hold the Holy Volume below the waist nor open it
except when ceremonially pure. Englishmen in the East should remember
this, for to neglect the "Adab al-Kúran" (respect due to Holy Writ)
gives great scandal.

[FN#313] Mr. Payne (i. 148) quotes the German Zuckerpüppchen.

[FN#314] The Persian poets have a thousand conceits in praise of the
"mole," (Khál or Shámah) for which Hafiz offered "Samarkand and
Bokhara" (they not being his, as his friends remarked). Another "topic"
is the flight of arrows shot by eyelashes.

[FN#315] Arab. "Suhá" a star in the Great Bear introduced only to
balance "wushát" = spies, enviers, enemies, whose "evil eye" it will
ward off.

[FN#316] In Arab tales beauty is always "soft-sided," and a smooth skin
is valued in proportion to its rarity.

[FN#317] The myrtle is the young hair upon the side face

[FN#318] In other copies of these verses the fourth couplet swears "by
the scorpions of his brow" _i.e._ the _accroche-cœurs_, the
beau-catchers, bell-ropes or aggravators," as the B.P. calls them. In
couplet eight the poet alludes to his love's "Unsur," or element his
nature made up of the four classicals, and in the last couplet he makes
the nail paring refer to the moon not the sun.

[FN#319] This is regular formula when speaking of Guebres.

[FN#320] Arab. "Faráiz"; the orders expressly given in the Koran which
the reader will remember, is Uncreate and Eternal. In India "Farz" is
applied to injunctions thrice repeated; and "Wájíb" to those given
twice over. Elsewhere scanty difference is made between them.

[FN#321] Arab. "Kufr" = rejecting the True Religion, i.e. Al-Islam,
such rejection being "Tughyán" or rebellion against the Lord. The
"terrible sound" is taken from the legend of the prophet Sálih and the
proto-historic tribe of Thámúd which for its impiety was struck dead by
an earthquake and a noise from heaven. The latter, according to some
commentators, was the voice of the Archangel Gabriel crying "Die all of
you" (Koran, chapts. vii., xviii., etc.). We shall hear more of it in
the "City of many-coloured Iram." According to some, Salih, a
mysterious Badawi prophet, is buried in the Wady al-Shaykh of the
so-called Sinaitic Peninsula.

[FN#322] Yet they kept the semblance of man, showing that the idea
arose from the basaltic statues found in Hauranic ruins. Mohammed in
his various marches to Syria must have seen remnants of Greek and Roman
settlements; and as has been noticed "Sesostris" left his mark near
Meccah. (Pilgrimage iii. 137).

[FN#323] Arab. "Shuhadá"; highly respected by Moslems as by other
religionists; although their principal if not only merit seems as a
rule to have been intense obstinacy and devotion to one idea for which
they were ready to sacrifice even life. The Martyrs-category is
extensive including those killed by falling walls; victims to the
plague, pleurisy and pregnancy, travellers drowned or otherwise lost
when journeying honestly, and chaste lovers who die of "broken hearts"
i.e. impaired digestion. Their souls are at once stowed away in the
crops of green birds where they remain till Resurrection Day, "eating
of the fruits and drinking of the streams of Paradise," a place
however, whose topography is wholly uncertain. Thus the young Prince
was rewarded with a manner of anti-Purgatory, a preparatory heaven.

[FN#324] Arab. "Su'ubán:" the Badawin give the name to a variety of
serpents all held to be venomous; but in tales the word, like "Tannín,"
expresses our "dragon" or "cockatrice."

[FN#325] She was ashamed to see the lady doing servile duty by rubbing
her feet. This massage, which B. de la Brocquière describes in 1452 as
"kneading and pinching," has already been noticed. The French term is
apparently derived from the Arab. "Mas-h."

[FN#326] Alluding to the Most High Name, the hundredth name of God, the
Heb. Shem hamphorash, unknown save to a favoured few who by using it
perform all manner of miracles.

[FN#327] i e. the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean.

[FN#328] i.e. Settled by the Koran.

[FN#329] The uglier the old woman the better procuress she is supposed
to make. See the Santa Verdiana in Boccaccio v., 10. In Arab. "Ajuz"
(old woman) is highly insulting and if addressed to an Egyptian,
whatever be her age she will turn fiercely and resent it. The polite
term is Shaybah (Pilgrimage hi., 200).

[FN#330] The four ages of woman, considered after Demosthenes in her
three-fold character, prostitute for pleasure, concubine for service
and wife for breeding.

[FN#331] Arab. "Jilá" (the Hindostani Julwa) = the displaying of the
bride before the bridegroom for the first time, in different dresses,
to the number of seven which are often borrowed for the occasion. The
happy man must pay a fee called "the tax of face-unveiling" before he
can see her features. Amongst Syrian Christians he sometimes tries to
lift the veil by a sharp movement of the sword which is parried by the
women present, and the blade remains entangled in the cloth. At last he
succeeds, the bride sinks to the ground covering her face with her
hands and the robes of her friends: presently she is raised up, her
veil is readjusted and her face is left bare.

[FN#332] Arab. "Ishá"= the first watch of the night, twilight,
supper-time, supper. Moslems have borrowed the four watches of the
Romans from 6 (a.m. or p.m.) to 6, and ignore the three original
watches of the Jews, even, midnight and cockcrow (Sam. ii. 19, Judges
vii. 19, and Exodus xiv. 24).

[FN#333] A popular Arab hyperbole.

[FN#334] Arab. "Shakáik al-Nu'uman," lit. the fissures of Nu'uman, the
beautiful anemone, which a tyrannical King of Hirah, Nu'uman ibn
Al-Munzir, a contemporary of Mohammed, attempted to monopolize.

[FN#335] Arab. "Andam"=here the gum called dragon's blood; in other
places the dye-wood known as brazil.

[FN#336] I need hardly say that in the East, where bells are unused,
clapping the hands summons the servants. In India men cry "Quy hye"
(Koi hái?) and in Brazil whistle "Pst!" after the fashion of Spain and
Portugal.

[FN#337] The moles are here compared with pearls; a simile by no means
common or appropriate.

[FN#338] A parody on the testification of Allah's Unity.

[FN#339] Arab. "Simát" (prop. "Sumát"); the "dinner-table," composed of
a round wooden stool supporting a large metal tray, the two being
called "Sufrah" (or "Simat"): thus "Sufrah házirah!" means dinner is on
the table. After the meal they are at once removed.

[FN#340] In the text "Dastúr," the Persian word before noticed; "Izn"
would be the proper Arabic equivalent.

[FN#341] In the Moslem East a young woman, single or married, is not
allowed to appear alone in the streets; and the police have a right to
arrest delinquents. As a preventive of intrigues the precaution is
excellent. During the Crimean war hundreds of officers, English, French
and Italian, became familiar with Constantinople; and not a few
flattered themselves on their success with Turkish women. I do not
believe that a single bona fide case occurred: the "conquests" were all
Greeks, Wallachians, Armenians or Jewesses.

[FN#342] Arab. "Azím": translators do not seem to know that this word
in The Nights often bears its Egyptian and slang sense, somewhat
equivalent to our "deuced" or "mighty" or "awfully fine."

[FN#343] This is a very serious thing amongst Moslems and scrupulous
men often make great sacrifices to avoid taking an oath.

[FN#344] We should say "into the noose."

[FN#345] The man had fallen in love with her and determined to mark her
so that she might be his.

[FN#346] Arab. "Dajlah," in which we find the Heb. Hid-dekel.

[FN#347] Such an execution would be contrary to Moslem law: but people
would look leniently upon the peccadillo of beheading or sacking a
faithless wife. Moreover the youth was of the blood royal and _A quoi
bon être prince?_ as was said by a boy of viceroyal family in Egypt to
his tutor who reproached him for unnecessarily shooting down a poor old
man.

[FN#348] Arab. "Shirk," partnership, evening or associating gods with
God; polytheism: especially levelled at the Hindu triadism, Guebre
dualism and Christian Trinitarianism.

[FN#349] Arab. "Shatm"—abuse, generally couched in foulest language
with especial reference to the privy parts of female relatives.

[FN#350] When a woman is bastinadoed in the East they leave her some
portion of dress and pour over her sundry buckets of water for a
delicate consideration. When the hands are beaten they are passed
through holes in the curtain separating the sufferer from mankind, and
made fast to a "falakah" or pole.

[FN#351] Arab. "Khalifah," Caliph. The word is also used for the
successor of a Santon or holy man.

[FN#352] Arab. "Sár," here the Koranic word for carrying out the
venerable and undying lex talionis the original basis of all criminal
jurisprudence. Its main fault is that justice repeats the offence.

[FN#353] Both these sons of Harun became Caliphs, as we shall see in
The Nights.

[FN#354] "Dog" and "hog" are still highly popular terms of abuse. The
Rabbis will not defile their lips with "pig;" but say "Dabhar
akhir"="another thing."

[FN#355] The "hero eponymus" of the Abbaside dynasty, Abbas having been
the brother of Abdullah the father of Mohammed. He is a famous
personage in AI-Islam (D'Herbelot).

[FN#356] Europe translates the word "Barmecides. It is Persian from bar
(up) and makidan (to suck). The vulgar legend is that Ja'afar, the
first of the name, appeared before the Caliph Abd al-Malik with a ring
poisoned for his own need; and that the Caliph, warned of it by the
clapping of two stones which he wore ad hoc, charged the visitor with
intention to murder him. He excused himself and in his speech occurred
the Persian word "Barmakam," which may mean "I shall sup it up," or "I
am a Barmak," that is, a high priest among the Guebres. See D'Herbelot
s.v.

[FN#357] Arab."Zulm," the deadliest of monarch's sins. One of the
sayings of Mohammed, popularly quoted, is, "Kingdom endureth with Kufr
or infidelity (i. e. without accepting AI-Islam) but endureth not with
Zulm or injustice." Hence the good Moslem will not complain of the rule
of Kafirs or Unbelievers, like the English, so long as they rule him
righteously and according to his own law.]

[FN#358] All this aggravates his crime: had she been a widow she would
not have had upon him "the claims of maidenhead," the premio della
verginita of Boccaccio, x. 10.

[FN#359] It is supposed that slaves cannot help telling these fatal
lies. Arab story-books are full of ancient and modern instances and
some have become "Joe Millers." Moreover it is held unworthy of a
free-born man to take over-notice of these servile villanies; hence the
scoundrel in the story escapes unpunished. I have already noticed the
predilection of debauched women for these "skunks of the human race;"
and the young man in the text evidently suspected that his wife had
passed herself this "little caprice." The excuse which the Caliph would
find for him is the pundonor shown in killing one he loved so fondly.

[FN#360] The Arab equivalent of our pitcher and well.

[FN#361] i.e. Where the dress sits loosely about the bust.

[FN#362] He had trusted in Allah and his trust was justified.

[FN#363] Arab. "Khila'ah" prop. what a man strips from his person: gen.
an honorary gift. It is something more than the "robe of honour" of our
chivalrous romances, as it includes a horse, a sword (often
gold-hilted), a black turban (amongst the Abbasides) embroidered with
gold, a violet-coloured mantle, a waist-shawl and a gold neck-chain and
shoe-buckles.

[FN#364] Arab. "Izá," i.e. the visits of condolence and so forth which
are long and terribly wearisome in the Moslem East.

[FN#365] Arab. "Mahr," the money settled by the man before marriage on
the woman and without which the contract is not valid. Usually half of
it is paid down on the marriage-day and the other half when the husband
dies or divorces his wife. But if she take a divorce she forfeits her
right to it, and obscene fellows, especially Persians, often compel her
to demand divorce by unnatural and preposterous use of her person.

[FN#366] Bismillah here means "Thou art welcome to it."

[FN#367] Arab. "Bassak," half Pers. (bas = enough) and—ak = thou; for
thee. "Bas" sounds like our "buss" (to kiss) and there are sundry good
old Anglo-Indian jokes of feminine mistakes on the subject.

[FN#368] This saving clause makes the threat worse. The scene between
the two brothers is written with characteristic Arab humour; and it is
true to nature. In England we have heard of a man who separated from
his wife because he wished to dine at six and she preferred half-past
six.

[FN#369] Arab. "Misr." (vulg. Masr). The word, which comes of a very
ancient house, was applied to the present capital about the time of its
conquest by the Osmanli Turks A.H. 923 = 1517.

[FN#370] The Arab. "Jízah," = skirt, edge; the modern village is the
site of an ancient Egyptian city, as the "Ghizah inscription" proves
(Brugsch, History of Egypt, ii. 415)

[FN#371] Arab. "Watan" literally meaning "birth-place" but also used
for "patria, native country"; thus "Hubb al-Watan" = patriotism. The
Turks pronounce it "Vatan," which the French have turned into Va-t'en!

[FN#372] Arab. "Zarzariyah" = the colour of a stare or starling
(Zurzúr).

[FN#373] Now a Railway Station on the Alexandria-Cairo line.

[FN#374] Even as late as 1852, when I first saw Cairo, the city was
girt by waste lands and the climate was excellent. Now cultivation
comes up to the house walls; while the Mahmudiyah Canal, the planting
the streets with avenues and over-watering have seriously injured it;
those who want the air of former Cairo must go to Thebes. Gout,
rheumatism and hydrophobia (before unknown) have become common of late
years.

[FN#375] This is the popular pronunciation: Yakút calls it "Bilbís."

[FN#376] An outlying village on the "Long Desert," between Cairo and
Palestine.

[FN#377] Arab. "Al-Kuds" = holiness. There are few cities which in our
day have less claim to this title than Jerusalem; and, curious to say,
the "Holy Land" shows Jews, Christians and Moslems all in their worst
form. The only religion (if it can be called one) which produces men in
Syria is the Druse. "Heiligen-landes Jüden" are proverbial and nothing
can be meaner than the Christians while the Moslems are famed for
treachery.

[FN#378] Arab. "Shamm al-hawá." In vulgar parlance to "smell the air"
is to take a walk, especially out of town. There is a peculiar Egyptian
festival called "Shamm al-Nasím" (smelling the Zephyr) which begins on
Easter-Monday (O.S.), thus corresponding with the Persian Nau-roz,
vernal equinox and introducing the fifty days of "Khammasín" or
"Mirísi" (hot desert winds). On awakening, the people smell and bathe
their temples with vinegar in which an onion has been soaked and break
their fast with a "fisikh" or dried "búri" = mullet from Lake Menzalah:
the late Hekekiyan Bey had the fish-heads counted in one public garden
and found 70,000. The rest of the day is spent out of doors "Gypsying,"
and families greatly enjoy themselves on these occasions. For a longer
description, see a paper by my excellent friend Yacoub Artin Pasha, in
the Bulletin de l'Institut Égyptien, 2nd series, No. 4, Cairo, 1884. I
have noticed the Mirísi (south-wester) and other winds in the Land of
Midian, i., 23.

[FN#379] So in the days of the "Mameluke Beys" in Egypt a man of rank
would not cross the street on foot.

[FN#380] Arab. Basrah. The city is now in decay and not to flourish
again till the advent of the Euphrates Valley R.R., is a modern place,
founded in A.H. 15, by the Caliph Omar upon the Aylah, a feeder of the
Tigris. Here, according to Al-Haríri, the "whales and the lizards
meet," and, as the tide affects the river,

Its stream shows prodigy, ebbing and flowing.

In its far-famed market-place, Al-Marbad, poems used to be recited; and
the city was famous for its mosques and Saint-shrines, fair women and
school of Grammar which rivalled that of Kúfah. But already in
Al-Hariri's day (nat. A.H. 446 = A.D. 1030) Baghdad had drawn off much
of its population.

[FN#381] This fumigation (Bukhúr) is still used. A little incense or
perfumed wood is burnt upon an open censor (Mibkharah) of earthenware
or metal, and passed round, each guest holding it for a few moments
under his beard. In the Somali Country, the very home of incense, both
sexes fumigate the whole person after carnal intercourse. Lane (Mod.
Egypt, chapt. viii) gives an illustration of the Mibkharah.

[FN#382] The reader of The Nights will remark that the merchant is
often a merchant-prince, consorting and mating with the highest
dignitaries. Even amongst the Romans, a race of soldiers, statesmen and
lawyers, "mercatura" on a large scale was "not to be vituperated." In
Boccacio (x. 19) they are netti e delicati uomini. England is perhaps
the only country which has made her fortune by trade, and much of it
illicit trade, like that in slaves which built Liverpool and Bristol,
and which yet disdains or affects to disdain the trader. But the
unworthy prejudice is disappearing with the last generation, and men
who formerly would have half starved as curates and ensigns, barristers
and carabins are now only too glad to become merchants.

[FN#383] These lines in the Calc. and Bul. Edits. Have already occurred
(Night vii.) but such carelessness is characteristic despite the
proverb, "In repetition is no fruition." I quote Torrens (p. 60) by way
of variety. As regards the anemone (here called a tulip) being named
"Shakík" = fissure, I would conjecture that it derives from the flower
often forming long lines of red like stripes of blood in the landscape.
Travellers in Syria always observe this.

[FN#384] Such an address to a royalty (Eastern) even in the present
day, would be a passport to future favours.

[FN#385] In England the man marries and the woman is married: there is
no such distinction in Arabia.

[FN#386] "Sultan" (and its corruption "Soldan") etymologically means
lord, victorious, ruler, ruling over. In Arabia it is a not uncommon
proper name; and as a title it is taken by a host of petty kinglets.
The Abbaside Caliphs (as Al-Wásik who has been noticed) formally
created these Sultans as their regents. Al-Tá'i bi'llah (regn. A.H. 363
= 974), invested the famous Sabuktagin with the office; and as
Alexander-Sikandar was wont to do, fashioned for him two flags, one of
silver, after the fashion of nobles, and the other of gold, as
Viceroy-designate. Sabuktagin's son, the famous Mahmúd of the
Ghaznavite dynasty in A.H. 393 = 1002, was the first to adopt "Sultan"
as an independent title some two hundred years after the death of Harun
al-Rashid. In old writers we have the Soldan of Egypt, the Soudan of
Persia, and the Sowdan of Babylon; three modifications of one word.

[FN#387] i.e. he was a "Háfiz," one who commits to memory the whole of
the Koran. It is a serious task and must be begun early. I learnt by
rote the last "Juzw" (or thirtieth part) and found that quite enough.
This is the vulgar use of "Hafiz": technically and theologically it
means the third order of Traditionists (the total being five) who know
by heart 300,000 traditions of the Prophet with their ascriptions. A
curious "spiritualist" book calls itself "Hafed, Prince of Persia,"
proving by the very title that the Spirits are equally ignorant of
Arabic and Persian.

[FN#388] Here again the Cairo Edit. repeats the six couplets already
given in Night xvii. I take them from Torrens (p. 163).

[FN#389] This naïve admiration of beauty in either sex characterised
our chivalrous times. Now it is mostly confined to "professional
beauties" or what is conventionally called the "fair sex"; as if there
could be any comparison between the beauty of man and the beauty of
woman, the Apollo Belvidere with the Venus de Medici.

[FN#390] Arab. "Shásh" (in Pers. urine) a light turband generally of
muslin.

[FN#391] This is a _lieu commun_ of Eastern worldly wisdom. Quite true!
Very unadvisable to dive below the surface of one's acquaintances, but
such intimacy is like marriage of which Johnson said, "Without it there
is no pleasure in life."

[FN#392] The lines are attributed to the famous Al-Mutanabbi = the
claimant to "Prophecy," of whom I have given a few details in my
Pilgrimage iii. 60, 62. He led the life of a true poet, somewhat
Chauvinistic withal; and, rather than run away, was killed in A.H. 354
= 965.

[FN#393] Arab. "Nabíz" = wine of raisins or dates; any fermented
liquor; from a root to "press out" in Syriac, like the word "Talmiz"
(or Tilmiz says the Kashf al-Ghurrah) a pupil, student. Date-wine
(fermented from the fruit, not the Tádi, or juice of the stem, our
"toddy") is called Fazikh. Hence the Masjid al-Fazikh at Al-Medinah
where the Ansar or Auxiliaries of that city were sitting cup in hand
when they heard of the revelation forbidding inebriants and poured the
liquor upon the ground (Pilgrimage ii. 322).

[FN#394] Arab. "Huda" = direction (to the right way), salvation, a word
occurring in the Opening Chapter of the Koran. Hence to a Kafir who
offers the Salam-salutation many Moslems reply "Allah-yahdík" = Allah
direct thee! (i.e. make thee a Moslem), instead of Allah yusallimak =
Allah lead thee to salvation. It is the root word of the Mahdi and
Mohdi.

[FN#395] These lines have already occurred in The First Kalandar's
Story (Night xi.) I quote by way of change and with permission Mr.
Payne's version (i. 93).

[FN#396] Arab. "Farajíyah," a long-sleeved robe worn by the learned
(Lane, M.E., chapt. i.).

[FN#397] Arab. "Sarráf" (vulg. Sayrafi), whence the Anglo-Indian
"Shroff," a familiar corruption.

[FN#398] Arab. "Yahúdi" which is less polite than "Banú Isráil" =
Children of Israel. So in Christendom "Israelite" when in favour and
"Jew" (with an adjective or a participle) when nothing is wanted of
him.

[FN#399] Also called "Ghilmán" = the beautiful youths appointed to
serve the True Believers in Paradise. The Koran says (chapt. lvi. 9
etc.) "Youths, which shall continue in their bloom for ever, shall go
round about to attend them, with goblets, and beakers, and a cup of
flowing wine," etc. Mohammed was an Arab (not a Persian, a born
pederast) and he was too fond of women to be charged with love of boys:
even Tristam Shandy (vol. vii. chapt. 7; "No, quoth a third; the
gentleman has been committing——") knew that the two tastes are
incompatibles. But this and other passages in the Koran have given the
Chevaliers de la Paille a hint that the use of boys, like that of wine,
here forbidden, will be permitted in Paradise.

[FN#400] Which, by the by, is the age of an oldish old maid in Egypt. I
much doubt puberty being there earlier than in England where our
grandmothers married at fourteen. But Orientals are aware that the
period of especial feminine devilry is between the first menstruation
and twenty when, according to some, every girl is a "possible
murderess." So they wisely marry her and get rid of what is called the
"lump of grief," the "domestic calamity"—a daughter. Amongst them we
never hear of the abominable egotism and cruelty of the English mother,
who disappoints her daughter's womanly cravings in order to keep her at
home for her own comfort; and an "old maid" in the house, especially a
stout, plump old maid, is considered not "respectable." The ancient
virgin is known by being lean and scraggy; and perhaps this diagnosis
is correct.

[FN#401] This prognostication of destiny by the stars and a host of
follies that end in -mancy is an intricate and extensive subject. Those
who would study it are referred to chapt. xiv. of the "Qanoon-e-Islam,
or the Customs of the Mussulmans of India; etc., etc., by Jaffur
Shurreeff and translated by G. A. Herklots, M. D. of Madras." This
excellent work first appeared in 1832 (Allen and Co., London) and thus
it showed the way to Lane's "Modern Egyptians" (1833-35). The name was
unfortunate as "Kuzzilbash" (which rhymed to guzzle and hash), and kept
the book back till a second edition appeared in 1863 (Madras: J.
Higginbotham).

[FN#402] Arab. "Bárid," lit. cold: metaph. vain, foolish, insipid.

[FN#403] Not to "spite thee" but "in spite of thee." The phrase is
still used by high and low.

[FN#404] Arab. "Ahdab," the common hunchback; in classical language the
Gobbo in the text would be termed "Ak'as" from "Ka'as," one with
protruding back and breast; sometimes used for hollow back and
protruding breast.

[FN#405] This is the custom with such gentry, who, when they see a
likely man sitting, are allowed by custom to ride astraddle upon his
knees with most suggestive movements, till he buys them off. These
Ghawázi are mostly Gypsies who pretend to be Moslems; and they have
been confused with the Almahs or Moslem dancing-girls proper (Awálim,
plur. of Alimah, a learned feminine) by a host of travellers. They call
themselves Barámikah or Barmecides only to affect Persian origin. Under
native rule they were perpetually being banished from and returning to
Cairo (Pilgrimage i., 202). Lane (M.E., chapts. xviii. and xix.)
discusses the subject, and would derive Al'mah, often so pronounced,
from Heb. Almah, girl, virgin, singing-girl, hence he would translate
Al-Alamoth shir (Psalm xlvi.) and Nebalim al-alamoth (I. Chron., xv.
20) by a "song for singing-girls" and "harps for singing-girls." He
quotes also St. Jerome as authority that Alma in Punic (Phoenician)
signified a virgin, not a common article, I may observe, amongst
singing-girls. I shall notice in a future page Burckhardt's description
of the Ghawazi, p. 173, "Arabic Proverbs;" etc., etc. Second Edition.
London: Quaritch, 1875.

[FN#406] I need hardly describe the tarbúsh, a corruption of the Per.
"Sar-púsh" (headcover) also called "Fez" from its old home; and
"tarbrush" by the travelling Briton. In old days it was a calotte worn
under the turban; and it was protected from scalp-perspiration by an
"Arakiyah" (Pers. Arak-chin) a white skull-cap. Now it is worn without
either and as a head-dress nothing can be worse (Pilgrimage ii. 275).

[FN#407] Arab. "Tár.": the custom still prevails. Lane (M.E., chapt.
xviii.) describes and figures this hoop-drum.

[FN#408] The couch on which she sits while being displayed. It is her
throne, for she is the Queen of the occasion, with all the Majesty of
Virginity.

[FN#409] This is a solemn "chaff;" such liberties being permitted at
weddings and festive occasions.

[FN#410] The pre-Islamític dynasty of Al-Yaman in Arabia Felix, a
region formerly famed for wealth and luxury. Hence the mention of
Yamani work. The caravans from Sana'á, the capital, used to carry
patterns of vases to be made in China and bring back the porcelains at
the end of the third year: these are the Arabic inscriptions which have
puzzled so many collectors. The Tobba, or Successors, were the old
Himyarite Kings, a dynastic name like Pharaoh, Kisra (Persia), Negush
(Abyssinia), Khakan or Khan (Tartary), etc., who claimed to have
extended their conquests to Samarcand and made war on China. Any
history of Arabia (as Crichton I., chapt. iv.) may be consulted for
their names and annals. I have been told by Arabs that "Tobba" (or
Tubba) is still used in the old Himyar-land = the Great or the Chief.

[FN#411] Lane and Payne (as well as the Bres. Edit.) both render the
word "to kiss her," but this would be clean contrary to Moslem usage.

[FN#412] i.e. he was full of rage which he concealed.

[FN#413] The Hindus (as the Katha shows) compare this swimming gait
with an elephant's roll.

[FN#414] Arab. "Fitnah," a word almost as troublesome as "Adab."
Primarily, revolt, seduction, mischief: then a beautiful girl (or boy),
and lastly a certain aphrodisiac perfume extracted from mimosa-flowers
(Pilgrimage i., 118).

[FN#415] Lit. burst the "gall-bladder:" In this and in the "liver"
allusions I dare not be baldly literal.

[FN#416] Arab. "Usfur" the seeds of Carthamus tinctorius = Safflower
(Forskal, Flora, etc. lv.). The seeds are crushed for oil and the
flowers, which must be gathered by virgins or the colour will fail, are
extensively used for dying in Southern Arabia and Eastern Africa.

[FN#417] On such occasions Miss Modesty shuts her eye and looks as if
about to faint.

[FN#418] After either evacuation the Moslem is bound to wash or sand
the part; first however he should apply three pebbles, or potsherds or
clods of earth. Hence the allusion in the Koran (chapt. ix), "men who
love to be purified." When the Prophet was questioning the men of Kuba,
where he founded a mosque (Pilgrimage ii., 215), he asked them about
their legal ablutions, especially after evacuation; and they told him
that they used three stones before washing. Moslems and Hindus (who
prefer water mixed with earth) abhor the unclean and unhealthy use of
paper without ablution; and the people of India call European
draught-houses, by way of opprobrium, "Kághaz-khánah" = paper closets.
Most old Anglo-Indians, however, learn to use water.

[FN#419] "Miao" or "Mau" is the generic name of the cat in the Egyptian
of the hieroglyphs.

[FN#420] Arab. "Ya Mash'úm" addressed to an evil spirit.

[FN#421] "Heehaw!" as we should say. The Bresl. Edit. makes the cat cry
"Nauh! Nauh!" and the ass-colt "Manu! Manu!" I leave these
onomatopoeics as they are in Arabic; they are curious, showing the
unity in variety of hearing inarticulate sounds. The bird which is
called "Whip poor Will" in the U.S. is known to the Brazilians as "Joam
corta páo" (John cut wood); so differently do they hear the same notes.

[FN#422] It is usually a slab of marble with a long slit in front and a
round hole behind. The text speaks of a Kursi (= stool); but this is
now unknown to native houses which have not adopted European fashions.

[FN#423] This again is chaff as she addresses the Hunchback. The Bul.
Edit. has "O Abu Shiháb" (Father of the shooting-star = evil spirit);
the Bresl. Edit. "O son of a heap! O son of a Something!" (al-afsh, a
vulgarism).

[FN#424] As the reader will see, Arab ideas of "fun" and practical
jokes are of the largest, putting the Hibernian to utter rout, and
comparing favourably with those recorded in Don Quixote.

[FN#425] Arab. "Saráwil" a corruption of the Pers. "Sharwál"; popularly
called "libás" which, however, may also mean clothing in general and
especially outer-clothing. I translate "bag-trousers" and
"petticoat-trousers," the latter being the divided skirt of our future.
In the East, where Common Sense, not Fashion, rules dress, men, who
have a protuberance to be concealed, wear petticoats and women wear
trousers. The feminine article is mostly baggy but sometimes, as in
India, collant-tight. A quasi-sacred part of it is the inkle, tape or
string, often a most magnificent affair, with tassels of pearl and
precious stones; and "laxity in the trouser-string" is equivalent to
the loosest conduct. Upon the subject of "libás," "sarwál" and its
variants the curious reader will consult Dr. Dozy's "Dictionnaire
Détaillé des Noms des Vêtements chez les Arabes," a most valuable work.

[FN#426] The turban out of respect is not put upon the ground (Lane, M.
E., chapt. i.).

[FN#427] Arab. "Madfa" showing the modern date or the modernization of
the tale. In Lebid "Madáfi" (plur. of Madfa') means water-courses or
leats.

[FN#428] In Arab. the "he" is a "she;" and Habíb ("friend") is the
Attic {Greek Letters}, a euphemism for lover. This will occur
throughout The Nights. So the Arabs use a phrase corresponding with the
Stoic {Greek Letters}, i.e. is wont, is fain.

[FN#429] Part of the Azán, or call to prayer.

[FN#430] Arab. "Shiháb," these meteors being the flying shafts shot at
evil spirits who approach too near heaven. The idea doubtless arose
from the showers of August and November meteors (The Perseides and
Taurides) which suggest a battle raging in upper air. Christendom also
has its superstition concerning these and called those of August the
"fiery tears of Saint Lawrence," whose festival was on August 10.

[FN#431] Arab. "Tákiyah" = Pers. Arak-chin; the calotte worn under the
Fez. It is, I have said, now obsolete and the red woollen cap (mostly
made in Europe) is worn over the hair; an unclean practice.

[FN#432] Often the effect of cold air after a heated room.

[FN#433] i.e. He was not a Eunuch, as the people guessed.

[FN#434] In Arab. "this night" for the reason before given.

[FN#435] Meaning especially the drink prepared of the young leaves and
florets of Cannabis Sativa. The word literally means "day grass" or
"herbage." This intoxicant was much used by magicians to produce
ecstasy and thus to "deify themselves and receive the homage of the
genii and spirits of nature."

[FN#436] Torrens, being an Irishman, translates "and woke in the
morning sleeping at Damascus."

[FN#437] Arab. "Labbayka," the cry technically called "Talbiyah" and
used by those entering Meccah (Pilgrimage iii. 125-232). I shall also
translate it by "Adsum." The full cry is:—

     Here am I, O Allah, here am I!
     No partner hast Thou, here am I:
     Verily the praise and the grace and the kingdom are thine:
     No partner hast Thou: here am I!

A single Talbiyah is a "Shart" or positive condition: and its
repetition is a Sunnat or Custom of the Prophet. See Night xci.

[FN#438] The staple abuse of the vulgar is cursing parents and
relatives, especially feminine, with specific allusions to their
"shame." And when dames of high degree are angry, Nature, in the East
as in the West, sometimes speaks out clearly enough, despite Mistress
Chapone and all artificial restrictions.

[FN#439] A great beauty in Arabia and the reverse in Denmark, Germany
and Slav-land, where it is a sign of being a were-wolf or a vampire. In
Greece also it denotes a "Brukolak" or vampire.

[FN#440] This is not physiologically true: a bride rarely conceives the
first night, and certainly would not know that she had conceived.
Moreover the number of courses furnished by the bridegroom would be
against conception. It is popularly said that a young couple often
undoes in the morning what it has done during the night.

[FN#441] Torrens (Notes, xxiv.) quotes "Fleisher" upon the word
"Ghamghama" (Diss. Crit. De Glossis Habichtionis), which he compares
with "Dumduma" and Humbuma," determining them to be onomatopoeics, "an
incomplete and an obscure murmur of a sentence as it were lingering
between the teeth and lips and therefore difficult to be understood."
Of this family is "Taghúm"; not used in modern days. In my Pilgrimage
(i. 313) I have noticed another, "Khyas', Khyas'!" occurring in a Hizb
al-Bahr (Spell of the Sea). Herklots gives a host of them; and their
sole characteristics are harshness and strangeness of sound, uniting
consonants which are not joined in Arabic. The old Egyptians and
Chaldeans had many such words composed at will for theurgic operations.

[FN#442] This may mean either "it is of Mosul fashion" or, it is of
muslin.

[FN#443] To the English reader these lines would appear the reverse of
apposite; but Orientals have their own ways of application, and all
allusions to Badawi partings are effective and affecting. The civilised
poets of Arab cities throw the charm of the Desert over their verse by
images borrowed from its scenery, the dromedary, the mirage and the
well as naturally as certain of our bards who hated the country,
babbled of purling rills, etc. thoroughly to feel Arabic poetry one
must know the Desert (Pilgrimage iii., 63).

[FN#444] In those days the Arabs and the Portuguese recorded everything
which struck them, as the Chinese and Japanese in our times. And yet we
complain of the amount of our modern writing!

[FN#445] This is mentioned because it is the act preliminary to naming
the babe.

[FN#446] Arab. "Kahramánát" from Kahramán, an old Persian hero who
conversed with the Simurgh-Griffon. Usually the word is applied to
women-at-arms who defend the Harem, like the Urdu-begani of India,
whose services were lately offered to England (1885), or the "Amazons"
of Dahome.

[FN#447] Meaning he grew as fast in one day as other children in a
month.

[FN#448] Arab. Al-Aríf; the tutor, the assistant-master.

[FN#449] Arab. "Ibn harám," a common term of abuse; and not a factual
reflection on the parent. I have heard a mother apply the term to her
own son.

[FN#450] Arab. "Khanjar" from the Persian, a syn. with the Arab.
"Jambiyah." It is noticed in my Pilgrimage iii., pp. 72,75. To "silver
the dagger" means to become a rich man. From "Khanjar," not from its
fringed loop or strap, I derive our silly word "hanger." Dr. Steingass
would connect it with Germ. Fänger, e.g. Hirschfänger.

[FN#451] Again we have "Dastur" for Izn."

[FN#452] Arab. "Iklím"; the seven climates of Ptolemy.

[FN#453] Arab. "Al-Ghadir," lit. a place where water sinks, a lowland:
here the drainage-lakes east of Damascus into which the Baradah
(Abana?) discharges. The higher eastern plain is "Al-Ghutah" before
noticed.

[FN#454] The "Plain of Pebbles" still so termed at Damascus; an open
space west of the city.

[FN#455] Every Guide-book, even the Reverend Porter's "Murray," gives a
long account of this Christian Church 'verted to a Mosque.

[FN#456] Arab. "Nabút"; Pilgrimage i. 336.

[FN#457] The Bres. Edit. says, "would have knocked him into Al-Yaman,"
(Southern Arabia), something like our slang phrase "into the middle of
next week."

[FN#458] Arab. "Khádim": lit. a servant, politely applied (like Aghá =
master) to a castrato. These gentry wax furious if baldly called
"Tawáshi" = Eunuch. A mauvais plaisant in Egypt used to call me The
Agha because a friend had placed his wife under my charge.

[FN#459] This sounds absurd enough in English, but Easterns always put
themselves first for respect.

[FN#460] In Arabic the World is feminine.

[FN#461] Arab. "Sáhib" = lit. a companion; also a friend and especially
applied to the Companions of Mohammed. Hence the Sunnis claim for them
the honour of "friendship" with the Apostle; but the Shia'hs reply that
the Arab says "Sahaba-hu'l-himár" (the Ass was his Sahib or companion).
In the text it is a Wazirial title, in modern India it is = gentleman,
e.g. "Sahib log" (the Sahib people) means their white conquerors, who,
by the by, mostly mispronounce the word "Sáb."

[FN#462] Arab. "Suwán," prop. Syenite, from Syene (Al-Suwan) but
applied to flint and any hard stone.

[FN#463] It was famous in the middle ages, and even now it is, perhaps,
the most interesting to travellers after that "Sentina Gentium," the
"Bhendi Bazar" of unromantic Bombay.

[FN#464] "The Gate of the Gardens," in the northern wall, a Roman
archway of the usual solid construction shaming not only our modern
shams, but our finest masonry.

[FN#465] Arab. "Al-Asr," which may mean either the hour or the prayer.
It is also the moment at which the Guardian Angels relieve each other
(Sale's Koran, chapt. v.).

[FN#466] Arab. "Ya házá" = O this (one)! a somewhat slighting address
equivalent to "Heus tu! O thou, whoever thou art." Another form is "Yá
hú" = O he! Can this have originated Swift's "Yahoo"?

[FN#467] Alluding to the τήρατα ("minor miracles which cause surprise")
performed by Saints' tombs, the mildest form of thaumaturgy. One of
them gravely recorded in the Dabistan (ii. 226) is that of the holy
Jamen, who opened the Sámran or bead- bracelet from the arm of the
beautiful Chistápá with member erect, "thus evincing his manly strength
and his command over himself"(!)

[FN#468] The River of Paradise, a lieu commun of poets (Koran, chapt.
cviii.): the water is whiter than milk or silver, sweeter than honey,
smoother than cream, more odorous than musk; its banks are of
chrysolite and it is drunk out of silver cups set around it thick as
stars. Two pipes conduct it to the Prophet's Pond which is an exact
square, one month's journey in compass. Kausar is spirituous like wine;
Salsabil sweet like clarified honey; the Fount of Mildness is like milk
and the Fount of Mercy like liquid crystal.

[FN#469] The Moslem does not use the European basin because water which
has touched an impure skin becomes impure. Hence it is poured out from
a ewer ("ibrík" Pers. Abríz) upon the hands and falls into a basin
("tisht") with an open-worked cover.

[FN#470] Arab. "Wahsh," a word of many meanings; nasty, insipid,
savage, etc. The offside of a horse is called Wahshi opposed to Insi,
the near side. The Amir Taymur ("Lord Iron") whom Europeans unwittingly
call after his Persian enemies' nickname, "Tamerlane," i.e.
Taymur-I-lang, or limping Taymur, is still known as "Al-Wahsh" (the
wild beast) at Damascus, where his Tartars used to bury men up to their
necks and play at bowls with their heads for ninepins.

[FN#471] For "grandson" as being more affectionate. Easterns have not
yet learned that clever Western saying:—The enemies of our enemies are
our friends.

[FN#472] This was a simple bastinado on the back, not the more
ceremonious affair of beating the feet-soles. But it is surprising what
the Egyptians can bear; some of the rods used in the time of the
Mameluke Beys are nearly as thick as a man's wrist.

[FN#473] The woman-like spite of the eunuch intended to hurt the
grandmother's feelings.

[FN#474] The usual Cairene "chaff."

[FN#475] A necessary precaution against poison (Pilgrimage i. 84, and
iii. 43).

[FN#476] The Bresl. Edit. (ii. 108) describes the scene at greater
length.

[FN#477] The Bul. Edit. gives by mistake of diacritical points,
"Zabdaniyah:" Raydaniyah is or rather was a camping ground to the North
of Cairo.

[FN#478] Arab. "La'abat" = a plaything, a puppet, a lay figure. Lane
(i. 326) conjectures that the cross is so called because it resembles a
man with arms extended. But Moslems never heard of the fanciful ideas
of mediæval Christian divines who saw the cross everywhere and in
everything. The former hold that Pharaoh invented the painful and
ignominious punishment. (Koran, chapt. vii.).

[FN#479] Here good blood, driven to bay, speaks out boldly. But, as a
rule, the humblest and mildest Eastern when in despair turns round upon
his oppressors like a wild cat. Some of the criminals whom Fath Ali
Shah of Persia put to death by chopping down the fork, beginning at the
scrotum, abused his mother till the knife reached their vitals and they
could no longer speak.

[FN#480] These repeated "laughs" prove the trouble of his spirit. Noble
Arabs "show their back-teeth" so rarely that their laughter is held
worthy of being recorded by their biographers.

[FN#481] A popular phrase, derived from the Koranic "Truth is come, and
falsehood is vanished: for falsehood is of short continuance" (chapt.
xvii.). It is an equivalent of our adaptation from 1 Esdras iv. 41,
"Magna est veritas et prævalebit." But the great question still
remains, What is Truth?

[FN#482] In Night lxxv. these lines will occur with variants.

[FN#483] This is always mentioned: the nearer seat the higher the
honour.

[FN#484] Alluding to the phrase "Al-safar zafar" = voyaging is victory
(Pilgrimage i., 127).

[FN#485] Arab. "Habb;" alluding to the black drop in the human heart
which the Archangel Gabriel removed from Mohammed by opening his
breast.

[FN#486] This phrase, I have said, often occurs: it alludes to the
horripilation (Arab. Kush'arírah), horror or gooseflesh which, in Arab
as in Hindu fables, is a symptom of great joy. So Boccaccio's "pelo
arriciato" v., 8: Germ. Gänsehaut.

[FN#487] Arab. "Hasanta ya Hasan" = Bene detto, Benedetto! the usual
word-play vulgarly called "pun": Hasan (not Hassan, as we will write
it) meaning "beautiful."

[FN#488] Arab. "Loghah" also = a vocabulary, a dictionary; the Arabs
had them by camel-loads.

[FN#489] The seventh of the sixteen "Bahr" (metres) in Arabic prosody;
the easiest because allowing the most license and, consequently, a
favourite for didactic, homiletic and gnomic themes. It means literally
"agitated" and was originally applied to the rude song of the Cameleer.
De Sacy calls this doggrel "the poet's ass" (Torrens, Notes xxvi.). It
was the only metre in which Mohammed the Apostle ever spoke: he was no
poet (Koran xxxvi., 69) but he occasionally recited a verse and recited
it wrongly (Dabistan iii., 212). In Persian prosody Rajaz is the
seventh of nineteen and has six distinct varieties (pp. 79-81),
"Gladwin's Dissertations on Rhetoric," etc. Calcutta, 1801). I shall
have more to say about it in the Terminal Essay.

[FN#490] "Her stature tall—I hate a dumpy woman" (Don Juan).

[FN#491] A worthy who was Kazi of Kufah (Cufa) in the seventh century.
Al-Najaf, generally entitled "Najaf al-Ashraf" (the Venerand) is the
place where Ali, the son-in-law of Mohammed, lies or is supposed to lie
buried, and has ever been a holy place to the Shi'ahs. I am not certain
whether to translate "Sa'alab" by fox or jackal; the Arabs make scant
distinction between them. "Abu Hosayn" (Father of the Fortlet) is
certainly the fox, and as certainly "Sha'arhar" is the jackal from the
Pehlevi Shagál or Shaghál.

[FN#492] Usually by all manner of extortions and robbery, corruption
and bribery, the ruler's motto being

Fiat injustitia ruat Coelum.

There is no more honest man than the Turkish peasant or the private
soldier; but the process of deterioration begins when he is made a
corporal and culminates in the Pasha. Moreover official dishonesty is
permitted by public opinion, because it belongs to the condition of
society. A man buys a place (as in England two centuries ago) and
retains it by presents to the heads of offices. Consequently he must
recoup himself in some way, and he mostly does so by grinding the faces
of the poor and by spoiling the widow and the orphan. The radical cure
is high pay; but that phase of society refuses to afford it.

[FN#493] Arab. "Malik" (King) and "Malak" (angel) the words being
written the same when lacking vowels and justifying the jingle.

[FN #494] Arab. "Hurr"; the Latin "ingenuus," lit. freeborn; metaph.
noble as opp. to a slave who is not expected to do great or good deeds.
In pop. use it corresponds, like "Fatá," with our "gentleman."

[FN#495] This is one of the best tales for humour and movement, and
Douce and Madden show what a rich crop of fabliaux, whose leading
incident was the disposal of a dead body, it produced.

[FN#496] Other editions read, "at Bassorah" and the Bresl. (ii. 123)
"at Bassorah and Kájkár" (Káshghár): somewhat like in Dover and
Sebastopol. I prefer China because further off and making the
improbabilities more notable.

[FN#497] Arab. "Judri," lit. "small stones" from the hard gravelly
feeling of the pustules (Rodwell, p. 20). The disease is generally
supposed to be the growth of Central Africa where it is still a plague
and passed over to Arabia about the birth-time of Mohammed. Thus is
usually explained the "war of the elephant" (Koran, chapt. cv.) when
the Abyssinian army of Abrahah, the Christian, was destroyed by
swallows (Abábíl which Major Price makes the plural of Abilah = a
vesicle) which dropped upon them "stones of baked clay," like vetches
(Pilgrimage ii. 175). See for details Sale (in loco) who seems to
accept the miraculous defence of the Ka'abah. For the horrors of
small-pox in Central Intertropical Africa the inoculation, known also
to the Badawin of Al-Hijáz and other details, readers will consult "The
Lake Regions of Central Africa" (ii. 318). The Hindus "take the bull by
the horns" and boldly make "Sítlá" (small-pox) a goddess, an
incarnation of Bhawáni, deëss of destruction-reproduction. In China
small-pox is believed to date from B.C. 1200; but the chronology of the
Middle Kingdom still awaits the sceptic.

[FN#498] In Europe we should add "and all fled, especially the women."
But the fatalism inherent in the Eastern mind makes the great
difference.

[FN#499] Arab. "Uzayr." Esdras was a manner of Ripp van Winkle. He was
riding over the ruins of Jerusalem when it had been destroyed by the
Chaldeans and he doubted by what means Allah would restore it;
whereupon he died and at the end of a hundred years he revived. He
found his basket of figs and cruse of wine as they were; but of his ass
only the bones remained. These were raised to life as Ezra looked on
and the ass began at once to bray. Which was a lesson to Esdras.
(Koran, chapt. ii.) The oath by the ass's hoofs is to ridicule the Jew.
Mohammed seems to have had an idée fixe that "the Jews say, Ezra is the
son of God" (Koran ix.); it may have arisen from the heterodox Jewish
belief that Ezra, when the Law was utterly lost, dictated the whole
anew to the scribes of his own memory. His tomb with the huge green
dome is still visited by the Jews of Baghdad.

[FN#500] Arab. "Bádhanj," the Pers. Bád. (wind) -gír (catcher): a
wooden pent-house on the terrace-roof universal in the nearer East.

[FN#501] The hunchback, in Arabia as in Southern Europe, is looked upon
by the vulgar with fear and aversion. The reason is that he is usually
sharper-witted than his neighbours.

[FN#502]Arab. "Yá Sattár" = Thou who veilest the discreditable secrets
of Thy creatures.

[FN#503] Arab. "Nasráni," a follower of Him of Nazareth and an older
name than "Christian" which (Acts xi., 26) was first given at Antioch
about A.D. 43. The cry in Alexandria used to be "Ya Nasráni, Kalb
awáni!"=O Nazarene! O dog obscene! (Pilgrimage i., 160).). "Christian"
in Arabic can be expressed only by "Masíhi" = follower of the Messiah.

[FN#504] Arab. "Tasbíh," = Saluting in the Subh (morning).

[FN#505] In the East women stand on minor occasions while men squat on
their hunkers in a way hardly possible to an untrained European. The
custom is old. Herodotus (ii., 35) says, "The women stand up when they
make water, but the men sit down." Will it be believed that Canon
Rawlinson was too modest to leave this passage in his translation? The
custom was perpetuated by Al-Islam because the position prevents the
ejection touching the clothes and making them ceremonially impure;
possibly they borrowed it from the Guebres. Dabistan, Gate xvi. says,
"It is improper, whilst in an erect posture, to make water, it is
therefore necessary to sit at squat and force it to some distance,
repeating the Avesta mentally."

[FN#506] This is still a popular form of the "Kinchin lay," and as the
turbands are often of fine stuff, the petite industrie pays well.

[FN#507]Arab. "Wali" = Governor; the term still in use for the Governor
General of a Province as opposed to the "Muháfiz," or
district-governor. In Eastern Arabia the Wali is the Civil Governor
opposed to the Amir or Military Commandant. Under the Caliphate the
Wali acted also as Prefect of Police (the Indian Faujdár), who is now
called "Zábit." The older name for the latter was "Sáhib al-Shartah" (=
chief of the watch) or "Mutawalli"; and it was his duty to go the
rounds in person. The old "Charley," with his lantern and cudgel, still
guards the bazars in Damascus.

[FN#508] Arab. "Al-Mashá ilí" = the bearer of a cresset (Mash'al) who
was also Jack Ketch. In Anglo-India the name is given to a lower
body-servant. The "Mash'al" which Lane (M. E., chapt. vi.) calls
"Mesh'al" and illustrates, must not be confounded with its congener the
"Sha'ilah" or link (also lamp, wick, etc.).

[FN#509] I need hardly say that the civilised "drop" is unknown to the
East where men are strung up as to a yardarm. This greatly prolongs the
suffering.

[FN#510] Arab. "Lukmah"; = a mouthful. It is still the fashion amongst
Easterns of primitive manners to take up a handful of rice, etc., ball
it and put it into a friend's mouth honoris causâ. When the friend is a
European the expression of his face is generally a study.

[FN#511] I need hardly note that this is an old Biblical practice. The
ass is used for city-work as the horse for fighting and travelling, the
mule for burdens and the dromedary for the desert. But the Badawi, like
the Indian, despises the monture and sings:—

     The back of the steed is a noble place
     But the mule's dishonour, the ass disgrace!

The fine white asses, often thirteen hands high, sold by the Banu Salíb
and other Badawi tribes, will fetch £100, and more. I rode a little
brute from Meccah to Jedda (42 miles) in one night and it came in with
me cantering.

[FN#512] A dry measure of about five bushels (Cairo). The classical
pronunciation is Irdabb and it measured 24 sa'a (gallons) each filling
four outstretched hands.

[FN#513] "Al-Jawáli" should be Al-Jáwali (Al-Makrizi) and the Bab
al-Nasr (Gate of Victory) is that leading to Suez. I lived in that
quarter as shown by my Pilgrimage (i. 62).

[FN#514] Arab. "Al-'ajalah," referring to a saying in every Moslem
mouth, "Patience is from the Protector (Allah): Hurry is from Hell."
That and "Inshallah bukra!" (Please God tomorrow.) are the traveller's
bêtes noires.

[FN#515] Here it is a polite equivalent for "fall to!"

[FN#516] The left hand is used throughout the East for purposes of
ablution and is considered unclean. To offer the left hand would be
most insulting and no man ever strokes his beard with it or eats with
it: hence, probably, one never sees a left handed man throughout the
Moslem east. In the Brazil for the same reason old-fashioned people
will not take snuff with the right hand. And it is related of the
Khataians that they prefer the left hand, "Because the heart, which is
the Sultan of the city of the Body, hath his mansion on that side"
(Rauzat al-Safá).

[FN#517] Two feminine names as we might say Mary and Martha.

[FN#518] It was near the Caliph's two Palaces (Al Kasrayn); and was
famous in the 15th century A. D. The Kazi's Mahkamah (Court house) now
occupies the place of the Two Palaces

[FN#519] A Kaysariah is a superior kind of bazar, a "bezestein." That
in the text stood to the east of the principal street in Cairo and was
built in A. H. 502 (=1108-9) by a Circassian Emir, known as Fakhr
al-Din Jahárkas, a corruption of the Persian "Chehárkas" = four persons
(Lane, i. 422, from Al-Makrizi and Ibn Khallikan). For Jahárkas the
Mac. Edit. has Jirjís (George) a common Christian name. I once lodged
in a 'Wakálah (the modern Khan) Jirjis." Pilgrimage, i. 255.

[FN#520]Arab. "Second Day," i.e. after Saturday, the true Sabbath, so
marvellously ignored by Christendom.

[FN#521] Readers who wish to know how a traveller is lodged in a
Wakálah, Khan, or Caravanserai, will consult my Pilgrimage, i. 60.

[FN#522] The original occupation of the family had given it a name, as
amongst us.

[FN#523] The usual "chaff" or banter allowed even to modest women when
shopping, and—many a true word is spoken in jest.

[FN#524] "La adamnák" = Heaven deprive us not of thee, i.e. grant I see
thee often!

[FN#525] This is a somewhat cavalier style of advance; but Easterns
under such circumstances go straight to the point, hating to filer the
parfait amour.

[FN#526] The peremptory formula of a slave delivering such a message.

[FN#527] This would be our Thursday night, preceding the day of public
prayers which can be performed only when in a state of ceremonial
purity. Hence many Moslems go to the Hammam on Thursday and have no
connection with their wives till Friday night.

[FN#528] Lane (i. 423) gives ample details concerning the Habbániyah,
or grain-sellers' quarter in the southern part of Cairo; and shows that
when this tale was written (or transcribed?) the city was almost as
extensive as it is now.

[FN#529] Nakíb is a caravan-leader, a chief, a syndic; and "Abú
Shámah"= Father of a cheek mole, while "Abú Shámmah" = Father of a
smeller, a nose, a snout. The "Kuniyah," bye-name, patronymic or
matronymic, is necessary amongst Moslems whose list of names, all
connected more or less with religion, is so scanty. Hence Buckingham
the traveller was known as Abu Kidr, the Father of a Cooking-pot and
Hajj Abdullah as Abu Shawárib, Father of Mustachios (Pilgrimage, iii.,
263).

[FN#530] More correctly Bab Zawilah from the name of a tribe in
Northern Africa. This gate dates from the same age as the Eastern or
Desert gate, Bab al-Nasr (A.D. 1087) and is still much admired. M.
Jomard describes it (Description, etc., ii. 670) and lately my good
friend Yacoub Artin Pasha has drawn attention to it in the Bulletin de
l'Inst. Egypt., Deuxième Série, No. 4, 1883.

[FN#531] This ornament is still seen in the older saloons of Damascus:
the inscriptions are usually religious sentences, extracts from the
Koran, etc., in uncial characters. They take the place of our frescos;
and, as a work of art, are generally far superior.

[FN#532] Arab. "Bayáz al-Sultání," the best kind of gypsum which shines
like polished marble. The stucco on the walls of Alexandria, built by
Alexander of the two Horns, was so exquisitely tempered and beautifully
polished that men had to wear masks for fear of blindness.

[FN#533] This Iklíl, a complicated affair, is now obsolete, its place
having been taken by the "Kurs," a gold plate, some five inches in
diameter, set with jewels, etc. Lane (M. E. Appendix A) figures it.

[FN#534] The woman-artist who applies the dye is called "Munakkishah."

[FN#535] "Kissing with th' inner lip," as Shakespeare calls it; the
French _langue fourrée:_ and Sanskrit "Samputa." The subject of kissing
is extensive in the East. Ten different varieties are duly enumerated
in the "Ananga-Ranga;" or, The Hindu Art of Love (Ars Amoris Indica)
translated from the Sanskrit, and annotated by A. F. F. and B. F. R It
is also connected with unguiculation, or impressing the nails, of which
there are seven kinds; morsication (seven kinds); handling the hair and
tappings or pattings with the fingers and palm (eight kinds).

[FN#536] Arab. "asal-nahl," to distinguish it from "honey" i.e. syrup
of sugar-cane and fruits

[FN#537] The lines have occurred in Night xii. By way of variety I give
Torrens' version p. 273.

[FN#538] The way of carrying money in the corner of a
pocket-handkerchief is still common.

[FN#539] He sent the provisions not to be under an obligation to her in
this matter. And she received them to judge thereby of his liberality

[FN#540] Those who have seen the process of wine-making in the Libanus
will readily understand why it is always strained.

[FN#541] Arab. "Kulkasá," a kind of arum or yam, eaten boiled like our
potatoes.

[FN#542]At first he slipped the money into the bed-clothes: now he
gives it openly and she accepts it for a reason.

[FN#543] Arab. Al-Zalamah lit. = tyrants, oppressors, applied to the
police and generally to employés of Government. It is a word which
tells a history.

[FN#544] Moslem law is never completely satisfied till the criminal
confess. It also utterly ignores circumstantial evidence and for the
best of reasons: amongst so sharp-witted a people the admission would
lead to endless abuses. I greatly surprised a certain Governor-General
of India by giving him this simple information

[FN#545] Cutting off the right hand is the Koranic punishment (chapt.
v.) for one who robs an article worth four dinars, about forty francs
to shillings. The left foot is to be cut off at the ankle for a second
offence and so on; but death is reserved for a hardened criminal. The
practice is now obsolete and theft is punished by the bastinado, fine
or imprisonment. The old Guebres were as severe. For stealing one
dirham's worth they took a fine of two, cut off the ear-lobes, gave ten
stick-blows and dismissed the criminal who had been subjected to an
hour's imprisonment. A second theft caused the penalties to be doubled;
and after that the right hand was cut off or death was inflicted
according to the proportion stolen.

[FN#546] Koran viii. 17.

[FN#547] A universal custom in the East, the object being originally to
show that the draught was not poisoned.

[FN#548] Out of paste or pudding.

[FN#549] Boils and pimples are supposed to be caused by broken
hair-roots and in Hindostani are called Bál-tor.

[FN#550] He intended to bury it decently, a respect which Moslems
always show even to the exuviæ of the body, as hair and nail parings.
Amongst Guebres the latter were collected and carried to some mountain.
The practice was intensified by fear of demons or wizards getting
possession of the spoils.

[FN#551] Without which the marriage was not valid. The minimum is ten
dirhams (drachmas) now valued at about five francs to shillings; and if
a man marry without naming the sum, the woman, after consummation, can
compel him to pay this minimum.

[FN#552] Arab. "Khatmah" = reading or reciting the whole Koran, by one
or more persons, usually in the house, not over the tomb. Like the
"Zikr," Litany or Rogation, it is a pious act confined to certain
occasions.

[FN#553] Arab. "Zirbájah" = meat dressed with vinegar, cumin-seed
(Pers. Zír) and hot spices. More of it in the sequel of the tale.

[FN#554] A saying not uncommon meaning, let each man do as he seems
fit; also = "age quad agis": and at times corresponding with our saw
about the cap fitting.

[FN#555] Arab. "Su'úd," an Alpinia with pungent rhizome like ginger;
here used as a counter-odour.

[FN#556] Arab. "Tá'ih" = lost in the "Tíh," a desert wherein man may
lose himself, translated in our maps 'The Desert of the Wanderings,"
scil. of the children of Israel. "Credat Judæus."

[FN#557] _i.e._ £125 and £500.

[FN#558] A large sum was weighed by a professional instead of being
counted, the reason being that the coin is mostly old and worn: hence
our words "pound" and "pension" (or what is weighed out).

[FN#559] The eunuch is the best possible go-between on account of his
almost unlimited power over the Harem.

[FN#560] i.e., a slave-girl brought up in the house and never sold
except for some especial reason, as habitual drunkenness, etc.

[FN#561] Smuggling men into the Harem is a stock "topic" of eastern
tales. "By means of their female attendants, the ladies of the royal
harem generally get men into their apartments in the disguise of
women," says Vatsyayana in The Kama Sutra, Part V. London: Printed for
the Hindoo Kamashastra Society. 1883. For private circulation only.

[FN#562] These tears are shed over past separation. So the "Indians" of
the New World never meet after long parting without beweeping mutual
friends they have lost.

[FN#563] A most important Jack in office whom one can see with his
smooth chin and blubber lips, starting up from his lazy snooze in the
shade and delivering his orders more peremptorily than any Dogberry.
These epicenes are as curious and exceptional in character as in
external conformation. Disconnected, after a fashion, with humanity,
they are brave, fierce and capable of any villany or barbarity (as Agha
Mohammed Khan in Persia 1795-98). The frame is unnaturally long and
lean, especially the arms and legs; with high, flat, thin shoulders,
big protruding joints and a face by contrast extraordinarily large, a
veritable mask; the Castrato is expert in the use of weapons and sits
his horse admirably, riding well "home" in the saddle for the best of
reasons; and his hoarse, thick voice, which apparently does not break,
as in the European "Cáppone," invests him with all the circumstance of
command.

[FN#564] From the Meccan well used by Moslems much like Eau de Lourdes
by Christians: the water is saltish, hence the touch of Arab humour
(Pilgrimage iii., 201-202).

[FN#565] Such articles would be sacred from Moslem eyes.

[FN#566] Physiologically true, but not generally mentioned in
describing the emotions.

[FN#567] Properly "Uta," the different rooms, each "Odalisque," or
concubine, having her own.

[FN#568] Showing that her monthly ailment was over.

[FN#569] Arab "Muhammarah" = either browned before the fire or
artificially reddened.

[FN#570] The insolence and licence of these palace-girls was (and is)
unlimited, especially when, as in the present case, they have to deal
with a "softy." On this subject numberless stories are current
throughout the East.

[FN#571] i.e., blackened by the fires of Jehannam.

[FN#572] Arab. "Bi'l-Salámah" = in safety (to avert the evil eye). When
visiting the sick it is usual to say something civil; "The Lord heal
thee! No evil befall thee!" etc.

[FN#573] Washing during sickness is held dangerous by Arabs; and "going
to the Hammam" is, I have said, equivalent to convalescence.

[FN#574] Arab. "Máristán" (pronounced Múristan) a corruption of the
Pers. "Bímáristán" = place of sickness, a hospital much affected by the
old Guebres (Dabistan, i., 165, 166). That of Damascus was the first
Moslem hospital, founded by Al-Walid Son of Abd al-Malik the Ommiade in
A. H. 88 = 706-7. Benjamin of Tudela (A. D. 1164) calls it "Dar-al
Maraphtan" which his latest Editor explains by "Dar-al-Morabittan"
(abode of those who require being chained). Al-Makrizi (Khitat)
ascribes the invention of "Spitals" to Hippocrates; another historian
to an early Pharaoh "Manákiyush;" thus ignoring the Persian Kings,
Saint Ephrem (or Ephraim), Syru, etc. In modern parlance "Maristan" is
a madhouse where the maniacs are treated with all the horrors which
were universal in Europe till within a few years and of which
occasional traces occur to this day. In A.D. 1399 Katherine de la Court
held a "hospital in the Court called Robert de Paris," but the first
madhouse in Christendom was built by the legate Ortiz in Toledo A. D.
1483, and was therefore called Casa del Nuncio. The Damascus "Maristan"
was described by every traveller of the last century: and it showed a
curious contrast between the treatment of the maniac and the idiot or
omadhaun, who is humanely allowed to wander about unharmed, if not held
a Saint. When I saw it last (1870) it was all but empty and mostly in
ruins. As far as my experience goes, the United States is the only
country where the insane are rationally treated by the sane.

[FN#575] Hence the trite saying "Whoso drinks the water of the Nile
will ever long to drink it again." "Light" means easily digested water;
and the great test is being able to drink it at night between the
sleeps, without indigestion

[FN#576] "Níl" in popular parlance is the Nile in flood; although also
used for the River as a proper name. Egyptians (modern as well as
ancient) have three seasons, Al-Shitá (winter), Al-Sayf (summer) and
Al-Níl (the Nile i.e. flood season' our mid-summer); corresponding with
the Growth months; Housing (or granary)-months and Flood-months of the
older race.

[FN#577] These lines are in the Mac. Edit.

[FN#578] Arab. "Birkat al-Habash," a tank formerly existing in Southern
Cairo: Galland (Night 128) says "en remontant vers l'Ethiopie."

[FN#579] The Bres. Edit. (ii., 190), from which I borrow this
description, here alludes to the well-known Island, Al-Rauzah (Rodah) =
The Garden.

[FN#580] Arab. "Laylat al-Wafá," the night of the completion or
abundance of the Nile (-flood), usually between August 6th and 16th,
when the government proclaims that the Nilometer shows a rise of 16
cubits. Of course it is a great festival and a high ceremony, for Egypt
is still the gift of the Nile (Lane M. E. chapt. xxvi—a work which
would be much improved by a better index).

[FN#581] i.e., admiration will be complete.

[FN#582] Arab. "Sáhil Masr" (Misr): hence I suppose Galland's villes
maritimes.

[FN#583] A favourite simile, suggested by the broken glitter and
shimmer of the stream under the level rays and the breeze of eventide.

[FN#584] Arab. "Halab," derived by Moslems from "He (Abraham) milked
(halaba) the white and dun cow." But the name of the city occurs in the
Cuneiforms as Halbun or Khalbun, and the classics knew it as {Greek
Letters}, Beroca, written with variants.

[FN#585] Arab. "Ká'ah," usually a saloon; but also applied to a fine
house here and elsewhere in The Nights.

[FN#586] Arab. "Ghamz" = winking, signing with the eye which, amongst
Moslems, is not held "vulgar."

[FN#587] Arab. "Kamís" from low Lat. "Camicia," first found in St.
Jerome:— "Solent militantes habere lineas, quas Camicias vocant." Our
shirt, chemise, chemisette, etc., was unknown to the Ancients of
Europe.

[FN#588] Arab. "Narjís." The Arabs borrowed nothing, but the Persians
much, from Greek Mythology. Hence the eye of Narcissus, an idea hardly
suggested by the look of the daffodil (or asphodel)-flower, is at times
the glance of a spy and at times the die-away look of a mistress. Some
scholars explain it by the form of the flower, the internal calyx
resembling the iris, and the stalk being bent just below the petals
suggesting drooping eyelids and languid eyes. Hence a poet addresses
the Narcissus:—

O Narjis, look away! Before those eyes * I may not kiss her as a-breast
she lies.
What! Shall the lover close his eyes in sleep * While thine watch all
things between earth and skies?


The fashionable lover in the East must affect a frantic jealousy if he
does not feel it.

[FN#589] In Egypt there are neither bedsteads nor bedrooms: the carpets
and mattresses, pillows and cushions (sheets being unknown), are spread
out when wanted, and during the day are put into chests or cupboards,
or only rolled up in a corner of the room (Pilgrimage i. 53).

[FN#590] The women of Damascus have always been famed for the
sanguinary jealousy with which European story-books and novels credit
the "Spanish lady." The men were as celebrated for intolerance and
fanaticism, which we first read of in the days of Bertrandon de la
Brocquière and which culminated in the massacre of 1860. Yet they are a
notoriously timid race and make, physically and morally, the worst of
soldiers: we proved that under my late friend Fred. Walpole in the
Bashi-Buzuks during the old Crimean war. The men looked very fine
fellows and after a month in camp fell off to the condition of old
women.

[FN#591] Arab. "Rukhám," properly = alabaster and "Marmar" = marble;
but the two are often confounded.

[FN#592] He was ceremonially impure after touching a corpse.

[FN#593] The phrase is perfectly appropriate: Cairo without "her Nile"
would be nothing.

[FN#594] "The market was hot" say the Hindustanis. This would begin
between 7 and 8 a.m.

[FN#595] Arab. Al-Faranj, Europeans generally. It is derived from "Gens
Francorum," and dates from Crusading days when the French played the
leading part. Hence the Lingua Franca, the Levantine jargon, of which
Molière has left such a witty specimen.

[FN#596] A process familiar to European surgery of the same date.

[FN#597] In sign of disappointment, regret, vexation; a gesture still
common amongst Moslems and corresponding in significance to a certain
extent with our stamping, wringing the hands and so forth. It is not
mentioned in the Koran where, however, we find "biting fingers' ends
out of wrath" against a man (chapt. iii.).

[FN#598] This is no unmerited scandal. The Cairenes, especially the
feminine half (for reasons elsewhere given), have always been held
exceedingly debauched. Even the modest Lane gives a "shocking" story of
a woman enjoying her lover under the nose of her husband and confining
the latter in a madhouse (chapt. xiii.). With civilisation, which
objects to the good old remedy, the sword, they become worse: and the
Kazi's court is crowded with would-be divorcees. Under English rule the
evil has reached its acme because it goes unpunished: in the avenues of
the new Isma'iliyah Quarter, inhabited by Europeans, women, even young
women, will threaten to expose their persons unless they receive
"bakhshísh." It was the same in Sind when husbands were assured that
they would be hanged for cutting down adulterous wives: at once after
its conquest the women broke loose; and in 1843-50, if a young officer
sent to the bazar for a girl, half-a-dozen would troop to his quarters.
Indeed more than once the professional prostitutes threatened to
memorialise Sir Charles Napier because the "modest women," the "ladies"
were taking the bread out of their mouths. The same was the case at
Kabul (Caboul) of Afghanistan in the old war of 1840; and here the
women had more excuse, the husbands being notable sodomites as the song
has it.

     The worth of slit the Afghan knows;
     The worth of hole the Kábul-man.

[FN#599] So that he might not have to do with three sisters-german.
Moreover amongst Moslems a girl's conduct is presaged by that of her
mother; and if one sister go wrong, the other is expected to follow
suit. Practically the rule applies everywhere, "like mother like
daughter."

[FN#600] In sign of dissent; as opposed to nodding the head which
signifies assent. These are two items, apparently instinctive and
universal, of man's gesture-language which has been so highly
cultivated by sundry North American tribes and by the surdo-mute
establishments of Europe.

[FN#601] This "Futur" is the real "breakfast" of the East, the "Chhoti
házri" (petit déjeûner) of India, a bit of bread, a cup of coffee or
tea and a pipe on rising. In the text, however, it is a ceremonious
affair.

[FN#602] Arab. "Nahs," a word of many meanings; a sinister aspect of
the stars (as in Hebr. and Aram.) or, adjectivally, sinister, of
ill-omen. Vulgarly it is used as the reverse of nice and corresponds,
after a fashion, with our "nasty."

[FN#603] "Window-gardening," new in England, is an old practice in the
East.

[FN#604] Her pimping instinct at once revealed the case to her.

[FN#605] The usual "pander-dodge" to get more money.

[FN#606] The writer means that the old woman's account was all false,
to increase apparent difficulties and pour se faire valoir.

[FN#607] Arab. "Yá Khálati" =mother's sister; a familiar address to the
old, as uncle or nuncle (father's brother) to a man. The Arabs also
hold that as a girl resembles her mother so a boy follows his uncle
(mother's brother): hence the address "Ya tayyib al-Khál!" = O thou
nephew of a good uncle. I have noted that physically this is often
fact.

[FN#608] "Ay w' Alláhi," contracted popularly to Aywa, a word in every
Moslem mouth and shunned by Christians because against orders Hebrew
and Christian. The better educated Turks now eschew that eternal
reference to Allah which appears in The Nights and which is still the
custom of the vulgar throughout the world of Al-Islam.

[FN#609] The "Muzayyin" or barber in the East brings his basin and
budget under his arm: he is not content only to shave, he must scrape
the forehead, trim the eyebrows, pass the blade lightly over the nose
and correct the upper and lower lines of the mustachios, opening the
central parting and so forth. He is not a whit less a tattler and a
scandal monger than the old Roman tonsor or Figaro, his confrère in
Southern Europe. The whole scene of the Barber is admirable, an
excellent specimen of Arab humour and not over-caricatured. We all have
met him.

[FN#610] Abdullah ibn Abbas was a cousin and a companion of the
Apostle, also a well known Commentator on the Koran and conserver of
the traditions of Mohammed.

[FN#611] I have noticed the antiquity of this father of our sextant, a
fragment of which was found in the Palace of Sennacherib. More
concerning the "Arstable" (as Chaucer calls it) is given in my
"Camoens: his Life and his Lusiads," p. 381.

[FN#612] Arab. "Simiyá" to rhyme with Kímiyá (alchemy proper). It is a
subordinate branch of the Ilm al-Ruháni which I would translate
"Spiritualism," and which is divided into two great branches, "Ilwí or
Rahmáni" (the high or related to the Deity) and Siflí or Shaytáni (low,
Satanic). To the latter belongs Al-Sahr, magic or the black art proper,
gramarye, egromancy, while Al-Simiyá is white magic, electro-biology, a
kind of natural and deceptive magic, in which drugs and perfumes
exercise an important action. One of its principal branches is the Darb
al-Mandal or magic mirror, of which more in a future page. See
Boccaccio's Day x. Novel 5.

[FN#613] Chap. iii., 128. See Sale (in loco) for the noble application
of this text by the Imam Hasan, son of the Caliph Ali.

[FN#614] These proverbs at once remind us of our old friend Sancho
Panza and are equally true to nature in the mouth of the Arab and of
the Spaniard.

[FN#615] Our nurses always carry in the arms: Arabs place the children
astraddle upon the hip and when older on the shoulder.

[FN#616] Eastern clothes allow this biblical display of sorrow and
vexation, which with our European garb would look absurd: we must
satisfy ourselves with maltreating our hats

[FN#617] Koran xlviii., 8. It may be observed that according to the
Ahádis (sayings of the Prophet) and the Sunnat (sayings and doings of
Mahommed), all the hair should be allowed to grow or the whole head be
clean shaven. Hence the "Shúshah," or topknot, supposed to be left as a
handle for drawing the wearer into Paradise, and the Zulf, or
side-locks, somewhat like the ringlets of the Polish Jews, are both
vain "Bida'at," or innovations, and therefore technically termed
"Makrúh," a practice not laudable, neither "Halál" (perfectly lawful)
nor "Harám" (forbidden by the law). When boys are first shaved
generally in the second or third year, a tuft is left on the crown and
another over the forehead; but this is not the fashion amongst adults.
Abu Hanifah, if I am rightly informed, wrote a treatise on the Shushah
or long lock growing from the Násiyah (head-poll) which is also a
precaution lest the decapitated Moslem's mouth be defiled by an impure
hand; and thus it would resemble the chivalry lock by which the Redskin
brave (and even the "cowboy" of better times) facilitated the removal
of his own scalp. Possibly the Turks had learned the practice from the
Chinese and introduced it into Baghdad (Pilgrimage i., 240). The Badawi
plait their locks in Kurún (horns) or Jadáil (ringlets) which are
undone only to be washed with the water of the she-camel. The wild
Sherifs wear Haffah, long elf-locks hanging down both sides of the
throat, and shaved away about a finger's breadth round the forehead and
behind the neck (Pilgrimage iii., 35-36). I have elsewhere noted the
accroche-coeurs, the "idiot fringe," etc.

[FN#618] Meats are rarely coloured in modern days; but Persian cooks
are great adepts in staining rice for the "Puláo (which we call after
its Turkish corruption "pilaff"): it sometimes appears in
rainbow-colours, red, yellow and blue; and in India is covered with
gold and silver leaf. Europe retains the practice in tinting Pasch
(Easter) eggs, the survival of the mundane ovum which was hatched at
Easter-tide; and they are dyed red in allusion to the Blood of
Redemption.

[FN#619] As I have noticed, this is a mixture.

[FN#620] We say:—

     Tis rare the father in the son we see:
     He sometimes rises in the third degree.

[FN#621] Arab. "Ballán" i.e. the body-servant: "Ballánah" is a
tire-woman.

[FN#622] Arab. "Darabukkah" a drum made of wood or earthen-ware (Lane,
M. E., xviii.), and used by all in Egypt.

[FN#623] Arab. "Naihah" more generally "Naddábah" Lat. præfica or
carina, a hired mourner, the Irish "Keener" at the conclamatio or
coronach, where the Hullabaloo, Hulululu or Ululoo showed the
survivors' sorrow.

[FN#624] These doggerels, which are like our street melodies, are now
forgotten and others have taken their place. A few years ago one often
heard, "Dus ya lalli" (Tread, O my joy) and "Názil il'al-Ganínah" (Down
into the garden) and these in due turn became obsolete. Lane (M. E.
chapt. xviii.) gives the former e.g.

     Tread, O my joy! Tread, O my joy!
     Love of my love brings sore annoy,

A chorus to such stanzas as:—

Alexandrian damsels rare! * Daintily o'er the floor ye fare: Your lips
are sweet, are sugar-sweet, * And purfled Cashmere shawls ye wear!

It may be noted that "humming" is not a favourite practice with
Moslems; if one of the company begin, another will say, "Go to the
Kahwah" (the coffee-house, the proper music-hall) "and sing there!" I
have elsewhere observed their dislike to Al-sifr or whistling.

[FN#625] Arab. Khalí'a = worn out, crafty, an outlaw; used like Span.
"Perdido."

[FN#626] "Zabbál" is the scavenger, lit. a dung-drawer, especially for
the use of the Hammam which is heated with the droppings of animals.
"Wakkád" (stoker) is the servant who turns the fire. The verses are
mere nonsense to suit the Barber's humour.

[FN#627] Arab. "Yá bárid" = O fool.

[FN#628] This form of blessing is chanted from the Minaret about
half-an-hour before midday, when the worshippers take their places in
the mosque. At noon there is the usual Azán or prayer-call, and each
man performs a two-bow, in honour of the mosque and its gathering, as
it were. The Prophet is then blessed and a second Salám is called from
the raised ambo or platform (dikkah) by the divines who repeat the
midday-call. Then an Imam recites the first Khutbah, or sermon "of
praise"; and the congregation worships in silence. This is followed by
the second exhortation "of Wa'az," dispensing the words of wisdom. The
Imam now stands up before the Mihráb (prayer niche) and recites the
Ikámah which is the common Azan with one only difference: after "Hie ye
to salvation" it adds "Come is the time of supplication;" whence the
name, "causing" (prayer) "to stand" (i.e., to begin). Hereupon the
worshippers recite the Farz or Koran commanded noon-prayer of Friday;
and the unco' guid add a host of superogatories Those who would study
the subject may consult Lane (M. E. chapt. iii. and its abstract in his
"Arabian Nights," I, p. 430, or note 69 to chapt. v.).

[FN#629] i.e., the women loosed their hair; an immodesty sanctioned
only by a great calamity.

[FN#630] These small shops are composed of a "but" and a "ben."
(Pilgrimage i., 99.)

[FN#631] Arab. "Kawwád," a popular term of abuse; hence the Span. and
Port. "Alco-viteiro." The Italian "Galeotto" is from Galahalt, not
Galahad.

[FN#632] i.e., "one seeking assistance in Allah." He was the son of
Al-Záhir bi'lláh (one pre-eminent by the decree of Allah). Lane says
(i. 430), "great-grandson of Harun al-Rashid," alluding to the first
Mustansir son of Al-Mutawakkil (regn. A.H. 247-248 =861-862). But this
is the 56th Abbaside and regn. A. H. 623-640 (= 1226-1242).

[FN#633] Arab. "Yaum al-Id," the Kurban Bairam of the Turks, the
Pilgrimage festival. The story is historical. In the "Akd," a
miscellany compiled by Ibn Abd Rabbuh (vulg. Rabbi-hi) of Cordova, who
ob. A. H. 328 = 940 we read:—A sponger found ten criminals and followed
them, imagining they were going to a feast; but lo, they were going to
their deaths! And when they were slain and he remained, he was brought
before the Khalifah (Al Maamun) and Ibrahim son of Al-Mahdi related a
tale to procure pardon for the man, whereupon the Khalifah pardoned
him. (Lane ii., 506.)

[FN#634] Arab. "Nata' al-Dam"; the former word was noticed in the Tale
of the Bull and the Ass. The leather of blood was not unlike the Sufrah
and could be folded into a bag by a string running through rings round
the edges. Moslem executioners were very expert and seldom failed to
strike off the head with a single blow of the thin narrow blade with
razor-edge, hard as diamond withal, which contrasted so strongly with
the great coarse chopper of the European headsman.

[FN#635] The ground floor, which in all hot countries is held, and
rightly so, unwholesome during sleep, is usually let for shops. This is
also the case throughout Southern Europe, and extends to the Canary
Islands and the Brazil.

[FN#636] This serious contemplation of street-scenery is one of the
pleasures of the Harems.

[FN#637] We should say "smiled at him": the laugh was not intended as
an affront.

[FN#638] Arab. "Fals ahmar." Fals is a fish-scale, also the smaller
coin and the plural "Fulús" is the vulgar term for money (= Ital.
quattrini ) without specifying the coin. It must not be confounded with
the "Fazzah," alias "Nuss," alias "Páráh" (Turk.); the latter being
made, not of "red copper" but of a vile alloy containing, like the
Greek "Asper," some silver; and representing, when at par, the fortieth
of a piastre, the latter=2d. 2/5ths.

[FN#639] Arab "Farajiyah " a long-sleeved robe; Lane's "Farageeyeh,"
(M. E., chapt. i)

[FN#640] The tailor in the East, as in Southern Europe, is made to cut
out the cloth in presence of its owner, to prevent "cabbaging."

[FN#641] Expecting a present.

[FN#642] Alluding to the saying, "Kiss is the key to Kitty."

[FN#643] The "panel-dodge" is fatally common throughout the East, where
a man found in the house of another is helpless.

[FN#644] This was the beginning of horseplay which often ends in a
bastinado.

[FN#645] Hair-dyes, in the East, are all of vegetable matter, henna,
indigo-leaves, galls, etc.: our mineral dyes are, happily for them,
unknown. Herklots will supply a host of recipes The Egyptian mixture
which I quoted in Pilgrimage (ii., 274) is sulphate of iron and
ammoniure of iron one part and gall nuts two parts, infused in eight
parts of distilled water. It is innocuous but very poor as a dye.

[FN#646] Arab. Amrad, etymologically "beardless and handsome," but
often used in a bad sense, to denote an effeminate, a catamite.

[FN#647] The Hindus prefer "having the cardinal points as her sole
garment." "Vêtu de climat," says Madame de Stael. In Paris nude statues
are "draped in cerulean blue." Rabelais (iv.,29) robes King Shrovetide
in grey and gold of a comical cut, nothing before, nothing behind, with
sleeves of the same.

[FN#648] This scene used to be enacted a few years ago in Paris for the
benefit of concealed spectators, a young American being the victim. It
was put down when one of the lookers-on lost his eye by a pen-knife
thrust into the "crevice."

[FN#649] Meaning that the trick had been played by the Wazir's wife or
daughter. I could mention sundry names at Cairo whose charming owners
have done worse things than this unseemly frolic.

[FN#650] Arab. "Shayyun li'lláhi," a beggar's formula = per amor di
Dio.

[FN#651] Noting how sharp-eared the blind become.

[FN#652] The blind in Egypt are notorious for insolence and violence,
fanaticism and rapacity. Not a few foreigners have suffered from them
(Pilgrimage i., 148). In former times many were blinded in infancy by
their mothers, and others blinded themselves to escape conscription or
honest hard work. They could always obtain food, especially as
Mu'ezzins and were preferred because they could not take advantage of
the minaret by spying into their neighbours' households. The Egyptian
race is chronically weak-eyed, the effect of the damp hot climate of
the valley, where ophthalmia prevailed even during the pre-Pharaohnic
days. The great Sesostris died stone-blind and his successor lost his
sight for ten years (Pilgrimage ii., 176). That the Fellahs are now
congenitally weak-eyed, may be seen by comparing them with negroes
imported from Central Africa. Ophthalmia rages, especially during the
damp season, in the lower Nile-valley; and the best cure for it is a
fortnight's trip to the Desert where, despite glare, sand and wind, the
eye readily recovers tone.

[FN#653] i.e., with kicks and cuffs and blows, as is the custom.
(Pilgrimage i., 174.)

[FN#654] Arab. Káid (whence "Alcayde") a word still much used in North
Western Africa.

[FN#655] Arab. "Sullam" = lit. a ladder; a frame-work of sticks, used
by way of our triangles or whipping-posts.

[FN#656] This is one of the feats of Al-Símiyá = white magic;
fascinating the eyes. In Europe it has lately taken the name of
"Electro-biology."

[FN#657] again by means of the "Símiyá" or power of fascination
possessed by the old scoundrel.

[FN#658] A formula for averting "Al-Ayn," the evil eye. It is always
unlucky to meet a one-eyed man, especially the first thing in the
morning and when setting out on any errand. The idea is that the
fascinated one will suffer from some action of the physical eye.
Monoculars also are held to be rogues: so the Sanskrit saying "Few
one-eyed men be honest men."

[FN#659] Al-Nashshár from Nashr = sawing: so the fiddler in Italian is
called the "village-saw" (Sega del villaggio). He is the Alnaschar of
the Englished Galland and Richardson. The tale is very old. It appears
as the Brahman and the Pot of Rice in the Panchatantra; and Professor
Benfey believes (as usual with him) that this, with many others,
derives from a Buddhist source. But I would distinctly derive it from
Æsop's market-woman who kicked over her eggs, whence the Lat. prov.
Ante victoriam canere triumphum = to sell the skin before you have
caught the bear. In the "Kalilah and Dimnah" and its numerous offspring
it is the "Ascetic with his Jar of oil and honey;" in Rabelais (i., 33)
Echephron's shoemaker spills his milk, and so La Perette in La
Fontaine. See M. Max Muller's "Chips," (vol. iii., appendix) The
curious reader will compare my version with that which appears at the
end of Richardson's Arabic Grammar (Edit. Of 1811): he had a better, or
rather a fuller MS. (p. 199) than any yet printed.

[FN#660] Arab. "Atr" = any perfume, especially oil of roses; whence our
word "Ottar,' through the Turkish corruption.

[FN#661] The texts give "dirhams" (100,000 = 5,000 dinars) for
"dinars," a clerical error as the sequel shows.

[FN#662] "Young slaves," says Richardson, losing "colour."

[FN#663] Nothing more calculated to give affront than such a refusal.
Richardson (p. 204) who, however, doubts his own version (p. 208), here
translates, "and I will not give liberty to my soul (spouse) but in her
apartments." The Arabic, or rather Cairene, is, "wa lá akhalli rúhi" I
will not let myself go, i.e., be my everyday self, etc.

[FN#664] "Whilst she is in astonishment and terror." (Richardson.)

[FN#665] "Chamber of robes," Richardson, whose text has "Nám" for
"Manám."

[FN#666] "Till I compleat her distress," Richardson, whose text is
corrupt.

[FN#667] "Sleep by her side," R. the word "Náma" bearing both senses.

[FN#668] "Will take my hand," R. "takabbal" being also ambiguous.

[FN#669] Arab. "Mu'arras" one who brings about "'Ars," marriages, etc.
So the Germ. = "Kupplerinn" a Coupleress. It is one of the many
synonyms for a pimp, and a word in general use (Pilgrimage i., 276).The
most insulting term, like Dayyús, insinuates that the man panders for
his own wife.

[FN#670] Of hands and face, etc. See Night cccclxiv.

[FN#671] Arab. "Sadakah" (sincerity), voluntary or superogatory alms,
opposed to "Zakát" (purification), legal alms which are indispensable.
"Prayer carries us half way to Allah, fasting brings us to the door of
His palace and alms deeds (Sadakah) cause us to enter." For "Zakát" no
especial rate is fixed, but it should not be less than one-fortieth of
property or two and a half per cent. Thus Al-lslam is, as far as I
know, the only faith which makes a poor-rate (Zakát) obligatory and
which has invented a property-tax, as opposed the unjust and unfair
income-tax upon which England prides herself.

[FN#672] A Greek girl.

[FN#673] This was making himself very easy; and the idea is that the
gold in the pouch caused him to be so bold. Lane's explanation (in
loco) is all wrong. The pride engendered by sudden possession of money
is a lieu commun amongst Eastern story tellers; even in the
beast-fables the mouse which has stolen a few gold pieces becomes
confident and stout-hearted.

[FN#674] Arab. "al-Málihah" also means the beautiful (fem.) from
Milh=salt, splendour, etc., the Mac edit. has "Mumallihah" = a
salt-vessel.

[FN#675] i.e., to see if he felt the smart.

[FN#676] Arab. "Sardábeh" (Persian)=an underground room used for
coolness in the hot season. It is unknown in Cairo but every house in
Baghdad, in fact throughout the Mesopotamian cities, has one. It is on
the principle of the underground cellar without which wine will not
keep: Lane (i., 406) calls it a "vault".

[FN#677] In the orig. "O old woman!" which is insulting.

[FN#678] So the Italians say "a quail to skin."

[FN#679] "Amán" is the word used for quarter on the battle-field; and
there are Joe Millers about our soldiers in India mistaking it for "a
man" or (Scottice) "a mon."

[FN#680] Illustrating the Persian saying "Allah himself cannot help a
fool."

[FN#681] Any article taken from the person and given to a criminal is a
promise of pardon, of course on the implied condition of plenary
confession and of becoming "King's evidence."

[FN#682] A naïve proposal to share the plunder.

[FN#683] In popular literature "Schacabac.", And from this tale comes
our saying "A Barmecide's Feast," i.e., an illusion.

[FN#684] The Castrato at the door is still (I have said) the fashion of
Cairo and he acts "Suisse" with a witness.

[FN#685] As usual in the East, the mansion was a hollow square
surrounding what in Spain is called Patio: the outer entrance was far
from the inner, showing the extent of the grounds.

[FN#686] "Nahnu málihín" = we are on terms of salt, said and say the
Arabs. But the traveller must not trust in these days to the once
sacred tie; there are tribes which will give bread with one hand and
stab with the other. The Eastern use of salt is a curious contrast with
that of Westerns, who made it an invidious and inhospitable
distinction, e.g., to sit above the salt-cellar and below the salt.
Amongst the ancients, however, "he took bread and salt" means he swore,
the food being eaten when an oath was taken. Hence the "Bride cake" of
salt, water and flour.

[FN#687] Arab. "Harísah," the meat-pudding before explained.

[FN#688] Arab. "Sikbáj," before explained; it is held to be a lordly
dish, invented by Khusraw Parwiz. "Fatted duck" says the Bresl. Edit.
ii., 308, with more reason.

[FN#689] I was reproved in Southern Abyssinia for eating without this
champing, "Thou feedest like a beggar who muncheth silently in his
corner;" and presently found that it was a sign of good breeding to eat
as noisily as possible.

[FN#690] Barley in Arabia is, like our oats, food for horses: it
fattens at the same time that it cools them. Had this been known to our
cavalry when we first occupied Egypt in 1883-4 our losses in
horse-flesh would have been far less; but official ignorance persisted
in feeding the cattle upon heating oats and the riders upon beef, which
is indigestible, instead of mutton, which is wholesome.

[FN#691] i.e. "I conjure thee by God."

[FN#692] i.e. "This is the very thing for thee."

[FN#693] i.e., at random.

[FN#694] This is the way of slaughtering the camel, whose throat is
never cut on account of the thickness of the muscles. "Égorger un
chameau" is a mistake often made in French books.

[FN#695] i.e. I will break bounds.

[FN#696] The Arabs have a saying corresponding with the dictum of the
Salernitan school:—

     Noscitur a labiis quantum sit virginis antrum:
     Noscitur a naso quanta sit hasta viro;
     (A maiden's mouth shows what's the make of her _chose;_
     And man's mentule one knows by the length of his nose.)

Whereto I would add:—

     And the eyebrows disclose how the lower wig grows.

The observations are purely empirical but, as far as my experience
extends, correct.

[FN#697] Arab. "Kahkahah," a very low proceeding.

[FN#698] Or "for every death there is a cause;" but the older Arabs had
a saying corresponding with "Deus non fecit mortem."

[FN#699] The King's barber is usually a man of rank for the best of
reasons, that he holds his Sovereign's life between his fingers. One of
these noble Figaros in India married an English lady who was, they say,
unpleasantly surprised to find out what were her husband's official
duties.
