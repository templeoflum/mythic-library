ccix.

[FN#184] Arab. "Sár" (Thár) the revenge-right recognised by law and
custom (Pilgrimage, iii., 69).

[FN#185] That is "We all swim in the same boat."

[FN#186] Ja'afar ever acts, on such occasions, the part of a wise and
sensible man compelled to join in a foolish frolic. He contrasts
strongly with the Caliph, a headstrong despot who will not be gainsaid,
whatever be the whim of the moment. But Easterns would look upon this
as a proof of his "kingliness."

[FN#187] Arab. "Wa'l-Salám" (pronounced Was-Salám); meaning "and here
ends the matter." In our slang we say "All right, and the child's name
is Antony."

[FN#188] This is a favourite jingle, the play being upon "ibrat" (a
needle-graver) and " 'ibrat" (an example, a warning).

[FN#189] That is "make his bow," as the English peasant pulls his
forelock. Lane (i., 249) suggests, as an afterthought, that it
means:—"Recover thy senses; in allusion to a person's drawing his hand
over his head after sleep or a fit." But it occurs elsewhere in the
sense of "cut thy stick."

[FN#190] This would be a separate building like our family tomb and
probably domed, resembling that mentioned in "The King of the Black
Islands." Europeans usually call it "a little Wali;" or, as they write
it, "Wely," the contained for the container; the "Santon" for the
"Santon's tomb." I have noticed this curious confusion (which begins
with Robinson, i. 322) in "Unexplored Syria," i. 161.

[FN#191] Arab. "Wiswás," = diabolical temptation or suggestion. The
"Wiswásí" is a man with scruples (scrupulus, a pebble in the shoe),
e.g. one who fears that his ablutions were deficient, etc.

[FN#192] Arab. "Katf" = pinioning by tying the arms behind the back and
shoulders (Kitf) a dire disgrace to free-born men.

[FN#193] Arab. "Nafs."=Hebr. Nephesh (Nafash) =soul, life as opposed to
"Ruach"= spirit and breath. In these places it is equivalent to "I said
to myself." Another form of the root is "Nafas," breath, with an idea
of inspiration: so 'Sáhib Nafas" (=master of breath) is a minor saint
who heals by expiration, a matter familiar to mesmerists (Pilgrimage,
i., 86).

[FN#194] Arab. "Kaus al-Banduk;" the "pellet bow" of modern India; with
two strings joined by a bit of cloth which supports a ball of dry clay
or stone. It is chiefly used for birding.

[FN#195] In the East blinding was a common practice, especially in the
case of junior princes not required as heirs. A deep perpendicular
incision was made down each corner of the eyes; the lids were lifted
and the balls removed by cutting the optic nerve and the muscles. The
later Caliphs blinded their victims by passing a red-hot sword blade
close to the orbit or a needle over the eye-ball. About the same time
in Europe the operation was performed with a heated metal basin—the
well known bacinare (used by Ariosto), as happened to Pier delle Vigne
(Petrus de Vineâ), the "godfather of modern Italian."

[FN#196] Arab. "Khinzír" (by Europeans pronounced "Hanzír"), prop. a
wild-boar, but popularly used like our "you pig!"

[FN#197] Striking with the shoe, the pipe-stick and similar articles is
highly insulting, because they are not made, like whips and scourges,
for such purpose. Here the East and the West differ diametrically.
"Wounds which are given by instruments which are in one's hands by
chance do not disgrace a man," says Cervantes (D. Q. i., chapt. 15),
and goes on to prove that if a Zapatero (cobbler) cudgel another with
his form or last, the latter must not consider himself cudgelled. The
reverse in the East where a blow of a pipe stick cost Mahommed Ali
Pasha's son his life: Ishmail Pasha was burned to death by Malik Nimr,
chief of Shendy (Pilgrimage, i., 203). Moreover, the actual wound is
less considered in Moslem law than the instrument which caused it: so
sticks and stones are venial weapons, whilst sword and dagger, gun and
pistol are felonious. See ibid. (i., 336) for a note upon the weapons
with which nations are policed.

[FN#198] Incest is now abominable everywhere except amongst the
overcrowded poor of great and civilised cities. Yet such unions were
common and lawful amongst ancient and highly cultivated peoples, as the
Egyptians (Isis and Osiris), Assyrians and ancient Persians.
Physiologically they are injurious only when the parents have
constitutional defects: if both are sound, the issue, as amongst the
so-called "lower animals " is viable and healthy.

[FN#199] Dwellers in the Northern Temperates can hardly imagine what a
dust-storm is in sun parched tropical lands. In Sind we were often
obliged to use candles at mid-day, while above the dust was a sun that
would roast an egg.

[FN#200] Arab. “’Urban,” now always used of the wild people, whom the
French have taught us to call _les Bedouins_; "Badw" being a waste or
desert, and Badawi (fem. Badawíyah, plur. Badáwi and Bidwán), a man of
the waste. Europeans have also learnt to miscall the Egyptians "Arabs":
the difference is as great as between an Englishman and a Spaniard.
Arabs proper divide their race into sundry successive families. "The
Arab al-Arabá" (or al-Aribah, or al-Urubíyat) are the autochthones,
prehistoric, proto-historic and extinct tribes; for instance, a few of
the Adites who being at Meccah escaped the destruction of their wicked
nation, but mingled with other classes. The "Arab al-Muta'arribah,"
(Arabised Arabs) are the first advenæ represented by such noble strains
as the Koraysh (Koreish), some still surviving. The "Arab
al-Musta'aribah" (insititious, naturalized or instituted Arabs, men who
claim to be Arabs) are Arabs like the Sinaites, the Egyptians and the
Maroccans descended by intermarriage with other races. Hence our
"Mosarabians" and the "Marrabais" of Rabelais (not, "a word compounded
of Maurus and Arabs"). Some genealogists, however, make the
Muta'arribah descendants of Kahtan (possibly the Joktan of Genesis x.,
a comparatively modern document, B.C. 700?); and the Musta'aribah those
descended from Adnán the origin of Arab genealogy. And, lastly, are the
"Arab al-Musta'ajimah," barbarised Arabs, like the present population
of Meccah and Al-Medinah. Besides these there are other tribes whose
origin is still unknown, such as the Mahrah tribes of Hazramaut, the
"Akhdám" (=serviles) of Oman (Maskat); and the "Ebná" of Al-Yaman: Ibn
Ishak supposes the latter to be descended from the Persian soldiers of
Anushirwan who expelled the Abyssinian invader from Southern Arabia.
(Pilgrimage, iii., 31, etc.)

[FN#201] Arab. "Amír al-Muuminín." The title was assumed by the Caliph
Omar to obviate the inconvenience of calling himself "Khalífah"
(successor) of the Khalífah of the Apostle of Allah (i.e. Abu Bakr);
which after a few generations would become impossible. It means "Emir
(chief or prince) of the Muumins," men who hold to the (true Moslem)
Faith, the "Imán" (theory, fundamental articles) as opposed to the
"Dín," ordinance or practice of the religion. It once became a Wazirial
time conferred by Sultan Malikshah (King King-king) on his Nizám
al-Mulk. (Richardson's Dissert. lviii.)

[FN#202] This may also mean "according to the seven editions of the
Koran " the old revisions and so forth (Sale, Sect. iii. and D'Herbelot
"Alcoran.") The schools of the "Mukri," who teach the right
pronunciation wherein a mistake might be sinful, are seven, Harnzah,
Ibn Katír, Ya'akúb, Ibn Amir, Kisái, Asim and Hafs, the latter being
the favourite with the Hanafis and the only one now generally known in
Al-Islam.

[FN#203] Arab. "Sadd"=wall, dyke, etc. the "bund" or "band" of
Anglo-India. Hence the "Sadd" on the Nile, the banks of grass and
floating islands which "wall" the stream. There are few sights more
appalling than a sandstorm in the desert, the "Zauba'ah" as the Arabs
call it. Devils, or pillars of sand, vertical and inclined, measuring a
thousand feet high, rush over the plain lashing the sand at their base
like a sea surging under a furious whirlwind; shearing the grass clean
away from the roots, tearing up trees, which are whirled like leaves
and sticks in air and sweeping away tents and houses as if they were
bits of paper. At last the columns join at the top and form, perhaps
three thousand feet above the earth, a gigantic cloud of yellow sand
which obliterates not only the horizon but even the mid-day sun. These
sand-spouts are the terror of travellers. In Sind and the Punjab we
have the dust-storm which for darkness, I have said, beats the blackest
London fog.

[FN#204] Arab. Sár = the vendetta, before mentioned, as dreaded in
Arabia as in Corsica.

[FN#205] Arab. "Ghútah," usually a place where irrigation is abundant.
It especially applies (in books) to the Damascus-plain because "it
abounds with water and fruit trees." Bochart (Geog. Sacra, p. 90)
derives ﬠיטה (utah) from ﬠוץ Uz, son of Arab, who (he says) founded
Damascus. The Ghutah is one of the four earthly paradises, the others
being Basrah (Bassorah), Shiraz and Samarcand. Its peculiarity is the
likeness to a seaport; the Desert which rolls up almost to its doors
being the sea and its ships being the camels. The first Arab to whom we
owe this admirable term for the "Companion of Job" is "Tarafah" one of
the poets of the Suspended Poems: he likens (v. v. 3, 4) the camels
which bore away his beloved to ships sailing from Aduli. But "ships of
the desert" is doubtless a term of the highest antiquity.

[FN#206] The exigencies of the "Saj'a," or rhymed prose, disjoint this
and many similar passages.

[FN#207] The "Ebony" Islands; Scott's "Isle of Ebene," i., 217.

[FN#208] "Jarjarís" in the Bul. Edit.

[FN#209] Arab. "Takbís." Many Easterns can hardly sleep without this
kneading of the muscles, this "rubbing" whose hygienic properties
England is now learning.

[FN#210] The converse of the breast being broadened, the drooping,
"draggle-tail" gait compared with the head held high and the chest
inflated.

[FN#211] This penalty is mentioned in the Koran (chapt. v.) as fit for
those who fight against Allah and his Apostle, but commentators are not
agreed if the sinners are first to be put to death or to hang on the
cross till they die. Pharaoh (chapt. xx.) threatens to crucify his
magicians on palm-trees, and is held to be the first crucifier.

[FN#212] Arab. "'Ajami"=foreigner, esp. a Persian: the latter in The
Nights is mostly a villain. I must here remark that the contemptible
condition of Persians in Al-Hijáz (which I noted in 1852, Pilgrimage,
i., 327) has completely changed. They are no longer, "The slippers of
Ali and hounds of Omar:" they have learned the force of union and now,
instead of being bullied, they bully.

[FN#213] The Calc. Edit. turns them into Tailors (Khayyátín) and
Torrens does not see the misprint.

[FN#214] i.e. Axe and sandals.

[FN#215] Lit. "Strike his neck."

[FN#216] A phrase which will frequently recur; meaning the situation
suggested such words a these.

[FN#217] The smiter with the evil eye is called “A’in” and the person
smitten “Ma’ín” or “Ma’ún.”

[FN#218] Arab. "Sákiyah," the well-known Persian wheel with pots and
buckets attached to the tire. It is of many kinds, the boxed, etc.,
etc., and it is possibly alluded to in the "pitcher broken at the
fountain" (Ecclesiastes xii. 6) an accident often occurring to the
modern "Noria." Travellers mostly abuse its "dismal creaking" and
"mournful monotony": I have defended the music of the water-wheel in
Pilgrimage ii. 198.

[FN#219] Arab. "Zikr" lit. remembering, mentioning (i. c. the names of
Allah), here refers to the meetings of religious for devotional
exercises; the "Zikkirs," as they are called, mostly standing or
sitting in a circle while they ejaculate the Holy Name. These
"rogations" are much affected by Darwayshes, or begging friars, whom
Europe politely divides into "dancing" and "howling"; and, on one
occasion, greatly to the scandal of certain Engländerinns to whom I was
showing the Ezbekiyah I joined the ring of "howlers." Lane (Mod. Egypt,
see index) is profuse upon the subject of "Zikrs" and Zikkírs. It must
not be supposed that they are uneducated men: the better class,
however, prefers more privacy.

[FN#220] As they thought he had been there for prayer or penance.

[FN#221] Arab. "Ziyárat," a visit to a pious person or place.

[FN#222] This is a paternal salute in the East where they are
particular about the part kissed. A witty and not unusually gross
Persian book, called the "Al-Námah" because all questions begin with
"Al" (the Arab article) contains one "Al-Wajib al-busidan?" (what best
deserves bussing?) and the answer is "Kus-i-nau-pashm," (a bobadilla
with a young bush).

[FN#223] A weight of 71-72 English grains in gold; here equivalent to
the diner.

[FN#224] Compare the tale of The Three Crows in Gammer Grethel, Evening
