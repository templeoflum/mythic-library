BOOK II.


PROLOGUE.

  The way of writing Esop chose,
  Sound doctrine by example shows;
  For nothing by these tales is meant,
  So much as that the bad repent;
  And by the pattern that is set,
  Due diligence itself should whet.
  Wherefore, whatever arch conceit
  You in our narratives shall meet
  (If with the critic's ear it take,
  And for some special purpose make),
  Aspires by real use to fame,
  Rather than from an author's name.
  In fact, with all the care I can,
  I shall abide by Esop's plan:
  But if at times I intersperse
  My own materials in the verse,
  That sweet variety may please
  The fancy, and attention ease;
  Receive it in a friendly way;
  Which grace I purpose to repay
  By this consciousness of my song;
  Whose praises, lest they be too long,
  Attend, why you should stint the sneak,
  But give the modest, ere they seek.


FABLE I. THE JUDICIOUS LION.


  A Lion on the carcass stood
  Of a young heifer in the wood;
  A robber that was passing there,
  Came up, and ask'd him for a share.
  "A share," says he, "you should receive,
  But that you seldom ask our leave
  For things so handily removed."
  At which the ruffian was reproved.
  It happen'd that the selfsame day
  A modest pilgrim came that way,
  And when he saw the Lion, fled:
  Says he, "There is no cause of dread,
  In gentle tone--take you the chine,
  Which to your merit I assign."--
  Then having parted what he slew,
  To favour his approach withdrew.
  A great example, worthy praise,
  But not much copied now-a-days!
  For churls have coffers that o'erflow,
  And sheepish worth is poor and low.


II. THE BALD-PATE DUPE.

  Fondling or fondled--any how--
  (Examples of all times allow)
  That men by women must be fleeced.
    A dame, whose years were well increased,
  But skill'd t' affect a youthful mien,
  Was a staid husband's empress queen;
  Who yet sequester'd half his heart
  For a young damsel, brisk and smart.
  They, while each wanted to attach
  Themselves to him, and seem his match,
  Began to tamper with his hair.
  He, pleased with their officious care,
  Was on a sudden made a coot;
  For the young strumpet, branch and root,
  Stripp'd of the hoary hairs his crown,
  E'en as th' old cat grubb'd up the brown.


III. THE MAN AND THE DOG.

  Torn by a Cur, a man was led
  To throw the snappish thief some bread
  Dipt in the blood, which, he was told,
  Had been a remedy of old. Then
  Esop thus:-- "Forbear to show
  A pack of dogs the thing you do,
  Lest they should soon devour us quite,
  When thus rewarded as they bite."
    One wicked miscreant's success
  Makes many more the trade profess.


IV. THE EAGLE, THE CAT, AND THE SOW.

  An Eagle built upon an oak
  A Cat and kittens had bespoke
  A hole about the middle bough;
  And underneath a woodland
  Sow Had placed her pigs upon the ground.
  Then treach'rous Puss a method found
  To overthrow, for her own good,
  The peace of this chance neighbourhood
  First to the Eagle she ascends--
  "Perdition on your head impends,
  And, far too probable, on mine;
  For you observe that grubbing
  Swine Still works the tree to overset,
  Us and our young with ease to get."
  Thus having filled the Eagle's pate
  With consternation very great,
  Down creeps she to the Sow below;
  "The Eagle is your deadly foe,
  And is determined not to spare
  Your pigs, when you shall take the air."
  Here too a terror being spread,
  By what this tattling gossip said,
  She slily to her kittens stole,
  And rested snug within her hole.
  Sneaking from thence with silent tread
  By night her family she fed,
  But look'd out sharply all the day,
  Affecting terror and dismay.
  The Eagle lest the tree should fall,
  Keeps to the boughs, nor stirs at all;
  And anxious for her grunting race,
  The Sow is loth to quit her place.
  In short, they and their young ones starve,
  And leave a prey for Puss to carve.
    Hence warn'd ye credulous and young,
  Be cautious of a double tongue.


V. CÆSAR AND HIS SLAVE.

  There is in town a certain set
  Of mortals, ever in a sweat,
  Who idly bustling here and there,
  Have never any time to spare,
  While upon nothing they discuss
  With heat, and most outrageous fuss,
  Plague to themselves, and to the rest
  A most intolerable pest.
  I will correct this stupid clan
  Of busy-bodies, if I can,
  By a true story; lend an ear,
  'Tis worth a trifler's time to hear.
    Tiberius Cæsar, in his way
  To Naples, on a certain day
  Came to his own Misenian seat,
  (Of old Lucullus's retreat,)
  Which from the mountain top surveys
  Two seas, by looking different ways.
  Here a shrewd slave began to cringe
  With dapper coat and sash of fringe,
  And, as his master walk'd between
  The trees upon the tufted green,
  Finding the weather very hot,
  Officiates with his wat'ring-pot;
  And still attending through the glade,
  Is ostentatious of his aid.
  Cæsar turns to another row,
  Where neither sun nor rain could go;
  He, for the nearest cut he knows,
  Is still before with pot and rose.
  Cæsar observes him twist and shift,
  And understands the fellow's drift;
  "Here, you sir," says th' imperial lord.
  The bustler, hoping a reward,
  Runs skipping up. The chief in jest
  Thus the poor jackanapes address'd
  "As here is no great matter done,
  Small is the premium you have won:
  The cuffs that make a servant free,
  Are for a better man than thee."


VI. THE EAGLE, CARRION CROW, AND TORTOISE.

  No soul can warrant life or right,
  Secure from men of lawless might;
  But if a knave's advice assist,
  'Gainst fraud and force what can exist?
    An Eagle on a Tortoise fell,
  And mounting bore him by the shell:
  She with her house her body screens,
  Nor can be hurt by any means.
  A Carrion Crow came by that way,
  "You've got," says she, "a luscious prey;
  But soon its weight will make you rue,
  Unless I show you what to do."
  The captor promising a share,
  She bids her from the upper air
  To dash the shell against a rock,
  Which would be sever'd by the shock.
  The Eagle follows her behest,
  Then feasts on turtle with his guest.
    Thus she, whom Nature made so strong,
  And safe against external wrong,
  No match for force, and its allies,
  To cruel death a victim dies.


VII. THE MULES AND ROBBERS.

  Two laden Mules were on the road--
  A charge of money was bestowed
  Upon the one, the other bore
  Some sacks of barley. He before.
  Proud of his freight, begun to swell,
  Stretch'd out his neck, and shook his bell.
  The poor one, with an easy pace,
  Came on behind a little space,
  When on a sudden, from the wood
  A gang of thieves before them stood;
  And, while the muleteers engage,
  Wound the poor creature in their rage
  Eager they seize the golden prize,
  But the vile barley-bags despise.
  The plunder'd mule was all forlorn,
  The other thank'd them for their scorn:
  "'Tis now my turn the head to toss,
  Sustaining neither wound nor loss."
  The low estate's from peril clear,
  But wealthy men have much to fear.


VIII. THE STAG AND THE OXEN.

  A Stag unharbour'd by the hounds,
  Forth from his woodland covert bounds,
  And blind with terror, at th' alarm
  Of death, makes to a neighb'ring farm;
  There snug conceals him in some straw,
  Which in an ox's stall he saw.
  "Wretch that thou art!" a bullock cried,
  "That com'st within this place to hide;
  By trusting man you are undone,
  And into sure destruction run."
  But he with suppliant voice replies:
  "Do you but wink with both your eyes,
  I soon shall my occasions shape,
  To make from hence a fair escape."
  The day is spent, the night succeeds,
  The herdsman comes, the cattle feeds,
  But nothing sees--then to and fro
  Time after time the servants go;
  Yet not a soul perceives the case.
  The steward passes by the place,
  Himself no wiser than the rest.
  The joyful Stag his thanks address'd
  To all the Oxen, that he there
  Had found a refuge in despair.
  "We wish you well," an Ox return'd,
  "But for your life are still concern'd,
  For if old Argus come, no doubt,
  His hundred eyes will find you out."
  Scarce had the speaker made an end,
  When from the supper of a friend
  The master enters at the door,
  And, seeing that the steers were poor
  Of late, advances to the rack.
  "Why were the fellow's hands so slack?
  Here's hardly any straw at all,
  Brush down those cobwebs from the wall.
  Pray how much labour would it ask?"
  While thus he undertakes the task,
  To dust, and rummage by degrees,
  The Stag's exalted horns he sees:
  Then calling all his folks around,
  He lays him breathless on the ground.
    The master, as the tale declares,
  Looks sharpest to his own affairs.


EPILOGUE.

  A statue of great cost and fame
  Th' Athenians raised to Esop's name,
  Him setting on th' eternal base,
  Whom servile rank could not disgrace;
  That they might teach to all mankind
  The way to honor's unconfined,
  That glory's due to rising worth,
  And not alone to pomp and birth.
    Since then another seized the post
  Lest I priority should boast,
  This pow'r and praise was yet my own,
  That he should not excel alone:
  Nor is this Envy's jealous ire,
  But Emulation's genuine fire.
    And if Rome should approve my piece,
  She'll soon have more to rival Greece.
  But should th' invidious town declare
  Against my plodding over-care,
  They cannot take away, nor hurt
  Th' internal conscience of desert.
    If these my studies reach their aim,
  And, reader, your attention claim,
  If your perception fully weighs
  The drift of these my labour'd lays;
  Then such success precludes complaint.
  But if the Picture which I paint
  Should happen to attract their sight,
  Whom luckless Nature brought to light,
  Who scorn the labours of a man,
  And when they carp do all they can;
  Yet must this fatal cause to mourn
  With all its bitterness be borne,
  Till fortune be ashamed of days,
  When genius fails, and int'rest sways.
