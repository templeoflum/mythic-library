The tenor of this tale infers
  Two very diff'rent characters;
  Of men self-praised and falsely vain,
  And men of real worth in grain.


XX. THE ESCAPE OF SIMONIDES.

  Th' attention letters can engage,
  Ev'n from a base degen'rate age,
  I've shown before; and now shall show
  Their lustre in another view,
  And tell a memorable tale,
  How much they can with heav'n prevail.
    Simonides, the very same
  We lately had a call to name,
  Agreed for such a sum to blaze
  A certain famous champion's praise.
  He therefore a retirement sought,
  But found the theme on which he wrote
  So scanty, he was forced to use
  Th' accustom'd license of the muse,
  And introduced and praise bestow'd
  On Leda's sons to raise his ode;
  With these the rather making free,
  As heroes in the same degree.
  He warranted his work, and yet
  Could but one third of payment get.
  Upon demanding all the due,
  "Let them," says he, "pay t'other two,
  Who take two places in the song;
  But lest you think I do you wrong
  And part in dudgeon--I invite
  Your company to sup this night,
  For then my friends and kin I see,
  'Mongst which I choose to reckon thee."
  Choused and chagrined, yet shunning blame,
  He promised, set the hour, and came;
  As fearful lest a favour spurn'd
  Should to an open breach be turn'd.
  The splendid banquet shone with plate,
  And preparations full of state
  Made the glad house with clamors roar--
  When on a sudden at the door
  Two youths, with sweat and dust besmear'd,
  Above the human form appear'd,
  And charged forthwith a little scout
  To bid Simonides come out,
  That 'twas his int'rest not to stay.--
  The slave, in trouble and dismay,
  Roused from his seat the feasting bard,
  Who scarce had stirr'd a single yard
  Before the room at once fell in,
  And crush'd the champion and his kin.
  No youths before the door are found.--
  The thing soon spread the country round;
  And when each circumstance was weigh'd,
  They knew the gods that visit made,
  And saved the poet's life in lieu
  Of those two-thirds which yet were due.


EPILOGUE TO EUTYCHUS.

  I yet have stock in hand to spare,
  And could write on--but will forbear--
  First, lest I tire a friend, whose state
  And avocations are so great:
  And then, if other pens should try
  This moral scheme as well as I,
  They may have something to pursue:--
  Yet if the spacious field we view,
  More men are wanting for the plan,
  Rather than matter for the man.
  Now for that prize I make my plea
  You promised to my brevity.
  Keep your kind word; for life, my friend,
  Is daily nearer to its end;
  And I shall share your love the less
  The longer you your hand repress:
  The sooner you the boon insure,
  The more the tenure must endure;
  And if I quick possession take,
  The greater profit must I make,
  While yet declining age subsists,
  A room for friendly aid exists.
  Anon with tasteless years grown weak,
  In vain benevolence will seek
  To do me good--when Death at hand
  Shall come and urge his last demand.
  'Tis folly, you'll be apt to say,
  A thousand times to beg and pray
  Of one with so much worth and sense,
  Whose gen'rous bounty is propense.
  If e'er a miscreant succeeds,
  By fair confession of his deeds,
  An innocent offender's case
  Is far more worthy of your grace.
  You for example sake begin,
  Then others to the lure you'll win,
  And in rotation more and more
  Will soon communicate their store.
  Consider in your mind how far
  At stake your word and honour are;
  And let your closing the debate
  By what I may congratulate.
  I have been guilty of excess
  Beyond my thought in this address
  But 'tis not easy to refrain
  A spirit work'd up to disdain
  By wretches insolent and vile,
  With a clear conscience all the while.
  You'll ask me, sir, at whom I hint--
  In time they may appear in print.
  But give me leave to cite a phrase
  I met with in my boyish days.
  "'Tis dangerous for the mean and low
  Too plain their grievances to show."
  This is advice I shall retain
  While life and sanity remain.
