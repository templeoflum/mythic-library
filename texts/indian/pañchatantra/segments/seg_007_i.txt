BOOK I.

THE PROLOGUE.


The matter which Æsop, the inventor {of Fables}, has provided, I have
polished in Iambic verse. The advantages of {this} little work are
twofold--that it excites laughter, and by counsel guides the life {of
man}. But if any one shall think fit to cavil, because not only wild
beasts, but even trees speak, let him remember that we are disporting in
fables.


FABLE I.

THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.

Driven by thirst, a Wolf and a Lamb had come to the same stream; the
Wolf stood above, and the Lamb at a distance below. Then, the spoiler,
prompted by a ravenous maw, alleged a pretext for a quarrel. "Why," said
he, "have you made the water muddy for me {while I am} drinking?" The
Fleece-bearer, trembling, {answered}: "Prithee, Wolf, how can I do what
you complain of? The water is flowing downwards from you to where I am
drinking." The other, disconcerted by the force of truth, {exclaimed}:
"Six months ago, you slandered me." "Indeed," answered the Lamb, "I was
not born {then}." "By Hercules," said {the Wolf}, "{then 'twas} your
father slandered me;" and so, snatching him up, he tore him to pieces,
killing him unjustly.

This Fable is applicable to those men who, under false pretences,
oppress the innocent.


FABLE II.

THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING.

When Athens[1] was flourishing under just laws, liberty grown wanton
embroiled the city, and license relaxed the reins of ancient discipline.
Upon this, the partisans of factions conspiring, Pisistratus the
Tyrant[2] seized the citadel. When the Athenians were lamenting their
sad servitude (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is
grievous to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, Æsop
related a Fable to the following effect:--

"The Frogs, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with loud clamour
demanded of Jupiter a king, who, by {his} authority, might check their
dissolute manners. The Father of the Gods smiled, and gave them a little
Log, which, on being thrown {among them} startled the timorous race by
the noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had lain for some
time immersed in the mud, one {of them} by chance silently lifted his
head above the water, and having taken a peep at the king, called up all
the rest. Having got the better of their fears, vying with each other,
they swim towards him, and the insolent mob leap upon the Log. After
defiling it with every kind of insult, they sent to Jupiter, requesting
another king, because the one that had been given them was useless. Upon
this, he sent them a Water Snake,[3] who with his sharp teeth began to
gobble them up one after another. Helpless they strive in vain to escape
death; terror deprives them of voice. By stealth, therefore, they send
through Mercury a request to Jupiter, to succour them in their distress.
Then said the God in reply: 'Since you would not be content with your
good fortune, continue to endure your bad fortune.'"

"Do you also, O fellow-citizens," said {Æsop}, "submit to the present
evil, lest a greater one befall you."

    [Footnote I.1: _When Athens_)--Ver. 1. This probably alludes
    to the government of Solon, when Archon of Athens.]

    [Footnote I.2: _Pisistratus the Tyrant_)--Ver. 5. From Suidas
    and Eusebius we learn that Æsop died in the fifty-fourth Olympiad,
    while Pisistratus did not seize the supreme power at Athens till
    the first year of the fifty-fifth. These dates, however, have been
    disputed by many, and partly on the strength of the present
    passage.]

    [Footnote I.3: _A Water-Snake_)--Ver. 24. Pliny tells us that
    the "hydrus" lives in the water, and is exceedingly venomous. Some
    Commentators think that Phædrus, like Æsop, intends to conceal a
    political meaning under this Fable, and that by the Water-Snake he
    means Caligula, and by the Log, Tiberius. Others, perhaps with
    more probability, think that the cruelty of Tiberius alone is
    alluded to in the mention of the snake. Indeed, it is doubtful
    whether Phædrus survived to the time of Caligula: and it is more
    generally believed that the First and Second Books were written in
    the time of Augustus and Tiberius.]


FABLE III.

THE VAIN JACKDAW AND THE PEACOCK.

That one ought not to plume oneself on the merits which belong to
another, but ought rather to pass his life in his own proper guise, Æsop
has given us this illustration:--

A Jackdaw, swelling[4] with empty pride, picked up some feathers which
had fallen from a Peacock, and decked himself out {therewith}; upon
which, despising his own {kind}, he mingled with a beauteous flock of
Peacocks. They tore his feathers from off the impudent bird, and put him
to flight with their beaks. The Jackdaw, {thus} roughly handled, in
grief hastened to return to his own kind; repulsed by whom, he had to
submit to sad disgrace. Then said one of those whom he had formerly
despised: "If you had been content with our station, and had been ready
to put up with what nature had given, you would neither have experienced
the former affront, nor would your ill fortune have had to feel {the
additional pang} of this repulse."

    [Footnote I.4: _A Jackdaw, swelling_)--Ver. 4. Scheffer thinks
    that Sejanus is alluded to under this image.]


FABLE IV.

THE DOG CARRYING SOME MEAT ACROSS A RIVER.

He who covets what belongs to another, deservedly loses his own.

As a Dog, swimming[5] through a river, was carrying a piece of meat, he
saw his own shadow in the watery mirror; and, thinking that it was
another booty carried by another {dog}, attempted to snatch it away; but
his greediness {was} disappointed, he both dropped the food which he was
holding in his mouth, and was after all unable to reach that at which he
grasped.

    [Footnote I.5: _As a Dog swimming_)--Ver. 9. Lessing finds
    some fault with the way in which this Fable is related, and with
    fair reason. The Dog swimming would be likely to disturb the water
    to such a degree, that it would be impossible for him to see with
    any distinctness the reflection of the meat. The version which
    represents him as crossing a bridge is certainly more consistent
    with nature.]


FABLE V.

THE COW, THE SHE-GOAT, THE SHEEP, AND THE LION.

An alliance with the powerful is never to be relied upon: the present
Fable testifies the truth of my maxim.

A Cow, a She-Goat, and a Sheep[6] patient under injuries, were partners
in the forests with a Lion. When they had captured a Stag of vast bulk,
thus spoke the Lion, after it had been divided into shares: "Because my
name is Lion, I take the first; the second you will yield to me because
I am courageous; then, because I am the strongest,[7] the third will
fall to my lot; if anyone touches the fourth, woe betide him."

Thus did unscrupulousness seize upon the whole prey for itself.

    [Footnote I.6: _And a Sheep_)--Ver. 3. Lessing also censures
    this Fable on the ground of the partnership being contrary to
    nature; neither the cow, the goat, nor the sheep feed on flesh.]

    [Footnote I.7: _I am the strongest_)--Ver. 9. Some critics
    profess to see no difference between "sum fortis" in the eighth
    line, and "plus valeo" here; but the former expression appears to
    refer to his courage, and the latter to his strength. However, the
    second and third reasons are nothing but reiterations of the first
    one, under another form. Davidson remarks on this passage: "I am
    not certain that the Poet meant any distinction; nay, there is,
    perhaps, a propriety in supposing that he industriously makes the
    Lion plead twice upon the same title, to represent more strongly
    by what unjust claims men in power often invade the property of
    another."]


FABLE VI.

THE FROGS' COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SUN.

Æsop, on seeing the pompous wedding of a thief, who was his neighbour,
immediately began to relate the following story:

Once on a time, when the Sun was thinking of taking a wife,[8] the Frogs
sent forth their clamour to the stars. Disturbed by their croakings,
Jupiter asked the cause of their complaints. Then {said} one of the
inhabitants of the pool: "As it is, by himself he parches up all the
standing waters, and compels us unfortunates to languish and die in
{our} scorched abode. What is to become of us, if he beget children?"

    [Footnote I.8: _Taking a wife_)--Ver. 3. It has been suggested
    by Brotier and Desbillons, that in this Fable Phædrus covertly
    alludes to the marriage which was contemplated by Livia, or
    Livilla, the daughter of the elder Drusus and Antonia, and the
    wife of her first-cousin, the younger Drusus, with the infamous
    Sejanus, the minister and favourite of Tiberius, after having,
    with his assistance, removed her husband by poison. In such case,
    the Frogs will represent the Roman people, the Sun Sejanus, who
    had greatly oppressed them, and by Jupiter, Tiberius will be
    meant.]


FABLE VII.

THE FOX AND THE TRAGIC MASK.

A Fox, by chance, casting his eyes on a Tragic Mask: "Ah," said she,
"great as is its beauty, still it has no brains."[9]

This is meant for those to whom fortune has granted honor and renown,
leaving them void of common sense.

    [Footnote I.9: _Has no brains_)--Ver. 2. To make the sense of
    this remark of the Fox the more intelligible, we must bear in mind
    that the ancient masks covered the whole head, and sometimes
    extended down to the shoulders; consequently, their resemblance to
    the human head was much more striking than in the masks of the
    present day.]


FABLE VIII.

THE WOLF AND THE CRANE.

He who expects a recompense for his services from the dishonest commits
a twofold mistake; first, because he assists the undeserving, and in the
next place, because he cannot be gone while he is yet safe.

A bone that he had swallowed stuck in the jaws of a Wolf. Thereupon,
overcome by extreme pain, he began to tempt all and sundry by great
rewards to extract the cause of misery. At length, on his taking an
oath, a Crane was prevailed on, and, trusting the length of her neck to
his throat, she wrought, with danger to herself, a cure for the Wolf.
When she demanded the promised reward for this {service}, "You are an
ungrateful one," replied {the Wolf}, "to have taken your head in safety
out of my mouth, and {then} to ask for a reward."


FABLE IX.

THE SPARROW AND THE HARE.

Let us show, in a few lines, that it is unwise to be heedless[10] of
ourselves, while we are giving advice to others.

A Sparrow upbraided a Hare that had been pounced upon by an Eagle, and
was sending forth piercing cries. "Where now," said he, "is that
fleetness for which you are so remarkable? Why were your feet {thus}
tardy?" While he was speaking, a Hawk seizes him unawares, and kills
him, shrieking aloud with vain complaints. The Hare, almost dead, as a
consolation in his agony, {exclaimed}: "You, who so lately, free from
care, were ridiculing my misfortunes, have now to deplore your own fate
with as woful cause."

    [Footnote I.10: _To be heedless_)--Ver. 1. "Cavere" is a word
    of legal signification, meaning to give advice to a person by way
    of assistance or precaution, as a patron to his client.]


FABLE X.

THE WOLF, THE FOX, AND THE APE.

Whoever has once become notorious by base fraud, even if he speaks the
truth, gains no belief. To this, a short Fable of Æsop bears witness.

A Wolf indicted a Fox upon a charge of theft; the latter denied that she
was amenable to the charge. Upon this, the Ape sat as judge between
them; and when each of them had pleaded his cause, the Ape is said to
have pronounced {this} sentence: "You, {Wolf}, appear not to have lost
what you demand; I believe that you, {Fox}, have stolen what you so
speciously deny."


FABLE XI.

THE ASS AND THE LION HUNTING.

A dastard, who in his talk brags of his prowess, and is devoid of
courage,[11] imposes upon strangers, but is the jest of all who know
him.

A Lion having resolved to hunt in company with an Ass, concealed him in
a thicket, and at the same time enjoined him to frighten the wild beasts
with his voice, to which they were unused, while he himself was to catch
them as they fled. Upon this, Long-ears, with all his might, suddenly
raised a cry, and terrified the beasts with {this} new cause of
astonishment.[12] While, in their alarm, they are flying to the
well-known outlets, they are overpowered by the dread onset of the Lion;
who, after he was wearied with slaughter, called forth the Ass {from his
retreat}, and bade him cease his clamour. On this the other, in his
insolence, {inquired}: "What think you of the assistance given by my
voice?" "Excellent!" said {the Lion}, "so much so, that if I had not
been acquainted with your spirit and your race, I should have fled in
alarm like {the rest}."

    [Footnote I.11: _Devoid of courage_)--Ver. 1. Burmann suggests,
    with great probability, that Phædrus had here in mind those
    braggart warriors, who have been so well described by Plautus and
    Terence, under the characters of Pyrgopolynices and Thraso.]

    [Footnote I.12: _This new cause of astonishment_)--Ver. 8. Never
    having heard the voice of an ass in the forests before.]


FABLE XII.

THE STAG AT THE STREAM.

This story shows that what you contemn is often found of more utility
than what you load with praises.

A Stag, when he had drunk at a stream, stood still, and gazed upon his
likeness in the water. While there, in admiration, he was praising his
branching horns, and finding fault with the extreme thinness of his
legs, suddenly roused by the cries of the huntsmen, he took to flight
over the plain, and with nimble course escaped the dogs. Then a wood
received the beast; in which, being entangled and caught by his horns,
the dogs began to tear him to pieces with savage bites. While dying, he
is said to have uttered these words: "Oh, how unhappy am I, who now too
late find out how useful to me were the things that I despised; and what
sorrow the things I used to praise, have caused me."


FABLE XIII.

THE FOX AND THE RAVEN.

He who is delighted at being flattered with artful words, {generally}
pays the ignominious penalty of a late repentance.

As a Raven, perched in a lofty tree, was about to eat a piece of cheese,
stolen from a window,[13] a Fox espied him, {and} thereupon began thus
to speak: "O Raven, what a glossiness there is upon those feathers of
yours! What grace you carry in your shape and air! If you had a voice,
no bird whatever would be superior to you." On this, the other, while,
in his folly, attempting to show off his voice, let fall the cheese from
his mouth, which the crafty Fox with greedy teeth instantly snatched up.
Then, too late, the Raven, thus, in his stupidity overreached, heaved a
bitter sigh.

By this story[14] it is shown, how much ingenuity avails, {and} how
wisdom is always an overmatch for strength.

    [Footnote I.13: _From a window_)--Ver. 3. Burmann suggests
    that the window of a house in which articles of food were exposed
    for sale, is probably meant.]

    [Footnote I.14: _By this story_)--Ver. 13. Heinsius thinks
    this line and the next to be spurious; because, though Phædrus
    sometimes at the beginning mentions the design of his Fable, he
    seldom does so at the end. In this conjecture he is followed by
    Bentley, Sanadon, and many others of the learned.]


FABLE XIV.

THE COBBLER TURNED PHYSICIAN.

A bungling Cobbler, broken down by want, having begun to practise physic
in a strange place, and selling his antidote[15] under a feigned name,
gained some reputation for himself by his delusive speeches.

Upon this, the King of the city, who lay ill, being afflicted with a
severe malady, asked for a cup, for the purpose of trying him; and then
pouring water into it, and pretending that he was mixing poison with the
fellow's antidote, ordered him to drink it off, {in consideration of} a
stated reward. Through fear of death, the cobbler then confessed that
not by any skill in the medical art, but through the stupidity of the
public, he had gained his reputation. The King, having summoned a
council, thus remarked: "What think you of the extent of your madness,
when you do not hesitate to trust your lives[16] to one to whom no one
would trust his feet to be fitted with shoes?"

This, I should say with good reason, is aimed at those through whose
folly impudence makes a profit.

    [Footnote I.15: _Selling his antidote_)--Ver. 3. "Antidotum"
    probably means a universal remedy, capable of curing all natural
    diseases, as well as neutralizing the effects of poison.]

    [Footnote I.16: _Trust your lives_)--Ver. 15. He seems to pun
    upon the word "capita," as meaning not only "the life," but "the
    head," in contradistinction to "the feet," mentioned in the next
    line. As in l. 2 we find that he came to a place where he was not
    known, we must suppose that the Cobbler confessed to the King his
    former calling.]


FABLE XV.

THE ASS AND THE OLD SHEPHERD.

In a change of government, the poor change nothing beyond the name of
their master. That this is the fact this little Fable shows.

A timorous Old Man was feeding an Ass in a meadow. Frightened by a
sudden alarm of the enemy, he tried to persuade the Ass to fly, lest
they should be taken prisoners. But he leisurely replied: "Pray, do you
suppose that the conqueror will place double panniers upon me?" The Old
Man said, "No." "Then what matters it to me, so long as I have to carry
my panniers, whom I serve?"


FABLE XVI.

THE STAG, THE SHEEP, AND THE WOLF.

When a rogue offers his name as surety in a doubtful case, he has no
design to act straight-forwardly, but is looking to mischief.

A Stag asked a Sheep for a measure[17] of wheat, a Wolf being his
surety. The other, however, suspecting fraud, {replied}: "The Wolf has
always been in the habit of plundering and absconding; you, of rushing
out of sight with rapid flight: where am I to look for you both when the
day comes?"[18]

    [Footnote I.17: _For a measure_)--Ver. 3. Properly "modius;"
    the principal dry measure of the Romans. It was equal to one-third
    of the amphora, and therefore to nearly two gallons English.]

    [Footnote I.18: _Day comes_)--Ver. 6. "Quum dies adveniat,"
    a law term, signifying "when the day of payment comes."]


FABLE XVII.

THE SHEEP, THE DOG, AND THE WOLF.

Liars generally[19] pay the penalty of their guilt.

A Dog, who was a false accuser, having demanded of a Sheep a loaf of
bread, which he affirmed he had entrusted to her charge; a Wolf,
summoned as a witness, affirmed that not only one was owing but ten.
Condemned on false testimony, the Sheep had to pay what she did not owe.
A few days after, the Sheep saw the Wolf lying in a pit. "This," said
she, "is the reward of villany, sent by the Gods."

    [Footnote I.19: _Liars generally_)--Ver. 1. It is supposed by
    some that this Fable is levelled against the informers who
    infested Rome in the days of Tiberius.]


FABLE XVIII.

THE WOMAN IN LABOUR.

No one returns with good will to the place which has done him a
mischief.

Her months completed,[20] a Woman in labour lay upon the ground,
uttering woful moans. Her Husband entreated her to lay her body on the
bed, where she might with more ease deposit her ripe burden. "I feel far
from confident," said she, "that my pains can end in the place where
they originated."

    [Footnote I.20: _Her months completed_)--Ver. 2. Plutarch
    relates this, not as a Fable, but as a true narrative.]


FABLE XIX.

THE BITCH AND HER WHELPS.

The fair words of a wicked man are fraught with treachery, and the
subjoined lines warn us to shun them.

A Bitch, ready to whelp,[21] having entreated another that she might
give birth to her offspring in her kennel, easily obtained the favour.
Afterwards, on the other asking for her place back again, she renewed
her entreaties, earnestly begging for a short time, until she might be
enabled to lead forth her whelps when they had gained sufficient
strength. This time being also expired, {the other} began more urgently
to press for her abode: "If" said {the tenant}, "you can be a match for
me and my litter, I will depart from the place."

    [Footnote I.21: _Ready to whelp_)--Ver. 3. Justin, B. I.,
    c. 3, mentions this Fable with some little variation, as being
    related by a Ligurian to Comanus, the son of King Nannus, who had
    granted (about B.C. 540) some land to the Phocæans for the
    foundation of the city of Massilia; signifying thereby that the
    natives would be quickly dispossessed by the newcomers.]


FABLE XX.

THE HUNGRY DOGS.

An ill-judged project is not only without effect, but also lures mortals
to their destruction.

Some Dogs espied a raw hide sunk in a river. In order that they might
more easily get it out and devour it, they fell to drinking up the
water; they burst, however, and perished before they could reach what
they sought.


FABLE XXI.

THE AGED LION, THE WILD BOAR, THE BULL, AND THE ASS.

Whoever has fallen from a previous high estate, is in his calamity the
butt even of cowards.

As a Lion, worn out with years, and deserted by his strength, lay
drawing his last breath, a Wild Boar came up to him, with flashing
tusks,[22] and with a blow revenged an old affront. Next, with hostile
horns, a Bull pierced the body of his foe. An Ass, on seeing the wild
beast maltreated with impunity, tore up his forehead with his heels. On
this, expiring, he {said}: "I have borne, with indignation, the insults
of the brave; but in being inevitably forced to bear with you, disgrace
to nature! I seem to die a double death."

    [Footnote I.22: _With flashing tusks_)--Ver. 5. "Fulmineus,"
    "lightning-like," is an epithet given by Ovid and Statius also, to
    the tusks of the wild boar; probably by reason of their sharpness
    and the impetuosity of the blow inflicted thereby. Scheffer
    suggests that they were so called from their white appearance
    among the black hair of the boar's head.]


FABLE XXII.

THE MAN AND THE WEASEL.

A Weasel, on being caught by a Man, wishing to escape impending death:
"Pray," said she, "do spare me, for 'tis I who keep your house clear of
troublesome mice." The Man made answer: "If you did so for my sake, it
would be a reason for thanking you, {and} I should have granted you the
pardon you entreat. But, inasmuch as you do your best that you may enjoy
the scraps which they would have gnawed, and devour the mice as well,
don't think of placing your pretended services to my account;" and so
saying, he put the wicked {creature} to death.

Those persons ought to recognize this as applicable to themselves, whose
object is private advantage, and who boast to the unthinking of an
unreal merit.


FABLE XXIII.

THE FAITHFUL DOG.

The man who becomes liberal all of a sudden, gratifies the foolish, but
for the wary spreads his toils in vain.

A Thief one night threw a crust of bread to a Dog, to try whether he
could be gained by the proffered victuals: "Hark you," said the Dog, "do
you think to stop my tongue so that I may not bark for my master's
property? You are greatly mistaken. For this sudden liberality bids me
be on the watch, that you may not profit by my neglect."


FABLE XXIV.

THE FROG AND THE OX.

The needy man, while affecting to imitate the powerful, comes to ruin.

Once on a time, a Frog espied an Ox in a meadow, and moved with envy at
his vast bulk, puffed out her wrinkled skin, {and} then asked her young
ones whether she was bigger than the Ox. They said "No." Again, with
still greater efforts, she distended her skin, and in like manner
enquired which was the bigger:[23] they said: "The Ox." At last, while,
full of indignation, she tried, with all her might, to puff herself out,
she burst her body on the spot.

    [Footnote I.23: _Which was the bigger_)--Ver. 8. "Quis major
    esset. Illi dixerunt Bovem." Bentley censures this line, and
    thinks it spurious. In good Latin, he says "uter" would occupy the
    place of "quis," and "bovem" would be replaced by "bos."]


FABLE XXV.

THE DOG AND THE CROCODILE.

Those who give bad advice to discreet persons, both lose their pains,
and are laughed to scorn.

It has been related,[24] that Dogs drink at the river Nile running
along, that they may not be seized by the Crocodiles. Accordingly, a Dog
having begun to drink while running along, a Crocodile thus addressed
him: "Lap as leisurely as you like; drink on; come nearer, and don't be
afraid," said he. The other {replied}: "Egad, I would do so with all my
heart, did I not know that you are eager for my flesh."

    [Footnote I.24: _It has been related_)--Ver. 3. Pliny, in his
    Natural History, B. viii. c. 40, and Ælian, in his Various and
    Natural Histories, relate the same fact as to the dogs drinking of
    the Nile. "To treat a thing, as the dogs do the Nile," was a
    common proverb with the ancients, signifying to do it
    superficially; corresponding with our homely saying, "To give it a
    lick and a promise." Macrobius, in the Saturnalia, B. i. c. 2,
    mentions a story, that after the defeat at Mutina, when enquiry
    was made as to what had become of Antony, one of his servants made
    answer: "He has done what the dogs do in Egypt, he drank and ran
    away."


FABLE XXVI.

THE FOX AND THE STORK.

Harm should be done to no man; but if any one do an injury, this Fable
shows that he may be visited with a like return.

A Fox is said to have given a Stork the first invitation to a banquet,
and to have placed before her some thin broth in a flat dish, of which
the hungry Stork could in no way get a taste. Having invited the Fox in
return, she set {before him} a narrow-mouthed jar,[25] full of minced
meat:[26] and, thrusting her beak into it, satisfied herself, {while}
she tormented her guest with hunger; who, after having in vain licked
the neck of the jar, as we have heard, thus addressed the foreign
bird:[27] "Every one is bound to bear patiently the results of his own
example."

    [Footnote I.25: _Of minced meat_)--Ver. 7. "Intritus cibus,"
    is thought here to signify a peculiar dish, consisting of bread
    soaked in milk, cheese, garlic, and other herbs.]

    [Footnote I.26: _Narrow-mouthed jar_)--Ver. 8. The "lagena,"
    or "lagona," was a long-necked bottle or flagon, made of earth,
    and much used for keeping wine or fruit.]

    [Footnote I.27: _The foreign bird_)--Ver. 11. Alluding
    probably to the migratory habits of the stork, or the fact of her
    being especially a native of Egypt.]


FABLE XXVII.

THE DOG, THE TREASURE, AND THE VULTURE.

This Fable may be applied to the avaricious, and to those, who, born to
a humble lot, affect to be called rich.

Grubbing up human bones,[28] a Dog met with a Treasure; and, because he
had offended the Gods the Manes,[29] a desire for riches was inspired in
him, that so he might pay the penalty {due} to the holy character of the
place. Accordingly, while he was watching over the gold, forgetful of
food, he was starved to death; on which a Vulture, standing over him, is
reported to have said: "O Dog, you justly meet your death, who, begotten
at a cross-road, and bred up on a dunghill, have suddenly coveted regal
wealth."

    [Footnote I.28: _Human bones_)--Ver. 3. This plainly refers to
    the custom which prevailed among the ancients, of burying golden
    ornaments, and even money, with the dead; which at length was
    practised to such an excess, that at Rome the custom was forbidden
    by law. It was probably practised to a great extent by the people
    of Etruria; if we may judge from the discoveries of golden
    ornaments frequently made in their tombs.]

    [Footnote I.29: _Gods the Manes_)--Ver. 4. Perhaps by "Deos
    Manes" are meant the good and bad Genii of the deceased.]


FABLE XXVIII.

THE FOX AND THE EAGLE.

Men, however high in station, ought to be on their guard against the
lowly; because, to ready address, revenge lies near at hand.

An Eagle one day carried off the whelps of a Fox, and placed them in
{her} nest before her young ones, for them to tear in pieces as food.
The mother, following her, began to entreat that she would not cause
such sorrow to her miserable {suppliant}. The other despised her, as
being safe in the very situation of the spot. The Fox snatched from an
altar a burning torch, and surrounded the whole tree with flames,
intending to mingle anguish to her foe with the loss of her offspring.
The Eagle, that she might rescue her young ones from the peril of death,
in a suppliant manner restored to the Fox her whelps in safety.


FABLE XXIX.

THE ASS DERIDING THE BOAR.

Fools often, while trying to raise a silly laugh, provoke others by
gross affronts, and cause serious danger to themselves.

An Ass meeting a Boar: "Good morrow to you, brother," says he. The other
indignantly rejects the salutation, and enquires why he thinks proper to
utter such an untruth. The Ass, with legs[30] crouching down, replies:
"If you deny that you are like me, at all events I have something very
like your snout." The Boar, just on the point of making a fierce attack,
suppressed his rage, and {said}: "Revenge were easy for me, but I
decline to be defiled with {such} dastardly blood."

    [Footnote I.30: _The ass, with legs_)--Ver. 7. This line is
    somewhat modified in the translation.]


FABLE XXX.

THE FROGS FRIGHTENED AT THE BATTLE OF THE BULLS.

When the powerful[31] are at variance, the lowly are the sufferers.

A Frog, viewing from a marsh, a combat of some Bulls: "Alas!" said she,
"what terrible destruction is threatening us." Being asked by another
why she said so, as the Bulls were contending for the sovereignty of the
herd, and passed their lives afar from them: "Their habitation is at a
distance," {said she}, "and they are of a different kind; still, he who
{is} expelled from the sovereignty of the meadow, will take to flight,
{and} come to the secret hiding-places in the fens, and trample and
crush us with his hard hoof. Thus does their fury concern our safety."

    [Footnote I.31: _When the powerful_)--Ver. 1. This is similar
    to the line of Horace, "Quicquid delirant reges, plectuntur
    Achivi."]


FABLE XXXI.

THE KITE AND THE PIGEONS.

He who entrusts himself to the protection of a wicked man, while he
seeks assistance, meets with destruction.

Some Pigeons, having often escaped from a Kite, and by their swiftness
of wing avoided death, the spoiler had recourse to stratagem, and by a
crafty device of this nature, deceived the harmless race. "Why do you
prefer to live a life of anxiety, rather than conclude a treaty, and
make me {your} king, who can ensure your safety from every injury?"
They, putting confidence in him, entrusted themselves to the Kite, who,
on obtaining the sovereignty, began to devour them one by one, and to
exercise authority with his cruel talons. Then said one of those that
were left: "Deservedly are we smitten."
