BOOK V.


PROLOGUE.

If I shall anywhere insert the name of Æsop, to whom I have already
rendered every {honor} that was his due, know that it is for the sake of
{his} authority, just as some statuaries do in our day, who obtain a
much greater price for their productions, if they inscribe the name of
Praxiteles on their marbles, and Myron[1] on their polished silver.
{Therefore} let {these} Fables obtain a hearing. Carping envy more
readily favours the works of antiquity than those of the present day.
But now I turn to a Fable, with a moral to the purpose.

    [Footnote V.1: _And Myron_)--Ver. 7. Myron was a famous
    sculptor, statuary, and engraver, of Greece. He was a native of
    Eleutheræ, in Boeotia, and according to Petronius Arbiter, died in
    extreme poverty.]


FABLE I.

DEMETRIUS AND MENANDER.

Demetrius,[2] who was called Phalereus, unjustly took possession of the
sovereignty of Athens. The mob, according to their usual practice, rush
from all quarters vying with each other, and cheer him, and wish him
joy. Even the chief men kiss the hand by which they are oppressed, while
they silently lament the sad vicissitudes of fortune. Moreover, those
who live in retirement, and take their ease, come creeping in last of
all, that their absence may not injure them. Among these Menander,
famous[3] for his Comedies (which Demetrius, who did not know him, had
read, and had admired the genius of the man), perfumed with unguents,
and clad in a flowing robe, came with a mincing and languid step. As
soon as the Tyrant caught sight of him at the end of the train: "What
effeminate wretch," said he, "is this, who presumes to come into my
presence?" Those near him made answer: "This is Menander the Poet."
Changed in an instant, he exclaimed: "A more agreeable looking man could
not possibly exist."

    [Footnote V.2: _Called Phalereus_)--Ver. 1. Demetrius
    Phalereus, the statesman, philosopher, and ruler of Athens, was so
    called from the Attic demus, or borough of Phalerus, where he was
    born. He died in exile in Egypt, according to some accounts, of
    the bite of a serpent. There seems no good reason for giving to
    his rule over the Athenians the epithet of "improbum," found in
    the next line, although in the latter years of his government he
    gave himself up in a great measure to sensual pursuits.]

    [Footnote V.3: _Menander, famous_)--Ver. 9. Menander, the
    inventor of the New Comedy. Some of the Comedies of Terence are
    Translations from his works.]


FABLE II.

THE TRAVELLERS AND THE ROBBER.

Two Soldiers having fallen in with a Robber, one fled, while the other
stood his ground, and defended himself with a stout right-hand. The
Robber slain, his cowardly companion comes running up, and draws his
sword; then throwing back his travelling cloak,[4] says: "Let's have
him;" "I'll take care he shall soon know whom he attacks." On this, he
who had vanquished {the robber made answer}: "I wish you had seconded me
just now at least with those words; I should have been still more
emboldened, believing them true; now keep your sword quiet, as well as
your silly tongue, that you may be able to deceive others who don't know
you. I, who have experienced with what speed you take to your heels,
know full well that no dependence is to be placed upon your valour."

This story may be applied to him who is courageous in prosperity, in
times of danger takes to flight.

    [Footnote V.4: _His travelling cloak_)--Ver. 5. The "pænula"
    was a travelling-cloak made of leather or wool, with a hood
    attached to it, to cover the head.]


FABLE III.

THE BALD MAN AND THE FLY.

A Fly bit the bare pate of a Bald Man; who, endeavouring to crush it,
gave himself a heavy blow. Then said the Fly jeeringly: "You wanted to
revenge the sting of a tiny insect with death; what will you do to
yourself, who have added insult to injury?" {The Man} made answer: "I am
easily reconciled to myself, because I know that there was no intention
of doing harm. But you, worthless insect, and one of a contemptible
race, who take a delight in drinking human blood, I could wish to
destroy you, even at a heavier penalty."

This Fable teaches that pardon is to be granted to him who errs through
mistake. But him who is designedly mischievous, I deem to be deserving
of {any} punishment.


FABLE IV.

THE MAN AND THE ASS.

A Man having sacrificed a young boar to the god Hercules, to whom he
owed performance of a vow {made} for the preservation of his health,
ordered the remains of the barley to be set for the Ass. But he refused
{to touch it}, and said: "I would most willingly accept your food, if he
who had been fed upon it had not had his throat cut."

Warned by the significance of this Fable, I have always been careful to
avoid the gain that exposed to hazard. "But," say you, "those who have
got riches by rapine, are {still} in possession of them." Come, then,
let us enumerate those, who, being detected, have come to a bad end; you
will find that those {so} punished constitute a great majority.

Rashness brings luck to a few, misfortune to most.


FABLE V.

THE BUFFOON AND THE COUNTRYMAN.

Men are in the habit of erring through prejudice; and while they stand
up in defence of their erroneous notions, {are wont} to be driven by
plain facts to confession of their mistakes.

A rich Man, about to entertain the people with grand shows, invited all,
by the promise of a reward, to exhibit whatever new piece of ingenuity
any one could. The Performers came to the contest for fame, among whom a
Buffoon, well known for his drollery, said that he had a kind of
entertainment which had never yet been brought out at {any} theatre. The
rumour, spreading, brought together the {whole} city; and the places,
empty shortly before, sufficed not for the multitude. But as soon as he
appeared on the stage, alone, {and} without any apparatus, any
stage-assistants, the very intenseness of expectation produced silence.
Suddenly, he dropped down his head towards his bosom, and so well did he
imitate the voice of a pig with his own, that they concluded there was a
real one under his cloak, and ordered it to be shaken out. This being
done, as soon as they found that nothing was discovered, they loaded the
Man with many praises, and bestowed upon him the greatest applause.

A Countryman seeing this take place: "Egad," said he, "he shan't surpass
me;" and immediately gave out that he would do the same thing still
better on the following day. A still greater crowd assembled. Prejudice
had already taken possession of their minds, and they took their seats,
determined to deride, and not as {unbiassed} spectators. Both Performers
come forth. First, the Buffoon grunts away, and excites their applause,
and awakens their acclamations. Next, the Countryman, pretending that he
concealed a pig beneath his clothes (which, in fact, he did; but quite
unsuspected, because they had found none about the other), twitched the
ear of the real {pig}, which he was concealing, and with the pain forced
from it its natural cry. The people shouted with one voice that the
Buffoon had given a much more exact imitation, and ordered the
Countryman to be driven from the stage. On this, he produced the pig
itself from the folds of his cloak, and convicting them of their
disgraceful mistake by a manifest proof: "Look," said {he}, "this shows
what sort of judges you are."


FABLE VI.

THE TWO BALD MEN.

A Bald Man chanced to find a comb in the public road. Another, equally
destitute of hair, came up: "Come," said he, "shares, whatever it is you
have found." The other showed the booty, and added withal: "The will of
the Gods has favoured us, but through the malignity of fate, we have
found, as the saying is, a coal instead of a treasure."

This complaint befits him whom hope has disappointed.


FABLE VII.

PRINCEPS, THE FLUTE-PLAYER.

When a weak mind, beguiled by frivolous applause, has once given way to
insolent self-sufficiency, {such} foolish vanity is easily exposed to
ridicule.

Princeps, the Flute-player, was pretty well known, being accustomed to
accompany Bathyllus[5] with his music on the stage. It chanced that, at
a representation, I don't well remember what it was, while the
flying-machine[6] was being whirled along, he fell heavily, through
inadvertence, and broke his left leg, when he would much rather have
parted with two right ones.[7] He was picked up and carried to his house
groaning aloud. Some months pass by before his cure is completed. As is
the way with the spectators, for {they are} a merry race, the man began
to be missed, by whose blasts the vigour of the dancer was wont to be
kept at full stretch.

A certain Nobleman was about to exhibit a show, just when Princeps was
beginning to walk abroad. With a present {and} entreaties he prevailed
upon him merely to present himself on the day of the show. When the day
came a rumour about the Flute-player ran through the theatre. Some
affirmed that he was dead, some that he would appear before them without
delay. The curtain falling,[8] the thunders rolled,[9] and the Gods
conversed in the usual form. At this moment the Chorus struck up a song
unknown to him who had so recently returned; of which the burthen was
this: "Rejoice, Rome, in security, for your prince [{Princeps}] is
well." All rise with one consent and applaud. The Flute-player kisses
hands, {and} imagines that his friends are congratulating him. The
Equestrian order perceive the ridiculous mistake, and with loud laughter
encore the song. It is repeated. My man {now} throws himself {sprawling}
at full length upon the stage.[10] Ridiculing him, the Knights applaud;
while the people fancy he is {only} asking for a chaplet. When, however,
the reality came to be known throughout all the tiers, Princeps, his leg
bound up with a snow-white fillet, clad in snow-white tunic, {and}
snow-white shoes,[11] while pluming himself on the honors really paid to
the Deified House,[12] was thrust out headlong by common consent.

    [Footnote V.5: _Accompany Bathyllus_)--Ver. 5. He alludes to
    Bathyllus, the favourite and freedman of Mecænas, and who brought
    to perfection pantomimic dancing at Rome.]

    [Footnote V.6: _Flying-machine_)--Ver. 7. The "pegma" was a
    piece of machinery used on the stage for the purpose of aiding the
    ascents and descents of the Gods there represented.]

    [Footnote V.7: _Losing two right ones_)--Ver. 9. The Poet puns
    on the twofold meanings of the word "tibia," which signifies the
    main bone of the leg, and a pipe or flute. These pipes were
    right-handed or left-handed, probably varying in tone, two being
    played at a time. Explained at length, the pun means, "Princeps
    broke his left leg, when he could have better afforded to break
    two right-handed pipes."]

    [Footnote V.8: _The curtain falling_)--Ver. 23. The "aulæum,"
    or stage-curtain, called also "siparium," was a piece of tapestry
    stretched on a frame, which, rising before the stage, concealed it
    till the actors appeared. Instead of drawing up this curtain to
    discover the stage and actors, according to the present practice,
    it was depressed when the play began, and fell beneath the level
    of the stage: whence "aulæa premuntur" or "mittuntur," "the
    curtain is dropped," meant that the play had began.]

    [Footnote V.9: _The thunders rolled_)--Ver. 23. This thunder
    was made by the noise of rolling stones in copper vessels.]

    [Footnote V.10: _Upon the stage_)--Ver. 32. The "pulpitum" was
    properly an elevated place on the proscenium, or space between the
    scene and the orchestra.]

    [Footnote V.11: _Snow-white shoes_)--Ver. 37. We learn from
    Ovid and other authors that white shoes were solely worn by the
    female sex.]

    [Footnote V.12: _To the Deified house_)--Ver. 38. Taking to
    himself the honor that belonged to the house of Augustus, which
    was worshipped with Divine honors.]


FABLE VIII.

THE EMBLEM OF OPPORTUNITY.

A Bald Man, balancing on a razor's edge, fleet of foot, his forehead
covered with hair,[13] his body naked--if you have caught him, hold him
fast; when he has once escaped, not Jupiter himself can overtake him: he
is the emblem how shortlived is Opportunity.

The ancients devised such a portraiture of Time, {to signify} that
slothful delay should not hinder the execution of our purposes.

    [Footnote V.13: _His forehead covered with hair_)--Ver. 2.
    From this figure of Time or Opportunity, Time came to be
    represented in the middle ages with a tuft of hair on his
    forehead; whence our common expression "To take time by the
    forelock," signifying to make the best of an opportunity.]


FABLE IX.

THE BULL AND THE CALF.

When a Bull was struggling with his horns in a narrow passage, and could
hardly effect an entrance to the manger, a Calf began to point out in
what way he might turn himself: "Hush," said {the Bull}, "I knew that
before you were born."

Let him who would instruct a wiser man, consider {this as} said to
himself.


FABLE X.

THE HUNTSMAN AND THE DOG.

A Dog, who had always given satisfaction to his master by his boldness
against swift and savage beasts, began to grow feeble under increasing
years. On one occasion, being urged to the combat with a bristling Boar,
he seized him by the ear; but, through the rottenness of his teeth, let
go his prey. Vexed at this, the Huntsman upbraided the Dog. Old
Barker[14] {replied}: "It is not my courage that disappoints you, but my
strength. You commend me for what I have been; and you blame me that I
am not {what I was}."

You, Philetus,[15] may easily perceive why I have written this.

    [Footnote V.14: _Old Barker_)--Ver. 7. We may here enumerate
    the names of this nature, which we find given by Phædrus to
    various animals: "laniger," "wool-bearer," the sheep; "auritulus,"
    "long-ears," the ass; "sonipes," "sounding-hoof," the horse;
    "barbatus," "long-beard," the goat; "retorridus," "brindle," the
    mouse; and "latrans," "barker," the dog.]

    [Footnote V.15: _Philetus._)--Ver. 10. Of this Philetus
    nothing certain is known, but he is supposed to have been a
    freedman of the emperor Claudius.]


THE NEW FABLES,

BY SOME ATTRIBUTED TO PHÆDRUS.[1]

    [Footnote NF.1: _Attributed to Phædrus_)--Cassito and
    Jannelli, with several other critics, are strongly of opinion that
    these Fables were written by Phædrus. On a critical examination,
    however, they will be found to be so dissimilar in style and
    language from those acknowledged to be by Phædrus, that it is very
    difficult not to come to the conclusion that they are the work of
    some more recent writer, of inferior genius, and less pure
    latinity. They were first published in 1809, at Naples, by
    Cassito, from a MS. which had belonged to Nicholas Perotti,
    Archbishop of Sipontum or Manfredonia, at the end of the fifteenth
    century, and who, notwithstanding his assertions to the contrary,
    was perhaps either the author of them or altered them very
    materially. They appear in the MSS. in a mutilated condition; and
    the lacunæ have been filled up according to the fancy of the
    successive Editors of the Fables. Those inserted in Gail's edition
    have in general been here adopted.]


FABLE I.

THE APE AND THE FOX.

_The Greedy Man is not willing to give even from his superabundance._

An Ape asked a Fox for a part of her tail, that he might decently cover
his naked hinder parts therewith; but the ill-natured creature
{replied}: "Although it grow {even} longer {than it is}, still I will
sooner drag it through mud and brambles, than give you ever so small a
part {thereof}."


FABLE II.

THE AUTHOR.

_We must not require what is unreasonable._

If Nature had[2] formed the human race according to my notions, it would
have been far better endowed: for she would have given us every good
quality that indulgent Fortune has bestowed on {any} animal: the
strength of the Elephant, and the impetuous force of the Lion, the
age of the Crow, the majestic port of the fierce Bull, the gentle
tractableness of the fleet Horse; and Man should still have had the
ingenuity that is peculiarly his own. Jupiter in heaven laughs to
himself, no doubt, he who, in his mighty plan, denied these {qualities}
to men, lest our audacity should wrest {from him} the sceptre of the
world. Contented, therefore, with the gifts of unconquered Jove, let us
pass the years of our time allotted by fate, nor attempt more than
mortality permits.

    [Footnote NF.2: _If nature had_)--Ver. 1. This can hardly be
    styled a Fable; it is merely an Epilogue or moral lesson.]


FABLE III.

MERCURY AND THE TWO WOMEN.

_Another Fable on the same subject._

Once on a time, two Women had given their guest, Mercury, a mean and
sordid entertainment; one of the women had a little son in the cradle,
while the profession of a Courtesan had its charms for the other. In
order, therefore that he might give a suitable return for their
services, when about to depart, and just crossing the threshold, he
said: "In me you behold a God; I will give you at once whatever each may
wish." The Mother makes her request, and asks that she may immediately
see her Son graced with a beard; the Courtesan {requests} that whatever
she touches may follow her. Mercury flies away--the women return
in-doors: behold the infant, with a beard, is crying aloud. The
Courtesan happened to laugh heartily at this, on which the humours {of
the head} filled her nostrils, as is often the case. Intending therefore
to blow her nose, she seized it with her hand, and drew out its length
to the ground; and {thus}, while laughing at another, she became herself
a subject for laughter.[3]

    [Footnote NF.3: _For laughter_)--Ver. 17. This story savours
    more of the false wit of the middle ages than of the genius of
    Phædrus.]


FABLE IV.

PROMETHEUS AND CUNNING.

_On Truth and Falsehood._

When once Prometheus, the framer of a new race, had formed Truth from
fine earth, that she might be able to dispense justice among mankind,
being suddenly summoned by the messenger of great Jove, he left {his}
workshop in charge of treacherous Cunning, whom he had lately received
in apprenticeship. The latter, inflamed by zeal, with clever hand formed
an image of similar appearance, corresponding stature, and like in every
limb, so far as the time permitted. When nearly the whole had now been
wondrously set up, he found he had no clay to make the feet. {His}
master came back, and Cunning, confused by fear at his quick return, sat
down in his own place. Prometheus, admiring so strong a resemblance,
wished the merit to appear to belong to his own skill, {and} therefore
placed the two images together in the furnace. When they were thoroughly
baked, and life had been breathed into them, hallowed Truth moved on
with modest gait; but her imperfect copy remained fixed on the spot.
Thence the spurious image, the result of the stealthy work, was called
Mendacity,[4] because they say, she has no feet,--an assertion with
which I readily agree.

    [Footnote NF.4: _Was called Mendacity_)--Ver. 21. There is a
    sort of pun intended upon the word "menda," a blemish. Because
    Falsehood was blemished in having no feet, she was called
    "mendacium" or "mendacity." Here the author's etymology is at
    fault, as the word "mendacity" comes from "mentior," to lie; which
    is not likely to have been derived from "menda." Besides,
    Falsehood, whether she has feet or not, generally travels more
    speedily than Truth.]


FABLE V.[5]

THE AUTHOR.

_Nothing is long concealed._

* * * Pretended vices are sometimes profitable to men, but still the
truth appears in time.

    [Footnote NF.5: _Fable V._)--This seems to be only a fragment;
    probably the moral of a Fable now lost.]


FABLE VI.

THE SIGNIFICATION OF THE PUNISHMENTS OF TARTARUS.

_The meaning is to be considered, not the mere words._
