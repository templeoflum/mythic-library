[Transcriber's Note:

This e-text is intended for users whose text readers cannot display
the "real" (Unicode, utf-8) version of the file. Greek words in the
Notes have been transliterated and shown between +marks+. The "oe"
ligature is written as the separate letters "oe".

The text is taken from an omnibus volume that also contained Riley's
translation of the six surviving plays of Terence. The full title page
has been retained for completeness, but the sections of the Preface and
Contents that apply only to Terence have been omitted.

In the original text, words and phrases supplied by the translator
(Riley only) were printed in _italics_. In this e-text they are shown in
{braces}. Italics in the notes and commentary are shown conventionally
with _lines_, boldface by =marks=.

Footnotes have been renumbered within each Book, and grouped after their
Fables. The name is spelled "Æsop" in Riley, "Esop" in Smart and in the
Contents. Inconsistencies in fable numbering are described at the
beginning of the Table of Contents.

Typographical errors are listed at the end of the text.]

  By HENRY THOMAS RILEY, B.A.
  Late Scholar Of Clare Hall, Cambridge.

  A METRICAL TRANSLATION OF PHÆDRUS,

PREFACE.


In the Translation of Phædrus, the Critical Edition by Orellius, 1831,
has been used, and in the Æsopian Fables, the text of the Parisian
Edition of Gail, 1826. The Notes will, it is believed, be found to
embody the little that is known of the contemporary history of the
Author.

CONTENTS.


THE FABLES OF PHÆDRUS.

  [Transcriber's Note:

  The Table of Contents refers primarily to the Riley text. Fables
  I.XXIX, III.III, and several Fables in Book IV are missing in Smart;
  Riley's Fable IV.I, "The Ass and the Priests of Cybele", is Smart's
  III.XIX. Where Smart's numbers are different, they have been added
  in [brackets] after the page reference.

  In the text, Book III, Fable XI is "The Eunuch to the Abusive Man";
  all following fables in Riley are numbered one higher than in the
  Table of Contents. This fable is missing from Smart but the number
  X is skipped, as was number I.XVIII.]
