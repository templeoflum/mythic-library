And we sacrifice to the lights of dawn which are radiant with their light,
 and fleetest horses which sweep over the sevenfold earth....
--Gâh Ushahin, (
p. 387
).
This is part III of the Sacred Books of the East
 Zend Avesta, translated by L.H. Mills, who took up the
 task after James Darmesteter, the translator of the first two parts.
 It includes liturgical material, some of which is almost completely
 unchanged from the earliest period of Zoroastrianism, and still in use today.
 Of great interest are some of the oldest formulations of dualism,
 which later became a core concept of other middle eastern
 religions, including Judaism, and later Christianity.
 Moreover, the texts in this part of the Avesta are
 not so far removed from Vedic-era Hinduism, and as such represent a link
 between the later great Eastern and Western religions.
