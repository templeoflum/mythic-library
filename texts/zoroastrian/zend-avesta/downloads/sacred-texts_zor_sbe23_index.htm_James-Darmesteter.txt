This is part II of the Sacred Books of the East
 Zend Avesta translation.
 This portion of the Avesta is of great interest to the study
 of comparative mythology.
 Many of these are of also of outstanding literary value.
 Many of the texts in this part
 were originally hymns to very ancient gods and goddesses,
 such as
Mithra
,
Anahita
,
 as well as celestial bodies such as the sun, moon and
 the star
Sirius
, Tishtrya.
 These deities were retained in Zoroastrian mythology as demigods,
 somewhat like the Aeons of the Gnostics.
 There are also a number of texts which enumerate a huge body of
 legendary personages, some of whom also appear in the
Shah Nama
,
 the Persian national epic.
Yast XII
is a moving poetic
 description of the Zoroastrian after-death experience.
