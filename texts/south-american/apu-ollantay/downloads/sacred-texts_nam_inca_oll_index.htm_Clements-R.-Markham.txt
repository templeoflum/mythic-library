Text [Zipped]
This is one of the only (if not the only)
 Native American dramatic compositions known.
 It compares favorably with European dramas;
 it also gives a rare look at the
 inner workings of the Inca culture.
 This is the tale of Ollantay, a noble commoner
 who defies the Inca because
 of his love for the princess Cusi Coyllor, and thereby puts the
 empire into a state of rebellion.
 Ollantay combines tragedy and comedy, and has a vivid cast of male
 and female characters.
 This translation by Clements Markham follows the original closely
 and is very readable.
