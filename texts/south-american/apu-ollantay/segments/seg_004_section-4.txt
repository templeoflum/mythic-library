OLLANTAY.
(_aside_)
He sees me. I must speak to him.

(The Uillac Uma comes forward.)

O Uillac Uma, Great High Priest,
I bow before thee with respect
May the skies be clear for thee,
And brightest sunshine meet thine eyes.

UILLAC UMA.
Brave Ollantay! Princely one!
May all the teeming land be thine;
May thy far-reaching arm of might
Reduce the wide-spread universe.

OLLANTAY.
Old man! thine aspect causes fear,
Thy presence here some ill forebodes;
All round thee dead men’s bones appear,
Baskets, flowers, sacrifice.
All men when they see thy face
Are filled with terror and alarm.
What means it all? why comest thou?
It wants some months before the least.
Is it that the Inca is ill?
Perchance hast thou some thought divined
Which soon will turn to flowing blood.
Why comest thou? the Sun’s great day,
The Moon’s libations are not yet
The moon has not yet nearly reached
The solemn time for sacrifice.
Uillac Uma. Why dost thou these questions put,
In tones of anger and reproach?
Am I, forsooth, thy humble slave?
That I know all I’ll quickly prove.

OLLANTAY.
My beating heart is filled with dread,
Beholding thee so suddenly;
Perchance thy coming is a sign,
Of evils overtaking me.

UILLAC UMA.
Fear not, Ollantay! not for that,
The High Priest comes to thee this day.
It is perhaps for love of thee,
That, as a straw is blown by wind,
A friend, this day, encounters thee.
Speak to me as to a friend,
Hide nothing from my scrutiny.
This day I come to offer thee
A last and most momentous choice
’Tis nothing less than life or death.

OLLANTAY.
Then make thy words more clear to me,
That I may understand the choice;
Till now ’tis but a tangled skein,
Unravel it that I may know.

UILLAC UMA.
’Tis well. Now listen, warlike. Chief:
My science has enabled me,
To learn and see all hidden things
Unknown to other mortal men.
My power will enable me
To make of thee a greater prince.
I brought thee up from tender years,
And cherished thee with love and care
I now would guide thee in the right,
And ward off all that threatens thee.
As chief of Anti-suyu now,
The people venerate thy name;
Thy Sovereign trusts and honours thee,
E’en to sharing half his realm.
From all the rest he chose thee out,
And placed all power in thy hands;
He made thy armies great and strong,
And strengthened thee against thy foes
How numerous soe’er they be,
They have been hunted down by thee.
Are these good reasons for thy wish,
To wound thy Sovereign to the heart?
His daughter is beloved by thee;
Thy passion thou wouldst fain indulge,
Lawless and forbidden though it be.
I call upon thee, stop in time,
Tear this folly from thy heart.
If thy passion is immense,
Still let honour hold its place.
You reel, you stagger on the brink
I’d snatch thee from the very edge.
Thou knowest well it cannot be,
The Inca never would consent.
If thou didst e’en propose it now,
He would be overcome with rage;
From favoured prince and trusted chief,
Thou wouldst descend to lowest rank.

OLLANTAY.
How is it that thou canst surely know
What still is hidden in my heart?
Her mother only knows my love,
Yet thou revealest all to me.

UILLAC UMA.
I read thy secret on the moon,
As if upon the Quipu knots;
And what thou wouldst most surely hide,
Is plain to me as all the rest.

OLLANTAY.
In my heart I had divined
That thou wouldst search me through and through
Thou knowest all, O Councillor,
And wilt thou now desert thy son?

UILLAC UMA.
How oft we mortals heedless drink,
A certain death from golden cup
Recall to mind how ills befall,
And that a stubborn heart ’s the cause.

OLLANTAY.
(_kneeling_).
Plunge that dagger in my breast,
Thou holdst it ready in thy belt;
Cut out my sad and broken heart
I ask the favour at thy feet.

UILLAC UMA.
(to Piqui Chaqui).
Gather me that flower, boy.

(Piqui Chaqui gives him a withered flower and lies down again,
pretending to sleep.)
