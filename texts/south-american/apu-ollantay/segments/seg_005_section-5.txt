(To Ollantay).
Behold, it is quite dead and dry.
Once more behold! e’en now it weeps,
It weeps. The water flows from it.

(Water flows out of the flower.)

OLLANTAY.
More easy for the barren rocks
Or for sand to send forth water,
Than that I should cease to love
The fair princess, the joyful star.

UILLAC UMA.
Put a seed into the ground,
It multiplies a hundredfold;
The more thy crime shall grow and swell,
The greater far thy sudden fall.

OLLANTAY.
Once for all, I now confess
To thee, O great and mighty Priest;
Now learn my fault. To thee I speak,
Since thou hast torn it from my heart.
The lasso to tie me is long,
’Tis ready to twist round my throat
Yet its threads are woven with gold,
It avenges a brilliant crime.
Cusi Coyllur e’en now is my wife,
Already we’re bound and are one;
My blood now runs in her veins,
E’en now I am noble as she.
Her mother has knowledge of all,
The Queen can attest what I say;
Let me tell all this to the King,
I pray for thy help and advice.
I will speak without fear and with force,
He may perhaps give way to his rage
Yet he may consider my youth,
May remember the battles I’ve fought;
The record is carved on my club.

(Holds up his macana.)

He may think of his enemies crushed,
The thousands I’ve thrown at his feet.

UILLAC UMA.
Young Prince! thy words are too bold,
Thou hast twisted the thread of thy fate—
Beware, before ’tis too late;
Disentangle and weave it afresh,
Go alone to speak to the King,
Alone bear the blow that you seek;
Above all let thy words be but few,
And say them with deepest respect;
Be it life, be it death that you find,
I will never forget thee, my son.

(Walks up and exit.)

OLLANTAY.
Ollantay, thou art a man,
No place in thy heart for fear;
Cusi Coyllur, surround me with light.
Piqui Chaqui, where art thou?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
(jumping up).
I was asleep, my master,
And dreaming of evil things.

OLLANTAY.
Of what?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Of a fox with a rope round its neck.

OLLANTAY.
Sure enough, thou art the fox.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
It is true that my nose is growing finer,
And my ears a good deal longer.

OLLANTAY.
Come, lead me to the Coyllur.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
It is still daylight.

(Exeunt.)

SCENE 2

A great hall in the Colcampata, then the palace of the Queen or Ccoya
Anahuarqui. In the centre of the back scene a doorway, and seen through
it gardens with the snowy peak of Vilcanota in the distance. Walls
covered with golden slabs. On either side of the doorway three
recesses, with household gods in the shape of maize-cobs and llamas,
and gold vases in them. On R. a golden tiana or throne. On L. two lower
seats covered with cushions of fine woollen cloth.

(ANAHUARQUI, the Queen or Ccoya (in blue chucu, white cotton bodice,
and red mantle secured by a golden topu or pin, set with emeralds, and
a blue skirt), and the princess CUSI COYLLUR (in a chucu, with feathers
of the tunqui, white bodice and skirt, and grey mantle with topu, set
with pearls) discovered seated.)

ANAHUARQUI.
Since when art thou feeling so sad,
Cusi Coyllur! great Inti’s prunelle?[15]
Since when hast thou lost all thy joy,
Thy smile and thy once merry laugh?
Tears of grief now pour down my face,
As I watch and mourn over my child;
Thy grief makes me ready to die.
Thy union filled thee with joy,
Already you’re really his wife.
Is he not the man of thy choice?
O daughter, devotedly loved,
Why plunged in such terrible grief?

(Cusi Coyllur has had her face hidden in the pillows. She now rises to
her feet, throwing up her arms.)
