Thou art all my happiness,
My daughter, come, O come to me;
This joy quite inundates my soul,
It is the name I gave to thee.

YMA SUMAC.
O my mother, to find thee thus!
We must be parted never more.
Do not abandon me in grief.
To whom can I turn to free thee,
To whom can I appeal for right?

PITU SALLA.
Make no noise, my dearest friend.
To find us thus would ruin me.
Let us go. I fear the Mothers.

YMA SUMAC.
(to Cusi Coyllur).
Suffer a short time longer here,
Until I come to take thee hence,
Patience for a few more days.
Alas! my mother dear! I go,
But full of love, to seek for help.

(Exeunt closing the stone door, all but Cusi Coyllur. They extinguish
the torch.)

SCENE 6

Great hall in the palace of Tupac Yupanqui.

(The INCA discovered seated on the tiana. To him enter the UILLAC UMA,
in full dress.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
I greet thee, great and noble Priest!
Hast thou no news of Rumi-ñaui.

UILLAC UMA.
Last night, with guards, I wandered out
On heights towards Uilcanuta.
Far off I saw a crowd in chains,
No doubt the Anti prisoners,v For they are all defeated quite.
The cacti[68] on the mountains smoke,
E’en now the fortress is in flames.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
And Ollantay, is he taken?
Perhaps—I hope his life is saved.

UILLAC UMA.
Ollantay was among the flames,
’Tis said that no one has escaped.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
The Sun, my Father, is my shield,
I am my father’s chosen child.
We must subdue the rebel host,
For that I am appointed here.

(Enter a CHASQUI with a quipu in his hand.)

THE CHASQUI.
This morning at the dawn of day,
Rumi-ñaui despatched this quipu.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(to the Uillac Uma).
See what it says.

UILLAC UMA.
This knot, coloured burnt ahuarancu,
Tells us that Tampu too is burnt;
This triple knot to which is hung
Another which is quintuple,
In all of quintuples are three,
Denotes that Anti-suyu’s thine,
Its ruler prisoner of war.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(to the Chasqui).
And thou. Where wert thou?

THE CHASQUI.
Sole King and Lord! Child of the Sun!
I am the first to bring the news,
That thou mayst trample on the foe,
And in thine anger drink their blood.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Did I not reiterate commands
To spare and not to shed their blood—
Not anger but pity is my rule.

THE CHASQUI.
O Lord, we have not shed their blood;
They were all captured in the night,
Unable to resist our force.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Recount to me in full detail
The circumstances of the war.

THE CHASQUI.
For a signal thy warriors wait.
The nights passed at Tinquiqueru,[69]
Concealed in the cavern below,
Yanahuara[70] men joining us late.

We waited within the large cave,
Thy men always ready to fight,
Behind foliage well out of sight,
Thy warriors patient and brave.

But for three long days and dark nights,
No food for the zealous and bold;
Feeling hungry, thirsty, and cold,
We waited and watched for the lights.[71]

Rumi-ñaui sent orders at length,
When the Raymi[72] they carelessly keep,
And all of them drunk or asleep,
We were then to rush on with our strength.

Word came to surprise our foes,
Rumi-ñaui had opened the gate,
As cautious and silent as fate—
We were masters with none to oppose.

Those rebels fell into the trap,
The arrows came on them like rain,
Most died in their sleep without pain,
Not knowing their fatal mishap.

Ollantay, still trusting, was ta’en,
The same Urco Huaranca befell;
Hanco Huayllu is captive as well,
We thy rebels in fetters detain.

The Antis by thousands are slain,
A fearful example is made,
They are beaten, crushed, and betrayed,
Their women in sorrow and pain.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
As witness of what has occurred,
On Vilcamayu’s storied banks,
No doubt thou hast told me the truth.
It was a well designed attack.

(Enter RUMI-ÑAUI followed by several chiefs.)
