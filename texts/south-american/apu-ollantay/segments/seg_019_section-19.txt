High priest, obey my command.

(The Uillac Uma goes to the wings (R.) and addresses the people
outside.)

UILLAC UMA.
O people, hear what I say:
The Inca, our King and our Lord,
Thus declares his imperial will:
Ollantay shall reign in his place.

PEOPLE outside.
Ollantay Ranti! Ollantay Ranti!

(Shouts and acclamations.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(to Rumi-ñaui and other chiefs.)
You also render him homage.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Prince Ollantay! Incap Ranti!
Thy promotion gives me joy.
All the Antis now released,
Return rejoicing to their homes.

(He and all the Chiefs bow to Ollantay.)

GUARDS WITHOUT.
You cannot pass. Go back! go back!
Voice without. Why, is this a festive day?
Let me pass. I must see the king;
I pray you do not stop me,
Do not drive me from the door;
If you stop me I shall die.
Have a care. You will kill me.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
What noise is that without?

GUARD.
It is a young girl who comes weeping
And insists upon seeing the king.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Let her come in.

(Enter Yma Sumac.)

YMA SUMAC.
Which is the Inca, my lord,
That I may kneel down at his feet?

UILLAC UMA.
Who art thou, charming maid?
Behold the King.

(Yma Sumac throws herself at the King’s feet.)

YMA SUMAC.
O my King! be thou my father,
Snatch from evil thy poor servant.
Extend thy royal hand to me.
O merciful child of the Sun,
My mother is dying at this hour
In a foul and loathsome cave;
She is killed in cruel martyrdom—
Alas! she is bathed in her own blood.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
What inhumanity, poor child!
Ollantay, take this case in hand.

OLLANTAY.
Young maiden, take me quickly there;
We will see who it is that suffers.

YMA SUMAC.
No, sir. Not so. It is the King himself
Should go with me.
Perhaps he may recognise her;

(To Ollantay.)

For you, I know not who you are.
O King, arise, do not delay,
I fear my mother breathes her last,
At least may be in mortal pain;
O Inca! Father! grant my prayer.

UILLAC UMA.
Illustrious King, thou wilt consent;
Let us all seek this luckless one—
Thou canst release from cruel bonds.
Lot us go, O King!

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(rising).
Come all! Come all!
In midst of reconciliations
This young maid assaults my heart.

(Exeunt.)

SCENE 7

The garden in the palace of Virgins of the Sun (same scene as Act III,
Scene 5). Stone door more visible.

(Enter the INCA TUPAC YUPANQUI with YMA SUMAC, OLLANTAY, UILLAC UMA and
RUMI nAUI; URCO HUARANCA, HANCO HUAYLLU and PIQUI CHAQUI in the
background.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
But this is the Aclla Huasi;[81]
My child, art thou not mistaken?
Where is thy imprisoned mother?

YMA SUMAC.
In a dungeon within these bounds
My mother has suffered for years,
Perhaps even now she is dead.

(She points to the stone door.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
What door is this?

(Enter MAMA CCACCA and PITU SALLA. Mama Ccacca kneels and kisses the
Inca’s hand.)
