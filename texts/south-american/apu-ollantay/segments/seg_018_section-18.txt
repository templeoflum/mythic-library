(To Ollantay, kneeling).
Rise from thy knees; come to my side.

(Rises.)

Now thou hast seen death very near,
You that have shown ingratitude,
Learn how mercy flows from my heart;
I will raise thee higher than before.
Thou wert Chief of Anti-suyu,
Now see how far my love will go;
I make thee Chief in permanence.
Receive this plume as general,
This arrow[77] emblem of command.[78]

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(to the Uillac Uma).
Thou mighty Pontiff of the Sun,
Robe him in the regal dress.
Raise up the others from their knees,
And free them from the doom of death.

(Urco Huaranca, Hanco Huayllu, and Piqui Chaqui rise, the latter
looking much relieved. The Uillac Uma places the robe on Ollantay’s
shoulders.)

UILLAC UMA.
Ollantay, learn to recognise
Tupac Yupanqui’s generous mind;
From this day forth be thou his friend,
And bless his magnanimity.
This ring contains my potent charm,
For this I place it on thy hand.

(Gives him a ring, or bracelet.)

This mace receive, ’tis from the king,

(Gives him a mace (champi).)

It is his gracious gift to thee.

OLLANTAY.
With tears I shall nearly consume
That mace thus presented to me;
I am tenfold the great Inca’s slave,
In this world no equal is found,
My heart’s fibres his latchets shall be;
From this moment my body and soul
To his service alone shall belong.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Now, Mountain Chief! come near to me,
Ollantay is given the arrow and plume,
Though to me he gave fury and war.
Notwithstanding all that has passed
He continues the Andean chief,
And will lead his rebels to peace;
Thee also I choose for the plume;
From this day thou art a great chief,
And never forget in thy thoughts,
I saved thee from death and disgrace.

URCO HUARANCA.
Great King and most merciful Lord,
But now, expecting my death,
I am ever thy most faithful slave.

(Uillac Uma gives him the plume and arrow.)

UILLAC UMA.
O Urco, the Inca has made
A great and a powerful chief,
And grants thee with marvellous grace
The arrow and also the plume.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Illustrious King, I venture to ask,
Will Anti-suyu have two chiefs.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
There will not be two, O Rumi-ñaui
The Mountain Chief will rule the Antis;
In Cuzco Ollantay will reign—
As Viceroy deputed by me
His duties will call him to act
As ruler throughout the whole realm.

OLLANTAY.
O King! thou dost raise me too high,
A man without service or claim;
I am thy obedient slave—
Mayst thou live for a thousand years.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
The mascapaycha now bring forth,
And to it the llautu attach.
Uillac Uma, adorn him with these,
And proclaim his state to the world.
Yes, Ollantay shall stand in my place,
Raised up like the star of the morn,
For Colla this month I shall start;
All preparations are made.
In Cuzco Ollantay will stay,
My Ranti[79] and Viceroy and friend.

OLLANTAY.
I would fain, O magnanimous King,
Follow thee in the Chayanta war;
Thou knowest my love for such work.
Peaceful Cuzco is not to my taste,
I prefer to be thy Canari,[80]
To march in the van of thy force,
And not to be left in the rear.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Thou shouldst find the wife of thy choice,
And with her reign happily here
In Cuzco; repose without care;
Rest here while I’m absent in war.

OLLANTAY.
Great King, thy sorrowful slave
Already had chosen a wife.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
How is it I know not of this?
It should be reported to me.
I will load her with suitable gifts;
Why was this concealed from my eyes?

OLLANTAY.
In Cuzco itself disappeared
That sweet and adorable dove;
One day she did rest in my arms,
And the next no more to be seen.
In grief I made search far and near,
Earth seemed to have swallowed her up,
To have buried her far from my sight;
O such, mighty King, is my grief.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Ollantay! afflict not thyself,
For now thou must take up thy place
Without turning thy eyes from thy work.

(To Uillac Uma.)
