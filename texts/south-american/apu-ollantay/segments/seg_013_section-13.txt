YMA SUMAC.
But pleasant is the light of day.

(Exit, R.)

(Enter MAMA CCACCA, L., in grey with black edges and belt.)

MAMA CCACCA.
Pitu Salla, hast thou spoken
All I told thee to that child?

PITU SALLA.
I have said all to her.

MAMA CCACCA.
And she, does she answer freely?

PITU SALLA.
She has wept and asked for pity,
Refusing to comply at all.
She will not take the virgin’s oath.

MAMA CCACCA.
And this in spite of thy advice?

PITU SALLA.
I showed her the dress she will wear,
Telling her misfortune would befall
If she refused to be a chosen one—
That she would ever be an outcast,
And for us a child accursed.

MAMA CCACCA.
What can she imagine,
Wretched child of an unknown father,
A maid without a mother,
Just a fluttering butterfly?
Tell her plainly, very plainly,
That these walls offer her a home,
Suited for outcasts such as she,
And here no light is seen.

(Exit, L.)

PITU SALLA.
Ay, my Sumac! Yma Sumac!
These walls will be cruel indeed,
To hide thy surpassing beauty.

(Glancing to where Mama Ccacca went out.)

What a serpent! What a puma!

ACT III

SCENE 1

The Pampa Moroni, a street in Cuzco. Enter RUMI-ÑAUI (L.)[54] in a long
black cloak with a train, and PIQUI CHAQUI (R.), meeting each other.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Whence, Piqui Chaqui, comest thou?
Dost thou here seek Ollantay’s fate?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Cuzco, great lord, is my birthplace;
I hasten back unto my home.
I care not more to pass my days
In dismal and profound ravines.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Tell me, Ollantay—what does he?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
He is busy now entangling
An already entangled skein.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
What skein?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Should you not give me some present
If you want me to talk to you.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
With a stick will I give thee blows,
With a rope I will hang thee.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
O, do not frighten me!

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Speak then.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Ollantay. Is it Ollantay?
I can remember no more.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Piqui Chaqui! Take care!

PIQUI CHAQUI.
But you will not listen!
I am turning blind,
My ears are getting deaf,
My grandmother is dead,
My mother is left alone.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Where is Ollantay? Tell me.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
I am in want of bread,
And the Paccays[55] are not ripe.
I have a long journey to-day—
The desert is very far off.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
If you continue to vex me
I will take your life.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Ollantay, is it? He is at work.
Ollantay! He is building a wall,
With very small stones indeed;
They are brought by little dwarfs—
So small that to be a man’s size
They have to climb on each other’s backs.
But tell me, O friend of the King,[56]
Why art thou in such long clothes,
Trailing like the wings of a sick bird[57]—
As they are black it is better.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Hast thou not seen already
That Cuzco is plunged in grief?
The great Inca Pachacuti[58] is dead,
All the people are in mourning,
Every soul is shedding tears.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Who, then, succeeds to the place
Which Pachacuti has left vacant?
If Tupac Yupanqui succeeds,
That Prince is the youngest
There are some others older.[59]

RUMI-ÑAUI.
All Cuzco has elected him,
For the late king chose him,
Giving him the royal fringe;
We could elect no other.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
I hasten to bring my bed here.[60]

(Exit running.)

SCENE 2

Great hall of the palace of Tupac Yupanqui. The INCA seated on golden
tiana (C.).

(Enter the HIGH PRIEST or UILLAC UMA, with priests and chosen Virgins
of the Sun. The INCA dressed as his father. Uillac Uma in full dress,
wearing the huampar chucu. Virgins in white with gold belts and
diadems. They range themselves by the throne (L.). Then enter RUMI-ÑAUI
and a crowd of chiefs, all in full dress, ranging themselves by the
throne (R.).)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
This day, O Councillors and Chiefs,
Let all receive my benison;
You Holy Virgins of the Sun[61]
Receive our father’s tenderest care.
The realm, rejoicing, hails me king;
From deep recesses of my heart
I swear to seek the good of all.

UILLAC UMA.
To-day the smoke of many beasts
Ascends on high towards the sun,
The Deity with joy accepts
The sacrifice of prayer and praise.
We found in ashes of the birds
Our only Inca, King, and Lord,
In the great llama sacrifice;
All there beheld an eagle’s form,
We opened it for augury,
But lo! the heart and entrails gone.
The eagle Anti-suyu means—
To thy allegiance they return.

(Bowing to the Inca.)
