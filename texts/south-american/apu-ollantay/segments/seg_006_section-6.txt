CUSI COYLLUR.
O my mother! O most gracious Queen!
How can my tears o’er cease to flow,
How can my bitter sighs surcease,
While the valiant Chief I worship
For many days and sleepless nights,
All heedless of my tender years,
Seems quite to have forgotten me?
He has turned his regard from his wife
And no longer seeks for his love.
O my mother! O most gracious Queen!
O my husband so beloved!
Since the day when I last saw my love
The moon has been hidden from view;
The sun shines no more as of old,
In rising it rolls among mist;
At night the stars are all dim,
All nature seems sad and distressed
The comet with fiery tail,
Announces my sorrow and grief
Surrounded by darkness and tears,
Evil auguries fill me with fears.
O my mother! O most gracious Queen!
O my husband so beloved!

ANAHUARQUI.
Compose thyself and dry thine eyes,
The King, thy father, has arrived.
Thou lovest Ollantay, my child?

(Enter the INCA PACHACUTI. On his head the mascapaycha, with the llautu
or imperial fringe. A tunic of cotton embroidered with gold; on his
breast the golden breastplate representing the sun, surrounded by the
calendar of months. Round his waist the fourfold belt of tocapu. A
crimson mantle of fine vicuna wool, fastened on his shoulders by golden
puma’s heads. Shoes of cloth of gold. He sits down on the golden
tiana.)

INCA PACHACUTI.
Cusi Coyllur! Star of joy,
Most lovely of my progeny!
Thou symbol of parental love—
Thy lips are like the huayruru.[16]
Rest upon thy father’s breast,
Repose, my child, within mine arms.

(Cusi Coyllur comes across. They embrace.)

Unwind thyself, my precious one,
A thread of gold within the woof.
All my happiness rests upon thee,
Thou art my greatest delight.
Thine eyes are lovely and bright,
As the rays of my father the Sun.
When thy lips are moving to speak,
When thine eyelids are raised with a smile,
The wide world is fairly entranced.
Thy breathing embalms the fresh air;
Without thee thy father would pine,
Life to him would be dreary and waste.
He seeks for thy happiness, child,
Thy welfare is ever his care.

(Cusi Coyllur throws herself at his feet.)

CUSI COYLLUR.
O father, thy kindness to me
I feel; and embracing thy knees
All the grief of thy daughter will cease,
At peace when protected by thee.

PACHACUTI.
How is this! my daughter before me
On knees at my feet, and in tears?
I fear some evil is near—
Such emotion must needs be explained.

CUSI COYLLUR.
The star does weep before Inti,
The limpid tears wash grief away.

PACHACUTI.
Rise, my beloved, my star,
Thy place is on thy dear father’s knee.

(Cusi Coyllur rises and sits on a stool by her father. An attendant
approaches.)

ATTENDANT.
O King! thy servants come to please thee.

PACHACUTI.
Let them all enter.

(Boys and girls enter dancing. After the dance they sing a harvest
song.)
