RUMI-ÑAUI.
Great Inca, I kneel at thy feet,
This time You will hear my report,
I beseech thee to deign to restore
The trust that I forfeited once.

(Kneels.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Rise, great Chief, receive my regard,
I accept thy great service with joy;
Thou didst cast o’er the waters thy net,
And hast captured a marvellous fish.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Our enemies perished in crowds,
Their chiefs were captured and bound,
Overwhelmed by my terrible force,
Like a rook detached from the heights.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Was much blood shed in the assault?

RUMI-ÑAUI.
No, Lord, not a drop has been shed,
To thine orders I strictly adhered.
Those Antis were strangled in sleep,
But the fort is entirely razed.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Where are the rebels?

RUMI-ÑAUI.
They are waiting with agonised fear,
For their fate, to perish by cords.
The people are sending up cries,
Demanding their deaths without fail.
Their women are now in their midst,
The children raise hideous cries;
It is well that thine order should pass
To finish their traitorous lives.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
It must be so without any doubt,
That the orphans may not be alone,
Let all perish, not sparing one,
Thus Cuzco recovers her peace,
Let the traitors be brought before me.
In my presence the sentence they’ll hear.

(Exit Rumi-ñaui, and re-enter followed by guards in charge of OLLANTAY,
URCO HUARANCA, and HANCO HAUYLLU, bound and blindfold, followed by
guards with PIQUI CHAQUI bound.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Take the bands off the eyes of those men.
And now, Ollantay, where art thou?
And where art thou, O Mountain Chief?
Soon thou wilt roll down from the heights.

(To the soldiers who bring in Piqui Chaqui.)

Whom have we here?

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Many fleas in the Yuncas abound,
And torment the people full sore,
With boiling water they are killed,
And I, poor flea,[73] must also die.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Tell me, Hanco Huayllu, tell me,
Why art thou Ollantay’s man?
Did not my father honour thee?
Did he not grant thy requests?
Did he ever have a secret from thee?
Speak also, you, the other rebels,
Ollantay and the Mountain Chief.

OLLANTAY.
O father, we have nought to say,
Our crimes are overwhelming us.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
(to the Uillac Uma).
Pronounce their sentence, great High Priest.

UILLAC UMA.
The light that fills me from the Sun
Brings mercy and pardon to my heart.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Now thy sentence, Rumi-ñaui.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
For crimes enormous such as these
Death should ever be the doom
It is the only way, O King!
To warn all others from such guilt.
To stout tocarpus[74] they should be
Secured and bound with toughest rope,
Then should the warriors freely shoot
Their arrows until death is caused.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
Must it be that evermore
The Antis must all perish thus?
Alas! then let the branches burn
What pouring out of blood is here.[75]

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Silence, rash man, nor dare to speak,

(General lamentation outside.)

Having been rolled just like a stone,
My heart has now become a stone.[76]

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Know that tocarpus are prepared.
Remove those traitors from my sight,
Let them all perish, and at once.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Take these three men without delay
To the dreaded execution stakes;
Secure them with unyielding ropes,
And hurl them from the lofty rocks.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Stop! Cast off their bonds.

(The guards unbind them. They all kneel.)
