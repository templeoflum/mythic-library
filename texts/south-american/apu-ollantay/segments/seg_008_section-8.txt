OLLANTAY.
Thou knowest, O most gracious Lord,
That I have served thee from a youth,
Have worked with fortitude and truth,
Thy treasured praise was my reward.[26]

All dangers I have gladly met,
For thee I always watched by night,
For thee was forward in the fight,
My forehead ever bathed in sweat.

For thee I’ve been a savage foe,
Urging my Antis[27] not to spare,
But kill and fill the land with fear,
And make the blood of conquered flow.

My name is as a dreaded rope,[28]
I’ve made the hardy Yuncas[29] yield,
By me the fate of Chancas[30] sealed,
They are thy thralls without a hope.

’Twas I who struck the fatal blow,
When warlike Huancavilca[31] rose,
Disturbing thy august repose,
And laid the mighty traitor low.

Ollantay ever led the van,
Wherever men were doomed to die;
When stubborn foes were forced to fly,
Ollantay ever was the man.

Now every tribe bows down to thee—
Some nations peacefully were led,
Those that resist their blood is shed—
But all, O King, was due to me.

O Sovereign Inca, great and brave,
Rewards I know were also mine,
My gratitude and thanks are thine,
To me the golden axe you gave.

Inca! thou gavest me command
And rule o’er all the Anti race,
To me they ever yield with grace,
And thine, great King, is all their land

My deeds, my merits are thine own
To thee alone my work is due.
For one more favour I would sue,
My faithful service—thy renown.

(Ollantay kneels before the Inca.)

Thy thrall: I bow to thy behest,
Thy fiat now will seal my fate.
O King, my services are great,
I pray thee grant one last request.

I ask for Cusi Coyllur’s hand
If the Ñusta’s[32] love I’ve won.
O King! you’ll have a faithful son,
Fearless, well tried, at thy command.

PACHACUTI.
Ollantay, thou dost now presume.
Thou art a subject, nothing more.
Remember, bold one, who thou art,
And learn to keep thy proper place.

OLLANTAY.
Strike me to the heart.

PACHACUTI.
’Tis for me to see to that,
And not for thee to choose.
Thy presumption is absurd. Be gone!

(Ollantay rises and exit R.)

SCENE 4

A rocky height above Cuzco to the NE. Distant view of the city of Cuzco
and of the Sacsahuaman hill, crowned by the fortress.

(Enter OLLANTAY armed.)

OLLANTAY.
Alas, Ollantay! Ollantay!
Thou master of so many lands,
Insulted by him thou servedst well.
O my thrice-beloved Coyllur,
Thee too I shall lose for ever.
O the void[33] within my heart,
O my princess! O precious dove!
Cuzco! O thou beautiful city!
Henceforth behold thine enemy.
I’ll bare thy breast to stab thy heart,
And throw it as food for condors;
Thy cruel Inca I will slay.
I will call my men in thousands,
The Antis will be assembled,
Collected as with a lasso.
All will be trained, all fully armed,
I will guide them to Sacsahuaman.
They will be as a cloud of curses,
When flames rise to the heavens.
Cuzco shall sleep on a bloody couch,
The King shall perish in its fall;
Then shall my insulter see
How numerous are my followers.
When thou, proud King, art at my feet,
We then shall see if thou wilt say,
‘Thou art too base for Coyllur’s hand.’
Not then will I bow down and ask,
For I, not thou, will be the King—
Yet, until then, let prudence rule.

(Enter PIQUI CHAQUI from back, R.)
