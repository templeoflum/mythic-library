MAMA CCACCA.
Is it a dream or reality,
That I behold my sovereign?
Tupac Yupanqui. Open that door.

(Mama Ccacca opens the door.)

(CUSI COYLLUR discovered chained and fainting, with a puma and a snake,
one on each side of her.)

YMA SUMAC.
O my mother, I feared to find
That you had already passed away;
Pitu Salla! Haste. Bring water.
Perhaps my dove may still revive.

(Exit Pitu Salla.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
What horrid cavern do I see?
Who is this woman? what means it?
What cruel wretch thus tortures her?
What means that chain bound around her?
Mama Ccacca, come near to me
What hast thou to say to this?v Is it the effect of malice
That this poor creature lingers here?

MAMA CCACCA.
It was thy father’s dread command;
A punishment for lawless love.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Begone! begone! harder than rock.[82]
Turn out that puma and the snake,[83]
Break down that door of carved stone.
(To Mama Ccacca.)
Let me not see thy face again.
A woman living as a bat;
This child has brought it all to light.

(Enter Pitu Salla with water. She sprinkles it over Cusi Coyllur, who
revives.)

CUSI COYLLUR.
Where am I? who are these people?
Yma Sumac, my beloved child,
Come to me, my most precious dove.
Who are all these men before me?

(She begins to faint again and is restored by water.)

YMA SUMAC.
Fear not, my mother, ’tis the King;
The King himself comes to see you.
The great Yupanqui is now here.
Speak to him. Awake from thy trance.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
My heart is torn and sorrowful
At sight of so much misery.
Who art thou, my poor sufferer?
Child, tell me now thy mother’s name?

YMA SUMAC.
Father! Inca! Clement Prince!
Have those cruel bonds removed.

UILLAC UMA.
It is for me to remove them,
And to relieve this sore distress.

(Cuts the rope fastening Cusi Coyllur to the wall.)

OLLANTAY.
(to Yma Sumac).
What is thy mother’s name?

YMA SUMAC.
Her name was once Cusi Coyllur,
But it seems a mistake. Her joy
Was gone when she was prisoned here.

OLLANTAY.
O renowned King, great Yupanqui,
In her you see my long lost wife.

(Prostrates himself before the Inca.)

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
It all appears a dream to me.
The ‘Star’! my sister![84] and thy wife.
O sister! what newly found joy.
O Cusi Coyllur, my sister,
Come here to me, and embrace me,
Now thou art delivered from woe.

(Music.)

Thou hast found thy loving brother;
Joy calms the anguish of my heart.

(Embraces Cusi Coyllur.)

CUSI COYLLUR.
Alas! my brother, now you know
The cruel tortures I endured
During those years of agony;
Thy compassion now has saved me.

TUPAC YUPANQUI.
Who art thou, dove, that hast suffered?
For what sin were you prisoned here?
Thou mightest have lost thy reason.
Thy face is worn, thy beauty gone,
Thy looks as one risen from death.

OLLANTAY.
Cusi Coyllur, I had lost thee,
Thou wast quite hidden from my sight,
But thou art brought again to life—
Thy father should have killed us both.
My whole heart is torn with sorrow.
Star of joy, where is now thy joy?
Where now thy beauty as a star?
Art thou under thy father’s curse?

CUSI COYLLUR.
Ollantay, for ten dreary years
That dungeon has kept us apart;
But now, united for new life,
Some happiness may yet be ours.
Yupanqui makes joy succeed grief,
He may well count[85] for many years.

UILLAC UMA.
Bring new robes to dress the princess.

(They put on her royal robes. The High Priest kisses her hand.)
