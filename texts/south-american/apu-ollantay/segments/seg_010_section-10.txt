OLLANTAY.
I doubt not those who seek me—come,
Let us depart and quickly march.

PIQUI CHAQUI.
When flight is the word, I am here.

(Exeunt.)

SCENE 5

The great hall of the palace of Pachacuti. The INCA, as before, seated
on the tiana. Enter to him RUMI-ÑAUI.

PACHACUTI.
I ordered a search to be made,
But Ollantay was not to be found.
My rage I can scarcely control—
Hast thou found this infamous wretch?

RUMI-ÑAUI.
His fear makes him hide from thy wrath.

PACHACUTI.
Take a thousand men fully armed,
And at once commence the pursuit.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Who can tell what direction to take?
Three days have gone by since his flight,
Perchance he’s concealed in some house,
And till now he is there, safely hid.

(Enter a chasqui or messenger with quipus.)

Behold, O King, a messenger
From Urubamba he has come.

CHASQUI.
I was ordered to come to my King,
Swift as the wind, and behold me.

PACHACUTI.
What news bringest thou?

CHASQUI.
This quipu will tell thee, O King.

PACHACUTI.
Examine it, O Rumi-ñaui.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
Behold the llanta, and the knots[36]
Announce the number of his men.

PACHACUTI.
(to Chasqui).
And thou, what hast thou seen?

CHASQUI.
’Tis said that all the Anti host
Received Ollantay with acclaim;
Many have seen, and they recount,
Ollantay wears the royal fringe.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
The quipu record says the same.

PACHACUTI.
Scarcely can I restrain my rage!
Brave chief, commence thy march at once,
Before the traitor gathers strength.
If thy force is not enough,
Add fifty thousand men of mine.
Advance at once with lightning speed,
And halt not till the foe is reached.

RUMI-ÑAUI.
To-morrow sees me on the route,
I go to call the troops at once
The rebels on the Colla road,
I drive them flying down the rocks.
Thine enemy I bring to thee,
Dead or alive, Ollantay falls.
Meanwhile, O Inca, mighty Lord,
Rest and rely upon thy thrall.

(Exeunt.)

END OF ACT I.

ACT II

SCENE 1

Ollantay-tampu. Hall of the fortress-palace. Back scene seven immense
stone, slabs, resting on them a monolith right across. Above masonry.
At sides masonry with recesses; in the R. centre a great doorway. A
golden tiana against the central slab.

(Enter OLLANTAY and URCO HUARANCA, both fully armed.)

URCO HUARANCA.
Ollantay, thou hast been proclaimed
By all the Antis as their Lord.
The women weep, as you will see—
They lose their husbands and their sons,
Ordered to the Chayanta war.
When will there be a final stop
To distant wars? Year after year
They send us all to far-off lands,
Where blood is made to flow like rain.
The King himself is well supplied
With coca and all kinds of food.
What cares he that his people starve?
Crossing the wilds our llamas die,
Our feet are wounded by the thorns,
And if we would not die of thirst
We carry water on our backs.

OLLANTAY.
Gallant friends! Ye hear those words,
Ye listen to the mountain chief.
Filled with compassion for my men,
I thus, with sore and heavy heart,
Have spoken to the cruel king:
‘The Anti-suyu must have rest;
All her best men shan’t die for thee,
By battle, fire, and disease—
They die in numbers terrible.
How many men have ne’er returned,
How many chiefs have met their death
For enterprises far away?’
For this I left the Inca’s court,[37]
Saying that we must rest in peace;
Lot none of us forsake our hearths,
And if the Inca still persists,
Proclaim with him a mortal feud.

(Enter HANCO HUAYLLU, several chiefs, and a great crowd of soldiers and
people.)
