REASONS
FORPREPARING THISAMERICAN EDITION.
Paradise Lost is,bycommon consent, pronounced tobeawork of
transcendent genius and taste. Ittakes rank with theIliad ofHomer,
andwith theJEneld ofVirgil, asanEpic ofincomparable merit. Dry-
denwasbynomeans extravagant inthepraise which hebestowed
upon itinhiswell-known lines :
"Three poets inthree distant ages born,
Greece, Italy, andEngland didadorn :
The first inloftiness ofthought surpassed
;
Thenext inmajesty;inboth the last.
The force ofnature could nofurther go:
Tomake athird, shejoined theother two."
Itspraise isoften onthe lipsofeverymanendowed with themost
moderate literary qualifications :butthework hasbeen readbycom-
paratively fewpersons. How feweven ofeducated men canaffirm
thattheyhave soreadandunderstood it,astoappreciate allitsparts ?
How does thishappen ?Isthepoem considered unworthy oftheir
most careful perusal1
?Isitnotinviting tothe intellect, theimagina-
tion,andthesensibilities? Isitnotacknowledged tobesuperior to
anyother poetic composition, theHebrew writings only excepted, to
whose lofty strains ofinspired song theblind bard ofLondon was s
greatly indebted forhisownsubordinate inspiration ?
Ifinquiry should extensively bemade, itwill beascertained that
Paradise Lost, isbut little read, lessunderstood, and still lessappre-
ciated; though itmaybefound ontheshelves ofalmost every library,
orupon theparlor table ofalmost every dwelling. Every school boy,

andevery school girlhasreadsome beautiful extracts from it,andhas
heard itextolled asanunrivalled production; andthis isabout allthat
isusually learned inregard toit,orappreciated. Thequestion returns,
and itisoneofsome literary interest, how isthistreatment ofthe
Paradise Lost tobeaccounted for?Tothisinquiry thefollowing ob-
servations will, itishoped, beconsidered appropriate andsatisfactory.
Itispre-eminently alearned work;andhasbeen welldenominated
"abook ofuniversal knowledge." Initsnaked form, initsbare text,
itcanbeunderstood andappreciated bynone buthighly educated per-
sons. Theperusal of itcannot fail tobeattended with avivid im-
pression ofitsgreat author's prodigious learning, andoftheimmense
stores which hebrought intouse initspreparation. Asoneofhis
editors, (SirEgerton Brydges,) remarks, "hisgreat poems require
such astretch ofmind inthereader, astobealmost painful. The
mostamazing copiousness oflearning issublimated into allhisconcep-
tionsanddescriptions. Hislearning never oppressed hisimagination;
and hisimagination never obliterated ordimmed hislearning; but
even thesewould nothavedone without theaddition ofagreat heart,
andapureand lofty mind. Thepoem isonewhich could nothave
beenproduced solely bythegenius ofMilton, without theaddition of
anequal extent anddepth oflearning, andanequal labor ofreflection.
Ithasalways agreat compression. Perhaps itsperpetual allusion to
allpast literature and history were sometimes carried alittle toofar
forthepopular reader; andthelatinised style requires tobereadwith
theattention due toanancient classic." Toread it,therefore, intelli-
gently andadvantageously, nosmall acquaintance isneeded with
classical andvarious learning.
While large portions ofthepoem aresufficiently lucid forthecom-
prehension ofordinary readers, there isfrequently introduced anob-
scure paragraph, sentence, clause, orword ;which serves tobreak up
thecontinuity ofthepoem inthereader's mind, toobstruct hispro-
gress, toapprise himofhisown ignorance orobtuseness, andthus to
create nosmall degree ofdissatisfaction. The obscurity arises, in
some cases, from thehighly learned character oftheallusions toan-
cient history andmythology; inother cases, from great inversion of

etyle, from theuseofLatin andGreek forms ofexpression; from re-
culiar modes ofspelling; from references toexploded andunphiloso-
phical notions inastronomy, chemistry, geology, andphilosophy, with
which butfewpersons arefamiliar.
Besides allthis, ithasbeen truly observed bythewriter before
quoted, that"Milton hasalanguage ofhisown ;Imaysayinvented
byhimself. Itissomewhat hard but itisallsincere :itisnotver-
nacular, buthasalatinised cast,which requires alittle time torecon-
cileareader to it. Itisbest fitted toconvey hisown magnificent
ideas;itsvery learnedness impresses uswith respect. Itmoves with
agigantic step :itdoes notflow likeShakspeare's style, nordance
like Spenser's. Now andthen there aretranspositions somewhat
alien tothecharacter oftheEnglish language, which isnotwell cal-
culated fortransposition;but inMilton this isperhaps amerit, be-
cause hislines arepregnant with deepthought andsublime imagery
which requires ustodwell upon them, andcontemplate them overand
over. Heought never toberead rapidly."
Such being some ofthecharacteristics ofParadise Lost, itisnol
difficult toaccount foritsgeneral neglect, andforthescanty satisfac-
tionexperienced bymost persons intheattempt toread it.Much of
it,aswe have remarked, cannot beunderstood; itabounds intoo
many passages thatconvey tonone butthelearned any cleai idea:
thus thecommon reader isrepelled, and thesublimities and beauties
ofthisincomparable poem areknown only asechoes from thepages
ofcriticism, ofcourse inadequately.
Notlong since even awell-educated andpopular preacher was
asked howhemanaged inreading Paradise Lost ?Hishonest and
truthful answer was, thatheskipped overthehard places, andread the
easier; thathedidnotpretend fully tounderstand, ortoappreciate
theentire poem;butadmitted that not -afewpassages were not far
from being adead letter tohim, requiring fortheir just interpretation
more research andstudy than hewaswilling orable tobestow. The
factundoubtedly is,that since apoem isaddressed chiefly totheim-
agination and thesensibilities ;since itisread with aview toplea-
surable excitement, andnottaken upasaproduction tobeseverelj

studied;since ademand formental labor andresearch interferes with
theentertainment anticipated, inmost cases theParadise Lost is,on
thisaccount, laidaside, though possessing thehighest literary merit,
forpoems ofaninferior cast, butofeasier interpretation.
Itispossible alsothat thepious spiritwhich animates theentire
poem, andthetheological descriptions which abound inseveral ofthe
Books, may, tothemass ofreaders, give itarepulsive aspect, and
cause them, though unwisely, toprefer other productions inwhich
these elements arenotfound.
Tothecauses nowenumerated, rather than tothose assigned byDr.
Johnson maybereferred theresult which hethus describes:—"Para-
diseLost isoneofthebooks which thereader admires andlaysdown,
andforgets totakeupagain. None everwished itlonger than itis.
Itsperusal isaduty rather than apleasure. WereadMilton forin-
struction, retire harrassed andoverburdened, andlook elsewhere for
recreation :wedesert ourmaster, andseek forcompanions."
But istherenoremedy for thisneglectful treatment ofthefinestpoeti-
calcomposition inourlanguage ?May notsomething bedone topre-
pareAmerican readers generally toappreciate it,and, intheperusal,
togratify their intellects andregale their fancy, among itsgrandeurs
andbeauties, andalsoamong itslearned allusions, and scientific infor-
mations 1
Theattainment ofthisimportant end isthedesign ofthepresent
edition: itistherefore furnished with alarge body ofnotes; with
notes sufficiently numerous and full, itispresumed, toclearuptheob-
scurities towhich wehave referred;toplace theunlearned reader, so

uponwhich theyshould beadmired. The editions hitherto published
inthiscountry, itisbelieved, areeither destitute ofnotes, orthenotes

required.
About half acen'ury after thepublication oftheParadise Lost,
itsreputation wasmuch advanced byaseries ofpapers which came

outweekly inthecelebrated Spectator, from thegraceful pen of
Addison. "These," asHallam justly remarks, "were perhaps
superior toanycriticisms thathadbeen written inourlanguage, and
wemust always acknowledge their good sense, their judiciousness,
andthevast service they didtoourliterature, insetting theParadise
Lost on itsproper level." Butmodern periodicals, andmodern
essays arefastcrowding outtheonce familiar volumes ofthatexcel-
lent British classic ;andthose oncefamous criticisms arenow seldom
met with, sothatmodern readers, with rareexceptions, derive from
them nobenefit inthereading oftheParadise Lost.
TheEditor hasevinced hisownhigh sense oftheir value, andhas,
moreover, rendered them farmore available totheillustration ofthe
poem, thanthey are,asfound intheSpectator, byselecting such criti-
cisms asappeared tohimtopossess thehighest merit, anddistributing
them intheform ofnotes, totheseveral parts ofthepoem which they
serve toillustrate andadorn. After this labor hadbeen performed,
however, andaprincipal partoftheother notes hadbeen prepared, it
was ascertained withsome surprise, onprocuring aLondon copy of
Bp.Newton's edition ofMilton, now quite scarce,, that thesame course
hadacentury agobeen pursued byhim;though thesame pains had
notbeentaken byNewton todistribute indetail toevery partofthe
poem thecriticisms ofAddison. Besides this, heintroduced them
entire, andthus occupied hispages withmuch matter quite inferior to
thatwhich hasbeen provided, inthis edition, from recent sources.
Thenotes ofthepresent edition will befound toembrace, besides
much other matter, allthat isexcellent andworth preservation in
those ofNewton, Todd, Brydges, andStebbing; comprehending also
some oftherichest treasures oflearned andingenious criticism which
theParadise Lost has called intoexistence, andwhich have hitherto
been scattered through thepages ofmany volumes ofReviews and
miscellaneous literature :andthese have been soarranged astoillus-
trate theseveral parts ofthepoem towhich they retate.
Itwasnotdeemed important tooccupy space inthediscussion of
certain questions, more curious than useful orgenerally interesting,

tonwasgreatly indebted fortheplanandsome prominent features of
theParadise Lost. Yet ithasbeen apleasant, andmore profitable
task, todiscover bypersonal research, andbyaidoftheresearch of
others, those parts ofclassical authors afamiliar acquaintance with
which hasenabled thelearned poetsowonderfully toenrich andadorn
hisbeautiful production. These classic gems ofthought andexpres-
sionhave been introduced inthenotes, only forthegratification of
those persons who areable toappreciate thelanguage oftheRoman
andGrecian poets; andwhomayhave ataste forobserving thecoin-
cidences between theirlanguage andthatofthegreat master ofEng-
lishverse.
Notlong before thecomposition ofParadise Lost, Milton thus
speaks ofthequalifications which heregarded asrequisite andwhich
hehoped toemploy inpreparing it:"Awork nottoberaised from
theheat ofyouth orthevapors ofwine;nortobeobtained ofdame
Memory andhersiren daughters, butby'devout prayer tothatEternal
Spirit,whocanenrich with allutterance andknowledge, andsends out
hisSeraphim with thehallowed fireofhis altar, totouch andpurify
thelipsofwhom hepleases. Tothismust beadded industrious and
select reading, steady observation, insight into allseemly andgenerous
artsand affairs."
•This, Tamconvinced,' says SirE.B.already quoted,'isthetrue
origin ofParadise Lost. Shakspeare's originality might bestillmore
impugned, ifananticipation ofhints and similar stories were tobe
taken asproof ofplagiarism. Inmany ofthedramatist's most beauti-
fulplays thewhole tale isborrowed;butShakspeare andMilton
turnbrass intogold. This sortofpassage hunting hasbeen carried a
great dealtoo far,andhasdisgusted andrepelled thereader offeeling
and taste. Thenovelty isintheraciness, the life,theforce, theju>t
association, theprobability, thetruth;thatwhich isstriking because

poets ;andgives himasolemnity which hasnotbeen surpassed, save
inthebookwhence welled thatinspiration.'
TheEditor isfullyaware oftheboldness oftheattempt tofurnish
afullcommentary onsuch apoem asthis :heisalso painfully sensi-
blethatmuch higher qualifications thanhepossesses could profitably
andhonorably belaidoutintheundertaking. Hehaslongwondered,
andregretted, thatsuch anedition ofParadise Lost, astheAmerican
public needs, hasnotbeen furnished ;and intheabsence ofabetter,
heoffers this edition, asadapted, inhishumble opinion, torender a
most desirable and profitable service tothereading community, while
itmay contribute, ashehopes, tobring thispoem from the state of
unmerited neglect intowhich ithas fallen, andcause ittobemore
generally readand studied, forthecultivation ofaliterary tasteand
fortheexpansion oftheintellectual andmoral powers.
Ours isanageinwhich thebestwritings oftheseventeenth century
have been generally republished, andthushave been putupon anew
career offameand usefulness. Shakspeare hashad, formore than
half acentury, hislearned annotators, without whose aidlarge por-
tions ofhisplays would benearly unintelligible.. Hehasbeen hon-
oredwith public lectures also, toillustrate hisgenius, and tobring
toview hismasterly sketches ofthehuman heart andmanners.
There have recently started uppublic readers also,bywhose popular
exertions hehasbeenbrought intomore general admiration. Itseems
tobefulltime thatahigher appreciation ofthegreat epicofMilton
thanhashitherto prevailed among us,and thatamore extended use-
fulness also, should besecured toit,bythepublication ofcritical and
explanatory notes, such asthecircumstances ofthereading class ob-
viously require.
Ever valuable will itbe,for itsvaried learning, for itsexquisite
beauties ofpoetic diction andmeasure;for itsclassical, scientific and
scriptural allusions; for itsgraphic delineations ofthedomestic state
and itsduties; foritsadaptation, when dulyexplained andunderstood,

tionbeomitted, ofthose excellent counsels, andmaxims ofconduct
which itsofrequently suggests, conveyed inlanguage tooappropriate
andbeautiful tobeeasily erased from thememory, orcarelessly disre-
garded.
Inconclusion, wemay confidently adopt thewords ofBrydges, who
has said, that tostudy Milton's poetry isnotmerely thedelight ofevery
accomplished mind, but itisaduty. Hewho isnotconversant with it,
cannot conceive how farthegenius oftheMuse cango.The bard,
whatever might have been hisinborn genius, could never have at-
tained thisheight ofargument andexecution butbyalifeoflaborious
andholy preparation;aconstant conversance with theideas sug-
gested bythesacred writings; thehabitual resolve tolifthismind
andheart above earthly thoughts ;theincessant exercise ofallthe
strongest faculties oftheintellect; retirement, temperance, courage,
hope, faith. Hehad alltheaidsoflearning; allthe fruit ofallthe
wisdom ofages;alltheeffect ofallthat poetic genius, and allthat
philosophy hadachieved. Hispoetry ispure majesty; thesober
strength, thewisdom from above, that instructs andawes. Itspeaks
asanoracle;notwith amortal voice. And indeed, itwillnothetoo
much tosay, thatofalluninspired writings, Milton's arethemost
worthy ofprofound study byallminds which would know thecrea-
tiveness, thesplendor, thelearning, theeloquence, thewisdom, to
which thehuman intellect canattain.

BOOK I.
THEARGUMENT.
This FirstBook proposes, first, inbrief, thewhole subject, Man's disobe-
dience, andthe lossthereupon ofParadise, wherein hewas placed :then
touches theprime cause ofhis fall,theSerpent, orrather Satan intheser-
pent;who revolting from God, anddrawing tohissidemany legions of
Angels, was,bythecommand ofGod, driven outofHeaven, with allhis
crew, intothegreat deep. Which action passed over, thepoem hastens into
themidst ofthings, presenting Satan with hisAngels now fallen intoHell,
described here, notinthecentre (forHeaven andEarthmaybesupposed as
yetnotmade, certainly notyetaccursed) but inaplace ofutter darkness,
fitliest called Chaos :hereSatan with hisAngels lying ontheburning lake,
thunderstruck andastonished, after acertain space recovers, asfrom confu-
sion, callsuphimwhonext inorder anddignity laybyhim ;they confer of
their miserable fall. Satan awakens allhislegions, who lay tillthen inthe
same manner confounded :they rise ;their numbers, array ofbattle, their
chief leaders named, according tothe idolsknown afterward inCanaan and
thecountries adjoining. Tothese Satan directs hisspeech, comforts them
with hope yetofregaining Heaven, but tellsthem lastly ofanewworld
andnew kind ofcreature tobecreated, according toanancient prophecy
orreport inHeaven ;forthatAngels were long before thisvisible creation,
was theopinion ofmany ancient Fathers. Tofindoutthetruth ofthis
prophecy, andwhat todetermine thereon, herefers toafullcouncil. What
hisassociates thence attempt. Pandemonium, thepalace ofSatan, rises, sud-
denly built outofthedeep :theinfernal peers tnere sitincouncil.


BOOK I.
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
ThisBook onthewhole issoperfect from beginning toend, that itwould
bedifficult tofindasingle superfluous passage. Thematter, the illustra-
tions andtheallusions, arehistorically, naturally, andphilosophically true.
Thelearning isofevery extent anddiversity;recondite, classical, scientific,
antiquarian. Butthemost surprising thing is,themanner inwhich hevivi-
fiesevery topic hetouches :hegives lifeandpicturesqueness tothedriest
catalogue ofburied names, personal orgeographical. Theywho bring no
learning, yet feelthemselves charmed bysounds andepithets which givea
vague pleasure, and stiruptheimagination intoanindistinct emotion.
Poetical imagination isthepower, notonly ofconceiving, butofcreating
embodied illustrations ofabstract truths, which aresublime, orpathetic, or
beautiful;butthose ideas, which Milton hasembodied, noimagination but
hisownwould have dared toattempt ;none elsewould have risen'tothe
height ofthisgreat argument/ Every one elsewould have fallen short oi
it,anddegraded it.
Among themiraculous acquirements ofMilton, was hisdeepandfamilial
intimacy with allclassical and allchivalrous literature;theamalgamation in
hismind ofallthephilosophy and allthesublime andornamental literature of
theancients, and alltheabstruse, thelaborious, theimmature learning of
thosewho againdrew offthemantle oftimefrom theancient treasures of
genius, andmingled withthem theirowncrude conceptions and fantastic
theories. Heextracted from thismine allthatwould aidtheimagination
without shocking thereason. Henever rejected philosophy: butwhere it
was fabulous, only offered itasornament.
InMilton's language though there isinternal force andsplendor, there is
outward plainness. Common readers think that itsounds andlooks like
prose. This isoneofitsattractions ;while allthat isstilted, anddecorated,
andaffected, soon fatigues andsatiates.
Johnson says that "aninconvenience ofMilton's design is,that itrequires
thedescription ofwhat cannot bedescribed.—theagency ofspirits. Hesaw


BOOK I. 13
that immateriality supplied noimages, andthathecould notshow angels
acting butbyinstruments ofaction :hetherefore invested them with form
andmatter. This, being necessary, wastherefore defensible, andheshould
have secured theconsistency ofhissystem bykeeping immateriality outof
sight, andenticing hisreader todrop itfrom histhoughts." Surely thiswas
quite impossible, forthereason which Johnson himself hasgiven. Theim-
agination, byitsnatural tendencies, always embodies spirit. Poetry deals
inpictures, though notexclusively inpictures. E.B.
Upon theinteresting topic here thussummarily though satisfactorily dis-
posed of,Macaulay hasfurnished thefollowing, among other admirable
remarks:
Themost fatal errorwhich apoet canpossibly commit inthemanage-
ment ofhismachinery, isthat ofattempting tophilosophise toomuch.
Milton hasbeen often censured forascribing tospirits many functions of
which spirits must beincapable. Butthese objections, though sanctioned by
eminent names, originate, weventure tosay,inprofound ignorance oftheart
ofpoetry.
What isspirit ?What areourown minds, theportion ofspirit with
whichwearebestacquainted ?Weobserve certain phenomena. Wecan-
notexplain them intomaterial causes. Wetherefore infer thatthere exists
something which isnotmaterial, butofthissomething wehavenoidea.
Wecandefine itonlybynegatives. Wecanreason about itonlybysym-
bols.Weusetheword butwehave noimage ofthething ;andthebusi-
nessofpoetry iswith images, andnotwith words. The poet useswords
indeed, butthey aremerely theinstruments ofhisart,n&t itsobjects. They
arethematerials which heistodispose insuch amanner astopresent a
picture tothemental eye. And, ifthey arenotsodisposed, they areno
more entitled tobecalled poetry than abaleofcanvas andaboxofcolors
aretobecalled apainting.
Logicians may reason about abstractions, butthegreat mass ofmankind
cannever feelaninterest inthem. They must have images. Thestrong
tendency ofthemultitude inallagesandnations toidolatry canbeexplained
onnoother principles. The firstinhabitants ofGreece, there isevery rea-
sontobelieve, worshipped oneinvisible Deity ;butthenecessity ofhaving
something more definite toadore produced, inafewcenturies, theinnumera-
blecrowd ofgods andgoddesses. Inlikemanner theancient Persians
thought itimpious toexhibit theCreator under ahuman form. Yeteven
they transferred tothesuntheworship which, speculatively, they consid-
ereddueonly tothesupreme mind. The history oftheJews istherecord
ofacontinual struggle between pureTheism, supported bythemost terrible
sanctions, andthestrangely fascinating desire ofhaving some visible and
tangible object ofadoration. Perhaps none ofthesecondary causes which
Gibbon hasassigned fortherapidity withwhich Christianity spread over
theworld, while Judaism scarcely ever acquired aproselyte, operated more
powerfully than this feeling. God, theuncreated, theincomprehensible, the


14 PARADISE LOST.
invisible, attracted butfewworshippers. Aphilosopher might admire so
noble aconception ;butthecrowd turned away indisgust fromwords which
presented noimage totheir minds. Itwasbefore Deity embodied inahu-
man form, walking among men, partaking oftheir infirmities, leaning on
their bosoms, weeping over their graves, slumbering inthemanger, bleeding
onthe cross, that theprejudices ofthesynagogue, andthedoubts ofthe
Academy, andthepride ofthePortico, andtheforces ofthelictor, andthe
swords ofthirty legions, werehumbled inthedust.
Soon after Christianity hadachieved itstriumph, theprinciple which had
assisted itbegan tocorrupt it. Itbecame anew Paganism. Patron saints
assumed theoffices ofhousehold gods. St.George took theplace ofMars.
St.Elmo consoled themariner forthe lossofCastor andPollux. The vir-
ginMary andCecilia succeed toVenus andtheMuses. The fascination of
sexand loveliness wasagain joined tothat ofcelestial dignity ;andthe
homage ofchivalry wasblended with that ofreligion. Reformers have
oftenmade astand against these feelings ;butnever withmore thanappa-
rentandpartial success. Themenwhodemolished theimages incathedrals
have notalways been able todemolish thosewhich were enshrined intheir
minds. Itwould notbedifficult toshow that inpolitics thesame ruleholds
good. Doctrines, weare afraid, must generally beembodied before they
canexcite strong public feeling. Themultitude ismore easily interested for
themostunmeaning badge, orthemost insignificant name, than forthemost
important principle.
From these considerations, weinfer thatnopoetwhoshould affect that
metaphysical accuracy forthewant ofwhich Milton hasbeen blamed,
would escape adisgraceful failure, still,however, therewasanother extreme,
which, though onelessdangerous, was also tobeavoided. Theimagina-
tions ofmen areinagreat measure under thecontrol oftheir opinions. The
most exquisite artofapoetical coloring canproduce noillusion when itis
employed torepresent thatwhich isatonce perceived tobeincongruous and
absurd. Milton wrote inanageofphilosophers and theologians. Itwas
necessary therefore forhim toabstain from giving such ashock totheir un-
derstandings, asmight break thecharm which itwas hisobject tothrow
over their imaginations. This istherealexplanation oftheindistinctness
andinconsistency withwhich hehasoften been reproached. Dr.Johnson
acknowledges that itwasabsolutely necessary forhim toclothe hisspirils
with material forms. "But,1
'says he,"heshould have secured theconsis-
tency ofhissystem, bykeeping immateriality outofsight, andseducing the
reader todrop itfrom histhoughts." This iseasily said :butwhat ifhe
could notseduce thereader todrop itfrom histhoughts ?What ifthecon-
trary opinion hadtaken sofullapossession oftheminds ofmen, astoleave
noroom even forthequasi-belief which poetry requires ?Suchwesuspect
tohave been thecase. Itwasimpossible forthepoet toadopt altogether
thematerial ortheimmaterial system. Hetherefore took hisstand onthe
debateable ground. He leftthewhole inambiguity. Hehasdoubtless, by


BOOK I. 15
sodoing, laidhimself open tothecharge ofinconsistency. But,though phi-
losophically inthewrong, wecannot butbelieve thathewaspoetically in
theright. This task,which almost anyother writer would have found im-
practicable, waseasy tohim. The peculiar artwhich hepossessed ofcom-
municating hismeaning circuitously, through along succession ofassociated
ideas, andofintimating more than heexpressed, enabled him todisguise
those incongruities which hecould notavoid.
The spirits ofMilton areunlike those ofalmost allother writers. His
fiends, inparticular, arewonderful creations. They arenotmetaphysical
abstractions. They arenotwicked men. They arenotugly beasts. They
have nohorns, notails. They have justenough incommon withhuman
nature tobeintelligible tohuman beings. Their characters are,liketheir
forms, marked byacertain dimresemblance tothose ofmen, butexagger-
ated togigantic dimensions andveiled inmysterious gloom.

is(asNewton hasobserved) afurther beauty inthevariety ofthenumbers,
which ofthemselves charm every reader without anysublimity ofthought
orpomp ofexpression ;and thisvariety ofthenumbers consists chiefly in
thepause being soartfully varied that itfallsupon adifferent syllable in
almost every line. Thus, inthesuccessive lines itoccurs after thewords
disobedience, tree,world, Eden, us,Muse. InMilton's verse thepause iscon-
tinually varied according tothesense through allthetensyllables ofwhich

spired;and thisreport isconfirmed byapassage inhisSecond Book on
Church Government, already quoted inourpreliminary observations.
24.The hrie;ht oftheargument isprecisely what distinguishes thispoem_
ofMilton from allothers. Inotherworks ofimagination thedifficulty lies
ingiving sufficient elevation tothesubject ;here itliesinraising theimagi-
nation uptothegrandeur ofthesubject, inadequate conception ofitsmighti-
ness,and infinding language ofsuch majesty aswill notdegrade it.A
genius lessgigantic and lessholythan Milton's would haveshrunk from the
attempt. Milton notonly does notlower;butheillumines thebright, and
enlarges thegreat :heexpands hiswings, and"sailswithsupreme domin-
ion"uptotheheavens, parts theclouds, andcommunes with angels andun-
embodied spirits.—E.B.
27.Thepoets attribute akind ofomniscience totheMuse, asitenables
them tospeak ofthings which could nototherwise besupposed tocome to
their knowledge. ThusHomer, Iliad ii.485,andVirgil, JEn. vii.645.
Milton's Muse, being theHoly Spirit, must ofcourse beomniscient.—N.
30.Greatness, isanimportant requisite intheaction orsubject ofan
epicpoem;andMilton here surpasses bothHomer andVirgil. Theanger
ofAchilles embroiled thekings ofGreece, destroyed theheroes ofTroy, and
engaged allthegods infactions. iEneas' settlement inItaly produced the
Caesars andgave birth totheRoman empire. Milton's subject does notde-
termine the fatemerely ofsingle persons, orofanation, butofanentire
species. Theunited powers ofHell arejoined together forthedestruction
ofmankind, which they effected inpartandwould have completed, hadnot
Omnipotence itself interposed. The principal actors areman inhisgreatest
perfection, andwoman inherhighest beauty. Their enemies arethefallen
angels; theMess- iahtheir friend, andtheAlmighty their Protector. In

human mind, governed somuch bysense andimagination, andsolittleby
theabstractions ofphilosophy. Hence theexpression offallen angels,

Upon thecharacter ofSatan asdescribed byMilton, Hazlitt haspenned an

95—116.Amidst those impieties which thisenraged spirit utters invari-
ousparts ofthepoem, theauthor hastaken care tointroduce none that is
notbigwith absurdity, andincapable ofshocking areligious reader ;his
words, asthepoet himself describes them, bearing only a"semblance of
worth, notsubstance." He islikewise with great artdescribed asowning
hisadversary tobeAlmighty. Whatever perverse interpretation heputs
onthejustice, mercy, andother attributes oftheSupreme Being, hefre-
quently confesses hisomnipotence, thatbeing theperfection hewas forced
toallow, andtheonly consideration which could support hispride under the
shame ofhisdefeat.—A.
Upon thisimportant point Dr.Channing hasmade thefollowing observa-
tions :"Some have doubted whether themoral effect ofsuch delineations

andobstinate toacknowledge theMessiah fortheir conqueror;astheir
rebellion was raised onhisaccount, theywould neverown hissuperiority:
theywould rather ascribe their defeat tothewhole hostofheaven than to
him alone. Inbook vi.830thenoise ofhischariot iscompared tothe
sound ofanumerous host; andperhaps their fears ledthem tothink thatthey
were really pursued byanumerous army. Andwhat asublime idea does

andpunished byHeaven. The parts aredistinct, yetgrow outofoneano-
ther inthemost natural method.—A.
THECHARACTERS INPARADISE LOST.
Addison, inhisSpectator, hassome learned andinteresting remarks upon
thistopic, ofwhich thesubstance isnow tobepresented. Homer hasex-
celled alltheheroic poets inthemultitude andvariety ofhischaracters.
Every godthat isadmitted intotheIliad, actsapartwhich would have been
suitable tonoother deity. Hisprinces areasmuch distinguished bytheir
manners asbytheirdominions ;andeven thoseamong them, whose charac-
tersseemwholly made upofcourage, differ fromoneanother astothepar-
ticular kinds ofcourage inwhich they excel.
Homer excels, moreover, inthenovelty ofhischaracters. Some ofthem,
also, possess adignity which adapts them, inapeculiar manner, tothenature
ofanheroic poem.
Ifwelook intothecharacters ofMilton, weshall findthathehasintro-
duced allthevariety hisnarrative was capable ofreceiving. Thewhole
species ofmankind was intwopersons, atthetime towhich thesubject of
hispoem isconfined. Wehave, however, four distinct characters inthese
two persons. Weseemanandwoman inthehighest innocence andper-
fection, and inthemost abject state ofguilt and infirmity. The lasttwo
characters arenow, indeed, verycommon andobvious ;butthe firsttwoare
notonlymore magnificent, butmorenewthananycharacters either inVir-
gilofHomer, or,indeed, inthewhole circle ofnature.
Tosupply thelackofcharacters, Milton hasbrought into hispoem two
actors ofashadowy and fictitious nature, inthepersons ofSinandDeath,
bywhich means hehaswrought intothebody ofhisfable avery beautiful
andwell-invented allegory.—(SeeNote,Book II.649.)
Another principal actor inthispoem, isthegreatAdversary ofmankind.
The partofUlysses, inHomers Odyssey, isverymuch admired byAris-
totle, asperplexing that fable withvery agreeable plots and intricacies, not
onlybythemany adventures inhisvoyage, andthesubtlety ofhisbe-
haviour, butbythevarious concealments anddiscoveries ofhisperson in
several parts ofthatpoem. Butthecrafty being, mentioned above, makes
amuch longer voyage than Ulysses, puts inpractice many more wiles and
stratagems, andhides himself under agreater variety ofshapes andappear-
ances, allofwhich areseverally detected, tothegreat delight andsurprise
jfthereader.
Itmay, likewise, beobserved, withhowmuch artthepoet hasvaried


BOOK I. 57
several characters ofthepersons thatspeak inhisinfernal assembly. Onthe
contrary, hehasrepresented thewhole Godhead exerting itself towards man,
initsfullbenevolence, under thethreefold distinction ofaCreator, Redeemer,
andComforter.
The angels areasmuch diversified inMilton, anddistinguished bytheir
proper parts, asthegods areinHomer orVirgil. The reader will find
nothing ascribed toUriel, Gabriel. Michael, orRaphael, which isnotina
particular manner suitable totheir respective characters.
Theheroes oftheIliadandiEneid, were nearly related tothepeople for
whom Virgil andHomer wrote :their adventures would beread, conse-
quently, with thedeeper interest bytheir respective countrymen. But
Milton's poem hasanadvantage, inthis respect, above both theothers,
since itisimpossible foranyofitsreaders, whatever nation orcountry he
maybelong to,nottoberelated tothepersons who aretheprincipal actors
init ;but,what isstill infinitely more toitsadvantage, theprincipal actors
inthispoem, arenotonlyourprogenitors, butourrepresentatives. Wehave
anactual interest ineverything they do,andnolessthanourutmost happi-
ness isconcerned, and liesatstake inalltheir behaviour.
OBJECTION TOMYTHOLOGICAL ALLUSIONS CONSIDERED.
Thecharge isbrought against Milton ofblending thePagan andChris-
tian forms. The great realities ofangels andarchangels, arecontinually
combined into thesame groups with thefabulous impersonations ofthe
Greek Mythology.
Inother poets, thiscombination might beobjected to,butnotinMilton,
forthefollowing reason :Milton hashimself laidanearly foundation forhis
introduction ofthepagan pantheism intoChristian groups ;thefalse godsof
theheathen were, according toMilton, the fallen angels. They arenot
false, therefore, inthesense ofbeing unreal, baseless, andhaving amerely
fantastical existence, liketheEuropean fairies, butashaving drawn aside
mankind from apureworship. Asruined angels, under other names, they
arenolessrealthan thefaithful andloyal angels oftheChristian Heaven.
And inthatonedifference oftheMiltonic creed, which thepoethasbrought
pointedly andelaborately under hisreaders' notice byhismatchless cata-
logue oftherebellious angels, andoftheirpagan transformations, inthevery
firstbook oftheParadise Lost, islaidbeforehand theamplest foundation for
hissubsequent practice ;and, atthesame time, therefore, theamplest an-
swer tothecharge preferred against himbyDr.Johnson, andbysomany
other critics, whohadnotsufficiently penetrated thelatent theory onwhich
heacted.—

empire ofHeaven with theAlmighty, washurled down toHell. Hisaim
wasnolessthan thethrone oftheuniverse;hismeans, myriads ofangelic
armies bright, who durst defy theOmnipotent inarms. Hisstrength of
mindwas matchless, ashisstrength ofbody :thevastness ofhisdesigns
didnotsurpass thefirm, inflexible determination withwhich hesubmitted
tohisirreversible doom, and final lossofallgood. Hispower ofaction and
ofsuffering was equal. Hewas thegreatest power thatwaseverover-
thrown, with thestrongest will lefttoresist ortoendure. Hewas baffled,
notconfounded. The fierceness oftormenting flames isqualified andmade
innoxious bythegreater fierceness ofhispride :thelossofinfinite happi-
ness tohimself, iscompensated inthought bythepower ofinflicting infinite
misery onothers. Yet,Satan isnottheprinciple ofmalignity, oroftheab-
stract loveofevil,butoftheabstract love ofpower, ofpride, ofself-will
personified, towhich lastprinciple allother goodand evil,andeven hisown,
aresubordinate. Heexpresses thesumandsubstance ofambition inone
line,"Fallen cherub, tobeweak ismiserable, doing orsuffering." He
founds anewempire inHell, andfrom itconquers thisnewworld, whither
hebends hisundaunted flight, forcing hiswaythrough nether andsurround-
ing fires. TheAchilles ofHomer isnotmore distinct ;theTitans were not
more vast ;Prometheus, chained tohisrock,wasnotamore terrific example
ofsuffering andofcrime. Wherever thefigure ofSatan i-sintroduced, whether
hewalks orflies,"rising aloftincumbent onthedusky air," itisillustrated
with themost striking andappropriate images :sothatwesee italways
before us,gigantic, irregular, portentous, uneasy, anddisturbed, butdazzling
initsfaded splendor, theclouded ruins ofagod.Thedeformity ofSatan is
only inthedepravity ofhiswill ;hehasnobodily deformity, toexcite our
loathing ordisgust.
"Notonly thefigure ofSatan, buthisspeeches incouncil, hissoliloquies,
hisaddress toEve, hisshare inthewar inheaven, show thesame decided
superiority ofcharacter."—
Hazijtt.

dashing penofGilfillan.
Hazlitt, intheabove sketch ofMilton's Satan, hadnoauthority forsaying
thathewas notapersonification ofmalice, but,simply, ofpride and self-
will :thiswillappear onreferring toBook I.215-17;Book V.666;Book
VI.151,270;Book IX.126,134.


BOOK II.
THEARGUMENT.
The consultation begun, Satan debates whether another battle betobe
hazarded fortherecovery ofHeaven;some advise it,others dissuade;athird
proposal ispreferred, mentioned before bySatan, tosearch thetruth ofthat
prophecy ortradition inHeaven concerning another world, andanother kind
ofcreature, equal ornotmuch inferior tothemselves, about thistime tobe
created :their doubtwho shallbesentonthis difficult search :Satan, their
chief, undertakes, alone thevoyage, ishonoured andapplauded. The council
thusended, therestbetake them several ways, andtoseveral employments,
astheir inclinations leadthem, toentertain thetime tillSatan return. He
passes onhisjourney toHell-gates, findsthem shut, andwho satthere to
guard them, bywhom atlength they areopened, anddiscover tohimthe
great gulfbetween Hell andHeaven;withwhat difficulty hepasses
through, directed byChaos, thepower ofthat place, tothesight ofthisnew
world which hesought.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Intracing theprogress ofthispoem hydeliberate andminute steps, our
wonder andadmiration increase. The inexhaustible invention continues to
grow upon us;each page, each line, ispregnant with something new, pic-
turesque, andgreat ;thecondensity ofthematter iswithout anyparallel;
theimagination often contained inasingle passage, ismore than equal toall
thatsecondary poets have produced. The fable ofthevoyage through Chaos
isalone asublime poem. Milton's descriptions ofmateriality have always
touches ofthespiritual, thelofty andtheempyreal.
Milton hastoomuch condensation tobefluent :alineortwooften con-
tains aworld ofimages andideas. Heexpatiates over alltime, allspace, all
possibilities ;heunites Earth withHeaven, with Hell,with allintermediate
existences, animate andinanimate ;andhisillustrations aredrawn from all
learning, historical, natural, andspeculative. Inhim,almost always, "more
ismeant thanmeets theeye." Animage, anepithet, conveys arich picture.
What isthesubject ofobservation, maybetoldwithout genius ;butthe
wonder andthegreatness lieininvention, iftheinvention benoble, andac-
cording totheprinciples ofpossibility. Who could have conceived, or,if
conceived, who could have described thevoyage ofSatan through Chaos, but
Milton ?Who could have invented somany distinct andgrand obstacles in
hisway, and allpicturesqu", allpoetical, and allthetopics ofintellectual
meditati :nandreflection, orofspiritual sentiment.
Allthefaculties ofthemind areexercised, stretched andelevated atonce
byevery page ofParadise Lost. That Milton could bring somuch learning,
aswell assomuch imaginative invention, tobearonevery partofhisinfi-
nitely-extended, yetthick-compacted story, istruly miraculous. Were the
learning superficial andloosely applied, thewonder would notbegreat, or
notnearly sogreat; but itisalways profound, solid, conscientious ;andinils
combinations original.—E.B.

620. Milton's Hell isthemost fantastic piece offancy, based onthebroad-
estsuperstructure ofimagination. Itpresents suchascene asthough Switzer-
land were setonfire. Such anuneven, colossal region, fullofbogs, caves, hol-
lowvalleys, broad lakes andtowering Alps, hasMilton's genius cutoutfrom
Chaos, andwrapped indevouring flames, leaving, indeed, hereandthere a
snowy mountain, orafrozen lake, foravariety inthehorror. This wilder-
nessofdeath istheplatform which imagination raises andpeoples with the
fallen thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues, andpowers. Onitthesame
poem, initsplayful fanciful mood, pilesupthepandemonian palace, suggests
thetrickbywhich thegiant fiends reduce their stature, shrinking intoimps,
andseats atthegates ofHell themonstrous forms ofSinandDeath. These
have often been objected to,asiftheywere unsuccessful andabortional ef-
fortsofimagination, whereas they arethecurvettings andmagnificent non-
sense ofthatpower after itsproper work, thecreation ofHell, hasbeen
performed. Thegreat (literary) merit ofMilton's Hell, especially ascom-
pared toDante's, istheunion ofageneral sublime indistinctness, with acleai
statuesque marking outfrom, orpainting on,thegloom, ofindividual forms.
Theonedescribes Hell likeanangel passing through itinhaste, andwith
timeonly tobehold itsleading outlines andfigures ;theother, likeapilgrim,
compelled withslowandpainful steps, tothread allitshigh-ways andby-
ways ofpainandpunishment.—

Dr.Pearce observes thatMilton inhissimilitudes (as isthepractice of

circumstances;which have noother relation tothecomparison than that it

649.Oneither side, fyc. :Theallegory concerning SinandDeath isavery
finished piece, ofitskind, though liable toobjection when considered asa
partofanepicpoem. Thegenealogy oftheseveral persons iscontrived
with great delicacy. Sin isthedaughter ofSatan, andDeath theoffspring
ofSin.The incestuous mixture between SinandDeath, produces those
monsters andHell-hounds which, from time totime, enter intothemother
andtearthebowels ofherwhogavethem birth. These aretheterrors of
anevil conscience, andtheproper fruits ofsin,which naturally arisefrom
theapprehension ofdeath. This isclearly intimated inthespeech ofSin.
Addison further calls ourattention tothejustness ofthought which is
observed inthegeneration ofthese several symbolical persons;thatSinwas
produced upon the first revolt ofSatan—thatDeath appeared soon after he
was cast into Hell, and, thattheterrors ofconscience were conceived atthe
gate ofthisplace oftorment.
"This," says Stebbing, "isoneofthemost sublime passages inthepoem.
\ddison isgenerally ingenious inhiscriticisms, butnotelevated; andwhen
heobjected toMilton's having introduced anallegory, heshows thathewas
incapable ofentering into themagnificent conceptions ofhisauthor. Sin
andDeath arenotallegorical beings inParadise Lost ;butrealandactive
existences. They would have been allegorical, speaking orcontending
among men, butarenotsoinanabode ofspirits, andaddressing thePrince
ofDarkness. SeeJames i.15."

mirably serves toimpress themindwith horror.
883. SeeVirg. Georg. iv.471,"Erebi desedibus imis." Erebus: Ac-
cording toideas oftheHomeric andHesiodic ages, theworld oruniverse
wasahollow globe, divided intotwoequal portions bythe flatdiskoftheearth.
Theexternal shell ofthisglobe iscalled bythepoets brazen and iron, pro-
bably only toexpress itssolidity. The superior hemisphere wasnamed
Heaven: the inferior one,Tartarus. The length ofthediameter ofthe
hollow sphere, isthusgiven byHesiod. Itwould take, hesays, ninedays
forananvil tofallfromHeaven toEarth; andanequal space oftime
would beoccupied byitsfallfromEarth tothebottom ofTartarus. The
luminaries which gave light togodsandmen, shed their radiance through
alltheinterior oftheupper hemisphere;while thatoftheinferior onewas
filledwithgloom anddarkness, and itsstill airwasunmoved byanywind.
Tartarus was regarded, atthis period, astheprison ofthegods, andnotas
theplace oftorment forwicked men, being tothegodswhat Erebus was to

Chaos. Both arehere represented asprogenitors ofNature, bywhich the
arranged creation ismeant. Dropping theallegory, theideaconveyed, is
that night andchaos, ordarkness andaconfused state ofmatter, preceded
theexistence ofnature, oroftheuniverse initsfully arranged andorganized
form. Night andChaos arerepresented asthemonarchs ofaconfused state
oftheelements ofthings, among which hot, cold, moist, ordry, like four
fierce champions, arestriving forthemastery. The falseEpicurean theory
ofcreation ishere alluded to,according towhich theworlds were produced
byafortuitous concourse ofatoms. "Chance governs all."

POETIC DICTION OFMILTON.
Tosome readers itwill notbeunprofitable orunacceptable tooffersome
remarks onthis subject, drawn from Addison's Spectator.
Milton, inconformity with thepractice oftheancient poets, hasinfused
agreatmany Latinisms, aswell asGraecisms, andsometimes Hebraisms,
intothelanguage ofhispoem. Under thisheadmayberanked theplacing
theadjective after thesubstantive, thetransposition ofwords, theturning
theadjective intoasubstantive, with several other foreign modes ofspeech
which thispoethasnaturalized, togive hisverse thegreater sound, andthrow
itoutofprose. Sometimes particular words areextended orcontracted by
theinsertion oromission ofcertain syllables. Milton hasput inpractice
thismethod ofraising hislanguage, asfarasthenature ofourtongue will
permit, aseremite forhermit. Forthesake ofthemeasure ofhis verse,he
haswith great judgment suppressed asyllable inseveral words, andshort-
ened those oftwosyllables intoone, thisexpedient giving agreater variety
tohisnumbers. Itischiefly observable inthenames ofpersons andcoun-
tries, asBeelzebub, Hessebon, andinmany other particulars, wherein hehas
either changed thename, ormade useofthatwhich isnotthemost com-
monly known, thathemight thefurther deviate from thelanguage ofcom-
mon life.
Thesame reason recommended tohim several oldwords, which also
makes hispoem appear themore venerable, andgives itagreater airofan-
tiquity.


BOOK II. 109
There arealsoinMilton several words ofhisown coining, asCerberean
miscreate, hell-doomed, embryon, atomy, andmany others. Thesame
liberty wasmade useofbyHomer.
Milton, bytheabove-mentioned helps, andbythechoice ofthenoblest
words andphrases which' ourtongue would afford him, hascarried ourlan-
guage toagreater height thananyoftheEnglish poets have everdone be-
foreorafter him,andmade thesublimity ofhisstyle equal tothat ofhis
sentiments
;yetinsome places hisstyle isrendered stiffandobscure bythe
methods which headopted forraising hisstyleabove theprosaic.
These forms ofexpression, however, withwhich Milton hassoverymuch
enriched, andinsome places darkened thelanguage ofhispoem, were the
more proper forhim touse,because hispoem iswritten inblank verse.
Rhyme, without anyother assistance, throws thelanguage offfrom prose, and
oftenmakes anindifferent phrase pass unregarded ;butwhere theverse is
notbuiltupon rhymes, therepomp ofsound andenergy ofexpression arein-
dispensably necessary tosupport thestyle andkeep itfrom falling intothe
flatness ofprose.
Upon thesubject ofPoetic Diction, Dugald Stewart offers some excellent
observations, (Works, vol. i.280-3). Hesays :
As itisonegreat object ofthepoet, inhisserious productions, toelevate
theimagination ofhisreaders above thegrossness ofsensible objects, and
thevulgarity ofcommon life, itbecomes peculiarly necessary forhim to
reject theuseofallwords andphrases which aretrivial andhackneyed.
Among thosewhich areequally pureandequally perspicuous, he,ingeneral,
finds itexpedient toadopt thatwhich istheleastcommon. Milton pre-
fersthewords Rhene andDanaw, tothemorecommon words Rhine and
Danube.
"Amultitude, likewhich thepopulous North
Poured never from hisfrozen loins, bipass
Rhene ortheDanaw."—
Book I.353.
Inthefollowing line,
••Things unattempted yetinprose orrhyme,"
howmuch more suitable tothepoetical style does theexpression appear
than iftheauthor had said,
"Things unattempted yetinprose orverse."
Inanother passage, where, forthesake ofvariety, hehasmade useofthe
lastphrase, headdsanepithet toremove italittlefrom thefamiliarity of
ordinary discourse,
" inprose ornumerous verse."
Inconsequence ofthiscircumstance, there arises gradually inevery lan-
guage apoetical diction, which differs widely from thecommon diction of
prose. Itismuch lesssubject tothevicissitudes offashion than thepolite
modes ofexpression infamiliar conversation ;because, when ithasonce
been adopted bythepoet, itisavoided bygood prose writers, asbeing too

elevated forthatspecies ofcomposition. Itmay, therefore, retain itscharm
aslong asthelanguage exists ;nay,thecharmmay increase, asthelanguage
grows older.
Indeed, thecharm ofpoetical diction must increase toacertain degree, as
polite literature advances. For,when once asetofwords hasbeen con-
secrated topoetry, theverysound ofthem, independently oftheideas they
convey, awakens, every timewehear it,theagreeable impressions which
were connected with it,whenwemetwiththem intheperformances ofour
favourite authors. Evenwhen strung together insentences which convey
nomeaning, theyproduce some effect onthemind ofareader ofsensibility;
aneffect, atleast,extremely different from thatofanunmeaning sentence in
prose.
Nor isitmerely byadifference ofwords that thelanguage ofpoetry is
distinguished from thatofprose. When apoetical arrangement ofwords
hasonce been established byauthors ofreputation, themostcommon ex-
pressions, bybeing presented inthisconsecrated order,may serve toexcite
poetical associations.
Ontheother hand, nothing more completely destroys thecharm ofpoetry,
than astring ofwords which thecustom ofordinary discourse hasarranged
insoinvariable anorder, that thewhole phrase maybeanticipated from
hearing itscommencement. Asingle word frequently strikes usasflatand
prosaic, inconsequence ofitsfamiliarity ;buttwosuch words, coupled
together intheorder ofconversation, canscarcely beintroduced intoserious
poetry without approaching theludicrous.
Nopoet inourlanguage hasshown sostrikingly asMilton, thewonder-
fulelevation which stylemay derive fromanarrangement ofwords, which,
while itisperfectly intelligible, departs widely from that towhichweare
ingeneral accustomed. Many ofhismost sublime periods, when theorder
ofthewords isaltered, arereduced nearly tothelevel ofprose.
Tocopy this artifice with success, isamuch more difficult attainment
than iscommonly imagined ;and, ofconsequence, when itisacquired, it
secures anauthor, toagreat degree, from thatcrowd ofimitators who spoil
theeffect ofwhatever isnotbeyond their reach. Tothepoet,who uses
blank: verse, itisanacquisition ofstillmore essential consequence than to
himwhoexpresses himself inrhyme;forthemore thatthestructure ofthe
verse approaches toprose, themore itisnecessary togivenovelty anddignity
tothecomposition. And, accordingly, among ourmagazine poets, ten
thousand catch thestructure ofPope's versification, foronewhoapproaches
tothemanner ofMilton orThomson.
Some ofDr.Channing's observations ontheexpressiveness ofMilton's
numbers, areincluded inthenoteonlines 209-14, Book VI.


BOOK III.
THEARGUMENT.
God, sitting onhisthrone, seesSatan flying towards thisworld, then
newly created; shows him totheSon,who satathisright hand; foretells
thesuccess ofSatan inperverting mankind ;clears hisown justice andwis-
domfrom allimputation, having created Man freeandableenough tohave
withstood histempter
;yetdeclares hispurpose ofgrace towards him, in
regard hefellnotofhisown malice, asdidSatan, butbyhimseduced. The
SonofGodrenders praises tohisFather forthemanifestation ofhisgracious
purpose towards Man ;butGodagain declares, thatgrace cannot beextended
towards Manwithout thesatisfaction ofdivine justice;Man hath offended
theMajesty ofGodbyaspiring toGodhead, and, therefore, with allhispro-
geny, devoted todeath, must die,unless some onecanbefound sufficient to
answer forhisoffence, andundergo hispunishment. TheSonofGod freely
offers himself aransom forMan;theFather accepts him, ordains hisincar-
nation, pronounces hisexaltation above allnames inHeaven andEarth;
commands alltheAngels toadore him ;they obey, andhymning totheir
harps infull choir, celebrate theFather andtheSon. Meanwhile Satan
alights upon thebareconvex ofthisworld's outermost orb,where, wander-
ing,hefirst finds aplace, since called theLimbo ofVanity ;what persons
andthings flyupthither :thence comes tothegateofHeaven, descried
ascending bystairs, andthewaters above thefirmament thatflowabout it;
hispassage thence totheorboftheSun;hefinds there Uriel, theregent ol
that orb,but firstchanges himself intotheshape ofameaner Angel ;and
pretending azealous desire tobehold thenew creation, andManwhom God
hadplaced here, inquires ofhimtheplace ofhishabitation, and isdirected;
alights firstonMount Niphates.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Icannot admit thisBook tobeinferior inpoetical merit, tothosewhich
precede it ;theargumentative parts giveapleasing variety. Theunfavour-
ableopinion hasarisen from anarrow view ofthenature ofPoetry ;from
thetheory ofthosewhothink that itought tobeconfined todescription and
imagery ;onthecontrary, thehighest poetry consists more ofspirit than of
matter. Matter isgood only sofarasitisimbued with spirit, orcauses
spiritual exaltation. Among theinnumerable grand descriptions inMilton,
Idonotbelieve there isonewhich stands unconnected withcomplex intel-
lectual considerations, andofwhich those considerations donotform alead-
ingpartoftheattraction. The learned allusions maybetoodeep forthe
common reader ;andsofar,thepoet isabove thereach ofthemultitude:
buteven thenthey create acertain vague stirinunprepared minds;names
indistinctly heard ;visions dimly seen ;constant recognitions ofScriptural
passages, andsacred names, awfully impressed onthememory from child-
hood, awaken the sensitive understanding with sacred andmysterious
movements.
WedonotreadMilton inthesame lightmood aswereadanyother poet:
his istheimagination ofasublime instructor :wegiveourfaith through
duty aswell aswill. Ifourfancy flagswestrain it,thatwemay appre-
hend :weknow that there issomething which ourconception ought to
reach. There isnotanidleword inanyofthedelineations which thebard
exhibits ;nor isanypicture merely addressed tothesenses. Everything is
invention—arising from novelty orcomplexity ofcombination ;nothing isa
mere reflection from themirror ofthefancy.
Milton early broke loose from thenarrow bounds ofobservation, andex-
plored thetrackless regions ofair,andworlds ofspirits—thegoodandthe
bad. There hispregnant imagination embodied new states ofexistence,
andoutofchaos drew formand life,and allthat isgrand, andbeautiful, and
godlike;andyet,hesomingled them upwith materials from theglobe in
whichweareplaced, that itisanunpardonable error tosaythatParadise
Lost contains little that isapplicable tohuman interests. Thehuman learn-
ing,andhuman wisdom, contained inevery page, areinexhaustible. Onthis
account nootherpoem requires somany explanatory notes, drawn from all
themost extensive stores oferudition.


BOOK III. 113
Ofclassical literature, andoftheItalian poets, Milton wasaperfect mas-
ter.Heoften replenished hisimages andforms ofexpression fromHomer
andVirgil, andyet,never wasaservile borrower. There isanadded plea-
sure towhat initself isbeautiful from thehappiness ofhisadaptations.
Idonotdoubt thatwhat hewrote wasfrom aconjunction ofgenius,
learning, art,andlabour; butthegrand source ofallhispoetical conception
andlanguage, wastheScripture.—E.B.
Horace advises apoet toconsider thoroughly thenature andforce ofhis
genius. Milton seems tohaveknown perfectly wellwherein hisstrength
lay,andhas,therefore, chosen asubject entirely conformable tothose talents
ofwhich hewasmaster. Ashisgenius waswonderfully turned tothesub-
lime, hissubject isthenoblest thatcould have entered intothethoughts of
man. Everything that istruly great andastonishing, hasaplace init.The
whole system ofthe intellectual world—theChaos andtheCreation—
Heaven, Earth, andHell, enter intotheconstitution ofthispoem.
Having, intheFirst andSecond Books, represented theinfernal world
with allitshorrors, thethread ofhisstory naturally leadshim intotheop-
posite regions ofblissandglory.—A.

beyond this, thatcrystalline sphere—thecrystalline Heaven, clear ascrystal—
towhich thePtolemaic astronomers attributed asortoflibration, orshaking
(thetrepidation somuch talked of) ,toaccount for(orcounterpoise) certain
irregularities inthemotion ofthestars ;andbeyond this, thefirstmov'd, the
primum mobile, thesphere which wasboth the firstmoved andthe first

world, withfewexceptions were founded intruth
;yettheywere rejected
byAristotle, andbymost succeeding astronomers, down tothetime of
Copernicus, and intheir place was substituted thedoctrine ofcrystalline
spheres, firsttaught byEudoxus, who lived about 370 b.c.According to
thissystem, theheavenly bodies aresetlikegems inhollow solid orbs,com-
posed ofcrystal sotransparent, thatnoanterior orbobstructs intheleast the
view ofanyoftheorbs that liebehind it.Thesunandtheplanets have
each itsseparate orb ;butthefixed stars are allsetinthesame grand orb;
andbeyond this isanother still, theprimum mobile, which revolves daily
from east towest, andcarries along with italltheother orbs. Above the
whole spreads thegrand empyrean, orthird heavens, theabode ofperpetual
serenity.
Toaccount fortheplanetary motions, itwassupposed thateach ofthe
planetary orbs, aswell asthatofthesun,hasamotion ofitsown, eastward,
while itpartakes ofthecommon diurnal motion ofthestarry sphere. Aris-
totle taught that these motions areeffected byatutelary genius ofeach
planet, residing in it,anddirecting itsmotions, asthemind ofman directs
itsmovements.—

some Christian writers, thepatriarchs, andother pious ancients, who died
before thebirth ofChrist ;hence, theLimbo was called theLirnbus Pa-

MILTON'S SATAN.
Wherever Satan appears, hebecomes thecentre ofthescene. Round
him, asheliesonthe fiery gulf, floating many arood, theflames seem to
doobeisance, even astheir redbillows break upon hissides. When herises
upinto hisproper stature, thesurrounding hosts ofHell cling tohim, like
leaves toatree.When hedisturbs theolddeep ofChaos, itsanarchs,
Orcus, Hades, Demogorgon, ownasuperior. When hestands onNiphates
andbespeaks thesunwhich wasonce hisfootstool, Creation becomes silent,
tolisten tothedread soliloquy. When heenters Eden, ashiver ofhorror
shakes allitsroses, andmakes thewaters ofthefour rivers totremble.
Even inHeaven, theMountain oftheCongregation inthesides ofthenorth,
where hesits,almost mates with theThrone oftheEternal.

Burns, inoneofhisletters, expresses aresolve tobuyapocket-copy of
Milton, andstudy that noble (?)character, Satan.Wecannot join inthis
opinion entirely, although very characteristic oftheauthor ofthe"Address

loftiest genius passing intothehighest art ;iftheywish toseecombined in
onestupendous figure every species ofbeauty, deformity, terror, darkness,

asomething distinct from each, andabsolutely unique;alltheelements of
nature ransacked, and allthecharacters inhistory analysed, inorder todeck

BOOK IV.
THEARGUMENT.
Satan, now inprospect ofEden, andnigh theplacewhere hemustnow
attempt thehold enterprise which heundertook alone against GodandMan,
falls intomany doubts with himself, andmany passions, fear,envy, andde-
spair;butatlength confirms himself inevil,journeys ontoParadise, whose
outward prospect andsituation isdescribed, overleaps thebounds, sitsinthe
shape ofacormorant ontheTree ofLife, ashighest inthegarden, tolook
about him. Thegarden described ;Satan's first sight ofAdam andEve;
hiswonder attheir excellent form andhappy state, butwith resolution to
work their fall ;overhears their discourse, thence gathers thattheTree of
Knowledge wasforbidden them toeatof,under penalty ofdeath;andthereon
intends tofound histemptation, byseducing them totransgress ;then leaves
them awhile, toknow further oftheir statebysome other means. Mean-
while, Uriel, descending onasunbeam, warns Gabriel, whohad incharge
thegateofParadise, thatsome evil spirit hadescaped thedeep, andpassed
atnoonbyhissphere, intheshape ofagoodAngel, down toParadise, dis-
covered afterbyhisfurious gestures intheMount; Gabriel promises
tofindhimeremorning ;nightcoming on,Adam andEvediscourse ofgoing
totheir rest ;theirbower described;their evening worship;Gabriel draw-
ingforth hisbands ofnight-watch towalk theround ofParadise, appoints
two strong Angels toAdam's bower, lesttheevil spirit should bethere
doingsome harm toAdam orEve sleeping ;there they findhim attheear
ofEve,tempting her inadream, andbring him,though unwilling, to
Gabriel ;bywhom questioned, hescornfully answers, prepares resistance
buthindered byasignfromHeaven, fliesoutofParadise.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Ibelieve that thisBook isageneral favourite with readers :there are
parts ofitbeautiful ;but itappears tomefarlessgrand than theBooks
which precede it. Ithas, Ithink, notonly lesssublimity, but lesspoetical
invention. Itrequired lessimagination todescribe thegarden ofEden than
Pandemonium orChaos. Adam andEve are—theone noble, theother
lovely; but stillthey arehuman beings, withhuman passions.—E.B.
Milton, likeDante, hadbeen unfortunate inambition and inlove. He
hadsurvived hishealth and hissight, thecomforts ofhishome, andthe
prosperity ofhisparty. Ofthegreatmenbywhom hehadbeen distin-
guished, some hadbeentakenaway from theevil tocome :some hadtaken
intoforeign climates their unconquerable hatred ofoppression :some were
pining indungeons, andsome hadpoured forth their blood onscaffolds. If
ever despondency andasperity could beexcused inanyman, they might
havebeenexcused inMilton;butthestrength ofhismindovercame every
calamity. Histemper was serious, perhaps stern ;but itwas atemper
which nosufferings could render sullen orfretful. Such asitwas,when,
ontheeveofgreat events, hereturned from histravels, intheprime of
health andmanly beauty, loaded with literary distinctions, andglowing with
.patriotic hopes—such itcontinued tobe—when, after having experienced
every calamity which isincident toournature, old,poor, sightless, and dis-
graced, heretired tohishovel todie !
Hence itwas, thatthough hewrote theParadise Lost atatime oflife
when images ofbeauty andtenderness are,ingeneral, beginning tofade,even
from tnose minds inwhich theyhave notbeen effaced byanxiety anddisap-
pointment, headorned itwith allthat ismost lovely anddelightful inthephysi-
calandinthemoral world. Neither Theocritus norAriosto hadafiner, ora
more healthful sense ofthepleasantness ofexternal objects, orloved better
toluxuriate amidst sunbeams and flowers, thesongs ofnightingales, the
juice ofsummer fruits, andthecoolness ofshady fountains. Hispoetry
reminds usofthemiracles ofAlpine scenery: nooks and dells, beautiful
asfairy land, areembosomed initsmost rugged and gigantic elevations.
The roses andmyrtles bloom unchilled ontheverge oftheavalanche.—

twokinds ;either such asareemployed indescription, orsuch asaresug-
gested bythewarmth ofpassion ;for iftheimagination hasatendency to
magnify itsobjects beyond their natural proportion, passion possesses this
tendency inavastly stronger degree ;and, therefore, notonlyexcuses the
most daring figures, butvery often renders them natural and just. Allpas-
sions, without exception, love, terror, amazement, indignation, anger, and
even grief,throw themind into confusion, aggravate their objects, and,of
course, prompt ahyperbolical style. Hence, thefollowing sentiments of
Satan inMilton, asstrongly asthey aredescribed, contain nothing butwhat
isnatural andproper, exhibiting thepicture ofamind agitated with rage
anddespair.—
Blair.

upforour firstparents, itisanatural inquiry, How didheproceed informing
it?Whatwasthemental process bywhich heelaborated sobeautiful ade-
scription, forhewrites onlyfrom imagination ?
The steps bywhich hemust have proceeded increating hisimaginary
garden, arethus felicitously described byDugald Stewart (Works, vol. i.360).
When hefirstproposed tohimself thatsubject ofdescription, itisreasonable
tosuppose thatavariety ofthemost striking scenes, which hehad seen,
crowded into hismind. The association ofideas suggested them, andthe
power ofconception placed each ofthem before himwith allitsbeauties
andimperfections. Inevery natural scene, ifwedestine itforanypar-
ticular purpose, there aredefects andredundancies which artmaysome-
times, butcannot always, correct. Butthepower ofimagination isun-
limited. Shecancreate andannihilate;anddispose, atpleasure, herwoods,
herrocks, andherrivers. Milton, accordingly, would notcopy hisEden
from anyonescene, butwould select fromeach thefeatures which were
mosteminently beautiful. Thepower ofabstraction enabled him tomake
theseparation, and taste directed him inthe selection. Thus hewas fur-
nished with hismaterials;byaskilful combination ofwhich, hehascreated
alandscape, more perfect, probably, inallitsparts, thanwasever realized
innature, and, certainly, very different from anything which England ex-
hibited attheperiod when hewrote. Itisacurious remark ofMr.Wal-
pole, thatMilton's Eden isfreefrom thedefects oftheoldEnglish garden,
and isimagined onthesame principles which itwasreserved forthepre-
sentagetocarry intoexistence.

stroyed thewatchful serpent thatkept the tree,andgathered theapples.
Herewehave astrange mixture oftheinternal andexternal incidents of
Paradise, theideas oftheprimeval people viewing fromwithout theEden
fromwhich theywere excluded, andcoveting itsgolden fruits, mixed upwith
thosewhich belong properly tothe fall,theserpent, andthetreeoflife,or
ofthetree ofknowledge—forinthese oldtraditions thetrees arenotsowell
distinguished asintheMosaic account. Inthislegend ofHercules theidea
seems tobe,thattheaccess tothetreeoflife isimpossible, tilltheSonof
Godopens theway, andovercomes theserpent, bywhom thataccess ispre-
vented.
Itdeserves remark also, that inmost ofthose accounts ofthedragon or
serpent, whom theheathen regarded asthesource ofevil,andwhich could
bevanquished onlybytheSonofGod inhuman form, heiscalled Typhon
orPython, awordwhich signifies "toover-persuade, todeceive." Now this
veryname Pitho, orPython, designates thegreat deceiver ofmankind.

thatwhich isoften found inLatin andGreek authors, when they usethe

997. Scales :Thebreaking off c-fthecombat between Gabriel andSatan
bythehanging outofthegolden scales inheaven, isarefinement uponHo-
mer's thought, who tellsusthatbefore thebattle between Hector andAchilles,
Jupiter weighed theevent ofitinapairofscales. Book xxii.
"Jove liftsthegolden balances, thatshow
The fates ofmortal menandthings below;
Here eachcontending hero's lothetries,
Andweighs, withequal hand, their destinies.
Low sinks thescale surcharged with Hector's fate
;
Heavy withdeath itsinks, andhellreceives theweight."
Virgil, before thelastdecisive combat, describes Jupiter inthesameman-
ner,asweighing thefates ofTurnus andiEneas. Milton, though hefetched
thisbeautiful circumstance from theIliadandiEneid, doesnotonly insert it
asapoetical embellishment, liketheauthors above-mentioned, butmakes an
artful useofitfortheproper carrying onofhisstory, andforthebreaking
oft'ofthecombat between thetwowarriors, whowereupon thepoint ofen-
gaging. Tothiswemay further add,thatMilton isthemore justified in
thispassage, aswefindthesame noble allegory inholy writ,where awicked
prince, somefewhours before hewasassaulted and slain, issaid tohavebeen
"weighed inthescales andtohavebeen found wanting."—A.

forthatwhich determined thesequel, consequences, orevent, either ofparting

course demonstrated that inarms hewould prove inferior toGabrielv1012 :
theother weight, being theheavier, showed that itwas hiswisest course to
hasten away from themeditated combat. Newton hascalled attention tothe

DIFFICULTIES INEXECUTING THEPORTRAIT OFOUR
FIRST PARENTS.
The difficulty which metMilton inhisportrait ofour firstparents was,
obviously, tomake them perfect, without being unnatural ;tomake them
sinless, andyetdistinguish them from angels;toshowthemhuman, yetun-
fallen ;tomake, inshort, anew thing ontheearth ;aman andwoman
beautiful beyond desire, simple beyond disguise, graceful without conscious-
ness,naked without shame, innocent butnotinsipid, lofty butnotproud
;
uniting inthemselves thequalities ofchildhood, manhood, andwomanhood
asif,inoneseason, spring, summer, andautumn could beimagined. This
wasthetaskMilton hadtoaccomplish;and, athisbidding, there arose the

again, isMilton's life-long dream ofwhatwoman was,andyetmaybe—a
dream fromwhich heagain andagain awoke, weeping, because thebright
vision hadpassed away, andacold reality alone remained. Youseeinher

Adam isthegoodliest ofhissons, because heis(poetically) formed bycom-

BOOK V.
THEARGUMENT.
Morning approached, Eve relates toAdam hertroublesome dream;ne
likes itnot,yetcomforts her ;theycome forth totheir daylabours;their
morning hymn atthedoor oftheirbower. God, torender man inexcusable,
sends Raphael toadmonish himofhisobedience, ofhisfree estate, ofhis
enemy near athand,whoheis,andwhy hisenemy, andwhatever elsemay
availAdam toknow. Raphael comes down toParadise, hisappearance de-
scribed, hiscoming discerned byAdam afar off.sitting atthedoor ofhis
bower ;hegoes outtomeet him, brings him tohislodge, entertains him
with thechoicest fruits ofParadise gottogether byEve;their discourse at
table ;Raphael performs hismessage, mindsAdam ofhisstate andofhis
enemy;relates, atAdam's request, who thatenemy is,andhow hecame
tobeso,beginning from hisfirstrevolt inHeaven, andtheoccasion thereof;
howhedrew hislegions afterhimtotheparts ofthenorth, andthere incited
them torebel with him,persuading allbutonly Abdiel, aSeraph ;who in
argument dissuades andopposes him,then forsakes him.
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
ThisBook consists ofelements ofthesame character andofsimilar combi-
nation astheFourth. Eve's dream, andthemanner ofrelating itareinavery
highdegree poetical. Here theinvention isperfect inimagery, sentiment,
andlanguage. Theapproach oftheangel Raphael, asviewed atadistance
byAdam, isdesigned with allthose brilliant circumstances, andthose unde-
iinable touches, which give theforce ofembodied reality toavision.
The hints ofalarge partoftheincidents aretaken from theScriptures;
buttheinvention isnotonthataccount the less.Tobring thedim,gene-
ralidea intobroad light inallitslineaments, isthedifficulty, andrequires
thepower.
Theconversation between Raphael andAdam isadmirably contrived on
both sides. Those argumentative portions ofthepoem arealmost always
grand. Now andthen, indeed, thebard indulges inthedisplay oftoomuch
abstruse learning, ormetaphysical subtleties. Inrelating thecause ofSatan's
rebellion, Raphael sustains allthealmost unutterable sublimity ofhissub-
ject.'Thehero isdrawn wicked anddaring beyond prior conception, but
mighty andawful asheiswicked. Language, toexpress these high thoughts,
would have sunk before anyother genius butMilton's ;andashehad to
convey themovements ofheavenly spirits byearthly comparisons, the diffi-
culty increased every step—E.B.

thought higher, thattheywere likeorient pearls."
Thegoddess Aurora, saysDr.Anthon, sometimes represented inasaffron-
coloured robe,with awand ortorch inherhand, coming outofthegolden
palace, andascending agolden chariot. Homer describes heraswearing a
flowing veil,which shethrows back todenote dispersion ofthenight, and
asopening with herrosy fingers thegates ofday. Others represent herasa
nymph crowned with flowers, with astarabove herhead, standing ina
chariot drawn bywinged horses, while inonehand sheholds atorch, and
with theother scatters roses, asillustrative oftheflowers which spring from
thedew,which thepoets describe asdiffused from theeyes ofthegoddess
inliquid pearls.

Though Milton seems tohave derived hintsandexpressions from agreat

anew character towhat hetook. The similar passages sonumerously
pointed outbycommentators, arenotsimilar inforce and poetical spirit.

which arespoken onalike occasion, and filled with thesame pleasing

reprobated, were unnatural inabeing continually contemplating theuni-
verse with anundimmed eye ;but itisvery inconsistent tosuppose he
would personify theprinciple ofthings, andseparate itsoperation from the
immediate action ofthedivine hand. Nature wasanoble andsplendid

254-56. Tillatthegate, &>-c. :This passage contrasts beautifully insound
with thatwhich describes thegates ofHell, Book II.879-83. SeeHo-
mer's Iliad, v.749.
Raphael's departure from before thethrone andhisflight through thechoirs
ofangels, isfinely imagined. AsMilton everywhere fills hispoem with
circumstances thataremarvellous andastonishing, hedescribes thegate of
Heaven asframed aftersuch amanner that itopened ofitself upon theap-
proach oftheangelwhowas topassthrough it.
Thepoet inthese linesseems tohave regarded two orthree passages in
the18th Iliad, asthat inparticular where, speaking ofVulcan, Homer says
thathehadmade twenty tripods running ongolden wheels, which, upon oc-
casion, might goofthemselves totheassembly ofthegods, and,when there
wasnomore useforthem, return again after thesame manner.
But, asthemiraculous workmanship ofMilton's gates isnotsoextraordi-
nary asthisofthetripods, Iampersuaded hewould nothavementioned iti
hadhenotbeen supported initbyapassage ofScripture which speaks of
wheels inHeaven thathad lifeinthem, andmoved ofthemselves, orstood
still, inconformity with theCherubim whom theyaccompanied.
There isnoquestion thatMilton had thiscircumstance inhisthoughts,
because, inthefollowing Book hedescribes thechariot oftheMessiah with
living wheels, according totheplan inEzekiel's vision.—A.

267-85. Hespeeds, fyc.:Raphael's descent totheearth, with thefigure of
hisperson, isrepresented invery lively colours, andconformably totheno-
tions given ofangels inScripture. Milton, afterhaving sethim forth inall
hisheavenly plumage, andrepresented him ashaving alighted upon theearth,
thepoet concludes hisdescription with acircumstance which isaltogether
new, andimagined with thegreatest strength offancy. Raphael's reception
bytheguardian angels, hisdistant appearance toAdam, have allthegraces
thatpoetry iscapable ofexpressing.

about sixhundred years, itconstructs afuneral pileoflightwood andodorous
gums, upon which, kindled bytherays ofatropical sun, itisconsumed.
Another phxnix starts upfrom theashes, bearsaway therelics ofthepile
toThebes inEgypt, andplaces them intheTemple oftheSun,other birds
accompanying him inthisoperation, andgazing upon him.
According toanother account, shelighted thecombustible pilewith the

make itnone oftheleast agreeable parts inthisdivine work.—A.

MILTON'S PORTRAIT OFTHEANGELS ANDDEVILS.
Milton's management ofhisangels anddevils proves, asmuch asanything
inthepoem, theversatility ofhisgenius, thedelicacy ofhisdiscrimination
ofcharacter, thatShakspearian quality inhimwhich hasbeen somuch over-
looked. Tobreak upthegeneral angel ordevilelement intosomany finely-
individualized forms;to fitthelanguage tothecharacter ofeach; todothis
inspite ofthedignified andsomewhat unwieldy character ofhisstyle;to
avoid insipidity ofexcellence inhisseraphs, andinspidity ofhorror inhis
fiends;tokeepthem erect andundwindled, whether inthepresence ofSatan
ontheoneside, orofMessiah ontheother,—wasaproblem requiring skill
aswell asdaring, dramatic aswell asepicpowers. Nomere mannerist could
have succeeded in it.Yet,what vivid portraits hashedrawn ofMichael,
Raphael (how like, intheir difference from each other, aswell asintheir
names, tothetwogreat Italian painters !) ,Abdiel, Uriel, Beelzebub, Moloch,
Belial,Mammon—allperfectly distinct ;allspeaking aleviathan language,
which, inall,however, ismodified bythecharacter ofeach, andinnone sinks
intomannerism. IfMilton hadnotbeen thegreatest ofepic poets, hemight
have been thesecond ofdramatists. Macaulay hasadmirably shown how,
orrather thatShakspeare haspreserved thedistinction between similar char-
acters, such asHotspur andFalconbridge;andconceded even t©,Madame
D'Arblay aportion ofthesame power, indepicting several individuals, all
young, allclever, allclergymen, allinlove,andyet allunlike each other.
ButMilton hasperformed amuch more difficult achievement. Hehas re*

presented five devils, allfallen, alleloquent, allintorment, hate,and hell,
andyetallsodistinct thatyoucould with difficulty interchange alineofthe
utterances ofeach. None butSatan, theincarnation ofegotism, could have
said—
'•What matter where, ifIbestillthesame?'•
None butMoloch—therashanddesperate—could thusabruptly havebroken
silence—
;iMysentence isforopenwar."
None butBelial—thesubtile, far-revolving fiend—could havespoken of
"Those thoughts thatwander through eternity."
None butMammon—thedown-looking demon—would ever, alluding tothe
subterranean riches ofHell,haveasked thequestion—
'•What canHeaven showmore ?"
Or,whobutBeelzebub, theMetternich ofPandemonium, would havecom-
menced hisoration with such grave, terrific irony as—

BOOK VI.
THEARGUMENT.
Raphael continues torelatehowMichael andGabriel were sent forth to
battle against Satan and hisAngels. The first fight described ;Satan and
hisPowers retire under night ;hecallsacouncil, invents devilish engines,
which, inthesecond day's fight, putMichael andhisangels tosome disorder
;
butthey atlength, pulling upmountains, overwhelmed both theforce and
machines ofSatan. Yetthetumult notsoending, Godonthethirddaysends
Messiah hisSon, forwhom hehadreserved theglory ofthatvictory ;He,
inthepower ofhisFather, coming totheplace, andcausing hislegions to
stand stilloneither side,with hischariot andthunder driving intothemidst
ofhisenemies, pursues them, unable toresist, towards thewall ofHeaven;
which opening, they leapdown with horror andconfusion intotheplace of
punishment prepared forthem inthedeep;Messiah returns withtriumph to
hisFather.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
The battle oftherebellious angels isthegrand feature ofthisBook, and is
generally regarded asoneofthemost admirable parts ofthepoem. Iwill
frankly confess that Icannot entirely subscribe tothis opinion. Inthe first
place, theintroduction oftheinvention ofartillery intothecombat isobjec-
tionable :inthewarofspirits itisdegrading, andalmost ludicrous. Inthe
whole mode ofcarrying onthismighty effort against Heaven, there istoo
much ofearth andmaterialism. Itwillbeanswered, that thiswasofne-
cessity;forhowwasawarofspirits tobeexpressed ?Perhaps suchadif-
ficulty wasinsurmountable;butthen thesubject should havebeen covered
with amantle ;atleast theelements might havebeenmade tocontend—a
universal tempest offire,wind, andwater. Here everything isconducted
almost intheordinary manner, andwith thetechnical skill ofhuman war-
fare,except thatthedegree offorce ismore gigantic.
Itwillbepleaded thatMilton hadtheauthority ofthelanguage ofHoly
Writ forsuch descriptions, andthathegenerally speaks intheverywords of
theBible. Itistrue thatheadapts these words with astonishing skill and
genius ;buthecontrives togointo details which break upthespell oftheir
mysteries. Thephraseology ofthese sacred writings referred toisastonish-
ingly sublime, picturesque, andpoetical :ifMilton could have stopped ex-
actlywhere thatstopped, hewould havedone better. This isaboldcensure,
but itissincere. Ithink thatthepoetwas ledinto thisbyhisrivalry of
Homer andVirgil, andtheother ancient classics. Hehadagreat advantage
overthem inhissubject, andheshould nothave fallen from it.There isno
poetry inHomer orVirgil likethepoetry oftheBible.
Thecondensed collocation ofMilton's language ispeculiar tohimself. Its
breaks—itsbursts—thestrong—therough andtheflowing—theconcise and
thegigantic—aremingled with asurprising skill, andeloquence, andmagic.
Itiseasy tofind single gems inother authors; thegalaxy isthewonder.
Milton's splendour, when itbegan torise, didnotstop till itblazed.
Even supposing hisBook ofBattles tobeliable tothecensure Ihave haz-
arded, stillthemanner inwhich itaugments itsforce asitgoes onward, is
miraculous. The character ofSatan, combining theheight ofwickedness
with grandeur ofpower andwill, issupported inastate ofprogressive eleva-
tion;while theDeity, Father andSon, still retains hissupremacy, and to
whatever sublimity therebel angel islifted, soars inunapproached dominion
above him. Allthis isdisplayed with marvellous splendour ofgenius inthe
close oftheSixth Book. The effects ofSatan's defeat areconceived andde-
scribed with asuperhuman strength ofimagination. —E.B.

Prometheus Unbound. These goddesses areoften depicted asforming thetrain
ofVenus.—

5.Mount ofGod, fyc. :Inhisdescription ofHeaven, Milton findsample
field fortheserious aswell asthesportive exercise ofhisunbounded imagi-
nation. Hegives ustheconception ofaregion immeasurably large. Many
earths aremassed together toform onecontinent surrounding thethrone ol
God ;acontinent, notofcloud oraery light, butoffixed, solid land,with
steadfast, towering mountains, andsoftslumbrous vales ;towhich Pollok, in
hiscopy ofit,hasadded, finely, wastes andwildernesses —retreats even there

theregion, thethrone ofJehovah, nowbathed inlight, andnowshaded by

34.Universal reproach :Another example ofthisinharmonious measure is
found in874 :itisnotcommon, but,asJortin observes, Milton often inserts

duce inmusic.

byMilton theleader oftheheavenly armies, andthename inHebrew sig-

conduct inthepoem, thatthecommission heregiven isnotexecuted. They

Thosewholook intoHomer aresurprised tofind hisbattles still rising one

ton's fight ofangels iswrought upwith thesame beauty. Itisushered in

flight ofinnumerable burning darts andarrows, which aredischarged from
each host. Thesecond onset isstillmore terrible, asitisfilledwith those
artificial thunders which seem tomake thevictory doubtful, andproduce a
kind ofconsternation even inthegood angels. This isfollowed bythelear-
i«gupofmountains andpromontories;till,inthelastplace, Messiah comes
lor:a inthefulness ofmajesty and terror. Thepomp ofhisappearance,

imagination. —A.

"Milton's numbers have theprime charm otexpressiveness. They vary
with, andanswer to,thedepth, ortenderness, orsublimity ofhisconcep-
tions, andhold intimate alliance with the soul. LikeMichael Angelo, in
whose hands themarble was said tobeflexible, hebends ourlanguage—
which foreigners reproach with hardness—intowhatever form thesubject
demands. Allthetreasures ofsweet andsolemn sound areathiscom-
mand. Thispower over language isnottobeascribed toMilton's musical
ear. Itbelongs tothesoul. Itisagiftorexercise ofgenius which has
power toimpress itself onwhatever ittouches ;and finds, orframes, in
sounds, motions, andmaterial forms, correspondences andharmonies with its
own fervid thoughts andfeelings.

thing isalive andanimated. Thevery chariot- wheels aremadandraging.

212-14. Bentley objects tosome ofthelanguage here used, andwould
correct itthus :withdismal hiss thefiery darts, &c. Milton's language is,
indeed, quite inaccurate;but, asDr.Pearce observes, there isapeculiar
forcesometimes inascribing that toacircumstance ofthething, which more
properly belongs tothething itself: tothehiss,which belongs tothedarts
Or,thephrase hissofdarts, isequivalent tohissing darts.

BOOK VII.
THEARGUMENT.
Raphael, attherequest ofAdam, relates howandwherefore thisworld
was firstcreated ;thatGod, after theexpelling ofSatan and hisAngels out
ofHeaven, declared hispleasure tocreate another world andother creatures
todwell therein ;sends hisSonwith glory andattendance ofAngels toper-
form thework ofcreation insixdays ;theAngels celebrate withhymns the
performance thereof, andhisreascension intoHeaven.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
The Seventh Book isnothing butdelight ;allbeauty, andhope, and
smiles. Ithas little oftheawful sublimity ofthepreceding books, and it
hasmuch lessofthatgrand invention which sometimes astonishes with a
painful emotion, butwhich isthe firstpower ofthepoet :atthesame time
there ispoetical invention infilling upthedetails.
Inevery description Milton hasseized themost picturesque feature, and
found themost expressive and poetical words for it.Onthemirror ofhis
mind allcreation wasdelineated intheclearest andmost brilliant forms and
colours ;andhehasreflected them with suchharmony andenchantment of
language., ashasnever been equalled.
Here istobefound everything which indescriptive poetry hasthegreatest
spell;allmajesty orgrace offorms, animate orinanimate ;allvariety of
mountains, and valleys, and forests, and plains, and seas, and lakes, and
rivers; thevicissitudes ofsunsandofdarkness ;theflame andthesnow;
themurmur ofthebreeze ;theroarofthetempest.
One great business ofpoetry is,toteachmen tosee,and feel,andthink
upon thebeauties ofthecreation, and tohave gratitude anddevotion to
theirMaker:thiscanbestbeeffected byapoet's eyeandapoet's tongue.
Poets canpresent things inlights which canwarm thecoldest heart :he
whocanhimself create, canbestrepresent what isalready created.—E.B.
The author, inthisBook, appears inakind ofcomposed and sedate
majesty;andthough thesentiments donotproduce such intense emotions
asthose inthepreceding Book, theyabound with asmagnificent ideas. The
Sixth Book, likeatroubled ocean, represents greatness inconfusion ;the
Seventh affects theimagination like theocean inacalm, and fillsthemind
ofthereader, without producing initanything liketumult oragitatiou.
InthisBookwhich gives usanaccount ofthesixdays' works, thepoet
received butveryfew assistances from heathen writers, who arestrangers
tothewonders ofcreation. But asthere aremany glorious strokes of
poetry upon this subject inHoly Writ, theauthor hasnumberless allusions
toitthrough thewhole course ofthisBook.—A.


BOOK VII.
Descend from Heav'n, Urania, bythatname
Ifrightly thou artcall'd, whose voice divine
Following, above th'Olympian hillIsoar,
Above theflight ofPegasean wing.
1.Urania: Anallusion tooneoftheheathen Muses, thegoddess ofas-
tronomy. Butunder thisname (5)thepoet addresses another personage—
aheavenly personage (Urania means heavenly) ,andnotafiction(39).He
represents herasexisting prior tothecreation oftheworld(8),asthe
sister ofthatEternal Wisdom, whom Solomon celebrates, intheeighth
chapter ofhisBook ofProverbs, asassisting attheformation oftheheaven-
lybodies andoftheearth. ToherSolomon gives thename ofPrudence.
Prov. viii. 12.The poet(40)denotes heragoddess, merely inaccommo-
dation toclassical poetic usage. She isintroduced, though animaginary
being, togive variety tothenarrative. Wisdom, intheeighth chapter ofthe
Book ofProverbs, isaboldandhappy personification ofthedivine attribute
ofthatname.
3.Olympian hill :Amountain inThessaly, which theheathen poet^
fabled tobetheresidence ofthe gods, because itstop,rising above tie
clouds, wasalways serene.
3-4.The plain import ofthese lines is,thatheentertained hisreaders
with subjects ofthought farmore elevated than thosewhich were exhibited
byheathen poets intheir loftiest excursions.
4.Pegasean wing :Pegasus, inheathen mythology, was awinged horse,
which threw Bellerophon, itsowner, when attempting toflytoHeaven.
Pegasus afterwards ascended toaplaceamong thestars. The fallofBeller-
ophon isalluded tobyMilton, below (17-19).

inoneofhisaddresses, thus beautifully illustrates thispassage :InParadise
Lostwefeelasifwewere admitted totheouter court ofthe Infinite. In
that all-glorious temple ofgenius inspired bytruth,wecatch the fulldiapa-
sonoftheheavenly organ. With itsfirst choral swell, thesoul islifted
from theearth. IntheDivina Commedia (ofDante) ,theman, theFloren-
tine, theexiled Ghibbeline, stands out,from first tolast,breathing defiance
andrevenge. Milton, insome ofhisprose works, betrays thepartisan also;
butinhispoetry, weseehim inthewhite robes oftheminstrel, with up-
turned, though sightless eyes, rapt inmeditation atthefeetoftheheavenly
muse. Dante, inhisdark vision, descends tothedepths oftheworld of
perdition, and,homeless fugitive thathe is,drags hisproud andprosperous
enemies down with him,andburies them, doubly destroyed, intheflaming
sepulchres ofthelowest Hell (DelP Inferno, Cantos ix..x.) Milton, onthe
other hand, seems almost tohavepurged offthedross ofhumanity. Blind,
poor, friendless, insolitude andsorrow, with quite asmuch reason ashis
Italian rival torepine athisfortune, andwar against mankind, howcalm
andunimpassioned ishe,inallthat concerns hisown personality !He
deemed toohighly ofhisdivine gifttomake ittheinstrument ofimmor-
talizing hishatreds. One cry,alone, ofsorrow athisblindness Book III.
40-50), one pathetic lamentation onthe -'evil days'' onwhich hehad

human wrath inallhispictures ofwoe. Hating nothing butevil spirits, in
thechild-like simplicity ofhisheart, hispure hands undefiled with the
pitch ofthepolitical intrigues inwhich hehad lived, hebreathes forth his
inexpressibly majestic strains, thepoetry notsomuch ofearth asofheaven.
25.Evildays: Reference isheremade totheprofligate anddangerous
times ofCharles theSecond, uponwhose restoration tothethrone, Milton,
having been theLatin Secretary ofCromwell, andanopponent oftheroyal
party, apprehended, inthe first place, thelossofhislifefrom theroyal ven-
geance, andwhen freefrom thatdanger upon receiving pardon, hisappre-
hensions next arose from exposure tothemalice andresentment ofprivate
individuals. Richardson says thatMilton, atthistime oflife,wasalways
infear,much alone, andslept ill ;that,when restless, being blind, hewould
ring fortheperson who wrote forhim (.hisdaughter generally,towrite
what hehadcomposed, which would sometimes flowwith great ease.
Macaulay, hasthuscharacterised the"evildays" ofwhich Milton speaks :
Thencame those days,never toberecalled without ablush—thedaysofser-
vitude without loyalty, andsensuality without love—of,dwarfish talents and
gigantic vices—thegolden ageofthecoward, thebigot, andtheslave. The
king cringed tohisrival, thathemight trample onhispeople : :as:k intoa

gation ofhispolitical enemies, referred toinaformer note, that hisblind-
nesswas toberegarded asapunishment ofhis"execrable" writings on
state affairs. Inoneofhisreplies, hemakes known tousincidentally his
ardour inthecause ofhuman freedom, andopposition totyranny, asthepromi-
nent cause ofhistotal blindness—theoccasion, atleast, ofrapidly hastening
thatsadevent. Hesays :"Asforwhat Iwrote atanytime (since royalists
think Isuffer onthataccount, andtriumph overme) ,IcallGod towitness
that Ididnotwrite anything butwhat Ithen thought, andam still per-
suaded tobe,right and true,andacceptable toGod ;norledbyanysortof

declaring theexistence ofthewatery chaos previously totheerainwhich

thewillofGod,have everbeen inherent init,stillexisted. The sun,then,
acting byitsusual lawsupon sovast abody ofwaters, gradually, inthe
continuous lapse ofages,drew upaprodigious mass ofdense anddark
vapours, which, heldsuspended intheatmosphere, threw apallofblackest
night around theglobe. Allthings beneath itbecame invisible, andnoray
oflight could pierce thethick canopy ofdarkness. Layer upon layer, in
almost infinite succession ofclosely-packed anddarkling clouds, filled the
atmosphere, andabsorbed every particle oflight long before itcould reach

toncopies) isstrictly anthropopathic, orinharmony with thefeelings, views,
andpopular modes ofexpression which prevail inanearly state ofsociety,
andwhich arealways bestadapted foruniversal use. Hence thecollo-
quial ordramatic style oftheaccount. Forexample :AndGodsaid—not

beafirmament—lettheearth bring forth ;bywhichwearetounderstand that
these effects were produced justasifsuch afiathadbeen, ineach instance,
vocally uttered, andsuchaformula actually employed. The bare volitions
oftheInfinite Mind aredeeds.
Inorder tointerpret theMosaic cosmogony aright, another facttobeborne
inmind is,thatevery visible object isspoken of.notaccording toitsscien-
tificcharacter, but optically, oraccording toitsappearance
;just as,with all
ourknowledge ofthesolar system, wespeak, even inscientific works, of
thesunasrising and setting. Forexample—Hadthere been anunscientific
human spectator ofthecreative process, theatmosphere would have ap-
peared tohiseye asitdoes still toevery untutored eye—afirmandsolid
expanse, sustaining thewaters above. Thesunandthemoon would have
appeared tobe"two great lights" ofnearly equal magnitude, compared with
which alltheastral systems deserved only thatwhich isallotted tothem—apassing word. Thedescriber issupposed tooccupy anearthly position,
himself thecentre oftheuniverse. Theearth issaid tohave brought forth
grass, andthewaters tohave produced living creatures, though weareto
believe thatnocreative power was delegated totheelements toproduce
them, but,thattheyweremade infullperfection bythesimple volition of
Omnipotence;butthen, toahuman looker-on, they would soappear to

Firmament: Kitto properly observes that theprimary meaning ofthe
Hebrew word (Gen. i.7)thus translated is,expansion, outstretching, attenua-
tion, elasticity, which arethevery properties ofouratmosphere ;butthe
word usedbytheGreek translators, together with thelong-prevalent notion,
thatthematerial heavens formed asolid hemispheric arch, shining andpel-
lucid, inwhich thestarswere set,ledsubsequent translators torender the
wordbyfirmament. Thisword is,however, admissable, ifbysolidity is
meant nomore than that thefluidatmosphere hasdensity orconsistence
sufficient tosustain thewaters above it.
Itis,perhaps, notcorrect tosay,assome do,thatouratmosphere now
firstexisted. The dense vapour which issupposed tohave previously in-
vested theearth, implies theexistence ofanatmosphere. But itnow first,
atthistime, existed asaseparating expanse;andnow divested ofthegross
murky particles withwhich itwascharged, itbecame transparent and re-
spirable—themedium oflightandoflifetothesurface oftheearth.
Theexpanse isdescribed asseparating thewaters from thewaters. The
historian speaks asthings would have appeared toaspectator atthetime of
thecreation. Aportion oftheheavy, watery vapour hadflown intothe
upper regions, and rested there indense clouds, which stillobscured the
sun ;while below, thewhole earth was stillcovered with water, forthe

BOOK VIII.
THEARGUMENT.
Adam inquires concerning celestial motions ;isdoubtfully answered, and
exhorted tosearch rather things moreworthy ofknowledge;Adam assents;
and, still desirous toretain Raphael, relates tohimwhat heremembered
since hisown creation; hisplacing inParadise; histalkwithGodconcern-
ingsolitude and fitsociety;his firstmeeting andnuptials withEve ;his
discourse with theAngel thereupon ;who, after admonitions repeated, de-
parts.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Nopraise canbedeemed toohigh forthisEighth Book ofParadise Lost.
Wearefilledwith themost delightful astonishment whenweread Milton's
picture ofthecreation ofAdam andEve ;thebeauty, theglow, theenthu-
siasm, therapture running through allthesenses and alltheveins;theun-
alloyed grandeur oftheman, thecelestial grace ofthewoman;themajesty
ofhismovements, thedelicacy ofhers; theinconceivable happiness of
thoughts andwords withwhich their admiration ofeach other isexpressed;
thebreaks, theturns oflanguage, theinspired brilliance andflow ofthe
strains, yettheinimitable chastity andtransparence ofthewhole style, fill
asensitive reader with anunfeigned wonder andexaltation, which itwould
bevain toattempt adequately torecord.
Theargumentative parts ofthepoem areasprofound andexcellent as
those intheformer Books. They arenot,asDryden hashinted, flatand
unprofitable, butthereverse. They areexalted, closely argued, nakedly but
vigorously expressed, sagacious, moral, instructive, comprehensive, deep in
theknowledge oflife,consolatory, andfortifying. Whoever supposes them
unpoetical, hasanarrow, mean conception ofpoetry :they arenever outof
place, butresult from theleading characters ofthepoem ;they arequite
asessential toit,even asitsgrand, orbeautiful, andbreathing imagery.—
E.B.
OfAdam andEve ithasbeen said, thattheordinary reader canfeel little
interest inthem, because theyhave none ofthepassions, pursuits, oreven
relations ofhuman life,except thatofhusband andwife, the least interest-
ingofallothers, ifnottotheparties concerned, atleast toallby-standers.
Itistrue there islittle action inthis partofMilton's poem ;butthere is
much repose andmore enjoyment. There arenone oftheevery-day occur-
rences, contentions, disputes, wars, feuds, jealousies, trades, professions, and
common handicrafts oflife ;':nokind oftraffic ;letters arenotknown;no
useofservice, ofriches, poverty, contract, &c. ;notreason, felony, sword,

pike, knife, gun, norneed ofanyengine." Somuch thebetter :thank
Heaven, allthese were yettocome. But still inthem ourdoom was
sealed.
Intheir first false stepwetrace allourfuture woe,with lossofEden,
buttherewasashort andprecious interval between, likethe firstblush of
morning before theday isovercast with tempest, thedawn oftheworld,
thebirth ofnature, with itsfirstdews andfreshness onitscheek breathing
odours. Theirs was the firstdelicious taste oflife,andonthem depended
allthatwas tocome ofit.Inthemhung trembling allourhopes andfears.
They were asyetalone intheworld, intheeyeofnature, wondering at
theirnew being, fullofenjoyment, andenraptured with oneanother, with
thevoice oftheirMaker walking inthegarden, andministering angels at-
tendant ontheir steps, winged messengers fromHeaven, likerosy clouds, de-
scending intheir sight. Was there nothing inthis scene, which Godand
Nature alone witnessed, tointerest amodern critic ?What needwasthere
ofaction, where theheartwas fullofblissandinnocence without it?
They stood awhile perfect, butthey afterwards fell,andwere driven out
ofParadise, tasting the first fruits ofbitterness asthey haddone ofbliss.
Buttheir tearswere "such asangels weep." Thepathos isofthatmildcon-
templative kindwhich arises from regret forthe lossofunspeakable hap-
piness, andresignation toinevitable fate.They hadreceived their unlook-
ed-for happiness asafree giftfrom their Creator's hands, andtheysubmitted
toitsloss,notwithout sorrow, butwithout impious andstubborn repining.—
Hazlitt.

5.What thanks, &fc.:Theaccounts which Raphael gives ofthebattle of
theangels andthecreation oftheworld, have inthem those qualifications
which the critics judge requisite toanepisode :they arenearly related to
theprincipal action, andhave ajustconnection with thefable.
ThisBook opens with abeautiful description oftheimpression which this
discourse ofthearchangel made onour firstparents Adam afterwards, by
avery natural curiosity, inquires concerning themotions ofthose celestial
bodies which make themost glorious appearance among thesixdays' work.

posing very judiciously thedifficulties thatoccur inthe first,andwhich was
thesystem most obvious tohim. The reply oftheangel touches onthe
expedients which thePtolemaics invented tosolve those difficulties andto

Cycle isanimaginary orborcircle intheheavens. Epicycle isacircle
upon acircle, andwillbemore fully explained below.
These terms areemployed intheexplanation ofthePtolemaic system, the
author ofwhich nourished atAlexandria inthesecond century after Christ,
andnearly three centuries after Hipparchus, whowasthefounder ofGrecian
astronomy, andwhose principal discoveries have been transmitted inthe
works ofPtolemy, which wastheuniversal text-book onastronomy, until
thetime ofCopernicus, inthefifteenth century.
According tothePtolemaic system, which was digested byhim chiefly
from materials furnished byearlier writers anddiscoverers, theearth occupies
thecentre oftheuniverse, and allthecelestial bodies revolve around itfrom
east towest. Itexplains theapparent motions ofthesun,moon, andplanets,
according toahypothesis invented byagreat geometer, Apollonius ofPerga,
some centuries before, andwhich consists insupposing each ofthese bodies
tobecarried byauniform motion round thecircumference ofacircle called
theepicycle, thecentre ofwhich iscarried uniformly forward inthecircum-
ference ofanother circle called thedeferent. This second circlemay bethe
epicycle ofathird, andsoonaslong asinequalities remain tobeexplained;
theearth occupying aposition near, butnot at,thecentre ofthelast circle.
This hypothesis isutterly demolished byafewaccurate observations ofthe
present day; butinthetime ofPtolemy itserved toexplain allthedevia-
tionsfrom circular motion thenknown, particularly thephenomena ofthe
stations, andretrogradations oftheplanets (from west toeast" ;and itwas
even ofservice toastronomy, byoffering ameans ofreducing theapparent
irregularities oftheplanetary motions toarithmetical calculation.
Itisthesystem towhich almost alltheological writers, even ofthe
seventeenth century, uniformly refer,when theyhave occasion tospeak of
thecelestial phenomena. SeeBrande's Diet.

elegant andbeautiful species, didnotafford anycreature suited tobehis

equal being. Nothing wasbetter calculated torealize thisimpression, than
tobring thevarious animal existences under thenotice ofAdam, and, atthe
same time, toendow himwith theperception oftheir several qualities and
natures, asisimplied inhisbeing able togivethem distinctive andappro-
priate names. Itisvery possible that, being asyetignorant oftheDivine
intention, Adam considered thathewasexpected tofindoutforhimself a
meetcompanion among these creatures. SoMilton understood it(369-377),
inaveryremarkable passage inwhich heseems toascribe thepower of
reasoning tobrutes.—K.
349.Each birdandbeast behold, fyc.:Theimpression which theinterdiction
ofthetreeoflife leftonthemind ofour firstparent, isdescribed with great
strength andjudgment ;astheimage oftheseveral beasts and birds pass-
inghere inreview before him, isvery beautiful andlively.—A.
350.Ofcourse, modern rationalizing philosophy hasfound something in
thisremarkable statement onwhich tohang itscavils. Ithasbeen ascer-
tained, itisurged, thatanimals areexclusively adapted totheregions which
they inhabit, andthat itwould becontrary totheir nature, andzoologically
impossible, forthem toleave theirown climates, and toassemble inone
place. Itiscertain that, ifthisdidtake place, asassumed, itwas asuper-
natural impulse which urged them totravel toonepoint ;andweshould
think thatnobeliever intheexistence andpower ofGodcandoubt the
possibility ofsuchanimpulse being given, whether hebelieves that itwas
given ornot. Butagain,how didweknow thatvarious climates didexist
before thedeluge ?There isgood reason tothink, thatbefore then thetem-
perature oftheearth wasthrough allparts more equal than ithasbeen
since; andhence theanimals would have nodifficulty inpassing from one
partoftheworld toanyother.
But, again, was there anynecessity forthismigration oftheanimals of
different climates toEden ?Onwhat ground isitassumed thus quietly that
animals were created intheir different climates ?Why might they notbe

notbeing specified. Farther, itwasunnecessary thattheattention ofAdam
should beengaged byanimals hewas notlikely toseeagain, andwhich
hadnosuitableness tothepurpose immediately inview.
Asthese various creatures, doubtless, presented themselves tothenotice
ofAdam inpairs, hemust themore deeply havebeen convinced ofhisown
isolated condition. Allthese creatures hadsuitable companions, andhehad
none :each ofthem was already provided with amate, andcould beno
"help meet" forhim.—K.
353-54. Indued mysudden apprehension :Inpreviously describing the
naming ofthecattle, Milton takes thesameview aswedo,thattheknow-
ledge involved inthat actwasconveyed byinstant andsupernatural enlight-
enment.—K.
Theaccount givenbyMoses isembraced inGen. ii.19,20
;yetfrom this
short record what asplendid episode hasMilton here produced, andwhat an
admirable dialogue from thelatter partonly ofthataccount!
Much hasbeen inquired regarding thecondition ofAdam inrespect of
knowledge. Allaccounts necessarily assign tohimtheutmost physical per-
fection ofman's nature ;butintheview ofsome hewasmerely anaked
savage, whohad allthings toacquire byexperience. This isnotfromany
intended disrespect tothefather ofmankind ;butbecause itwasanold
theory thatknowledge, intelligence, andthe artsofcivilization, were pro-
gressively acquired inthe firstages;and itwastherefore necessary thatthe
progenitor oftherace should beinastate ofignorance, asitcould notbut
besupposed thathewould impart suchknowledge ashepossessed tohis
descendants. Ontheother hand, there arethosewhourge thatAdam, in-
structed ofGod,must have been possessed ofallknowledge ofwhich the
mind ofman iscapable, andhave beendeeply skilled inallthesciences and
artsofcivilization.
That bothextremes arewrongwehavehave nodoubt. Adam was, at

life.Hewastaught ofGod,andnotlefttogather byslow experience all

Inother creatures therewasnonatural connection between thepairs inthe
very actofcreation. The sexes were, inthem, created independently of
each other. Butthefactofwoman's derivation fromman—apartofhim-
solf,separated tobeinanother form re-united tohim—wascalculated toin-
dicate and tooriginate anespecial tenderness intheir nuptial state, and its
indissoluble character, Eph. v.28-31. Surely toteach such lessons asthese,
wasasufficient reason forthemode ofwoman's creation. Shewas tobe
created insomemode orother, andhowever created, inthatwould have

THEARGUMENT.
Satan, having compassed theearth with meditated guile, returns asamist
bynight intoParadise, enters intotheSerpent sleeping. Adam andEve in
themorning goforth totheir labours, which Eveproposes todivide inseveral
places, each labouring apart ;Adam consents not,alleging thedanger, lest
thatenemy, ofwhom theywere forewarned, should attempt her,found alone
;
Eve, loth tobethought notcircumspect orfirmenough, urges hergoing
apart, therather desirous tomake trialofherstrength;Adam atlastyields;
theSerpent findsheralone ;hissubtle approach, firstgazing, then speaking,
withmuch flattery extolling Eveabove allother creatures. Eve,wondering
tohear theSerpent speak, askshowheattained tohuman speech andsuch
Tinderstanding not tillnow;theSerpent answers, thatbylasting ofacertain
tree inthegarden heattained both tospeech andreason, tillthen void of
both ;Eve requires him tobring hertothat tree,andfinds ittobethetree
ofknowledge, forbidden ;theSerpent, nowgrown bolder, withmany wiles
andarguments, induces heratlength toeat ;she,pleased with thetaste, de-
liberates awhile whether toimpart thereof toAdatn ornot ;atlastbrings
him ofthe fruit, relates what persuaded hertoeatthereof; Adam, atfirst
amazed, butperceiving her lost, resolves, through vehemence oflove, toper-
ishwith her,and,extenuating thetrespass, eatsalsoofthefruit :theeffects
thereof inthem both ;theyseek tocover their nakedness;then falltova-
riance andaccusation ofoneanother.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
TheNinth Book israised upon thatbrief account inScripture, wherein we
aretoldthattheserpent wasmore subtile thananybeast ofthe field, that
hetempted thewoman toeattheforbidden fruit, thatshewasovercome by
thistemptation, andthatAdam followed herexample. From thesefewpar-
ticulars Milton hasformed oneofthemost entertaining narratives that in-
vention everproduced. Hehasdisposed ofthese several circumstances among
somany beautiful andnatural fictions ofhisown, that hiswhole story looks
only likeacomment upon sacred writ, orrather seems tobeafullandcom-
plete relation ofwhat theother isonlyanepitome. The disposition and
continuance ofthestory Iregard astheprincipal beauty oftheNinth Book,
which hasmore story initand isfuller ofincidents, thananyother inthe
whole poem.—A.
TheNinth Book isthatonwhich thewhole fateand fallofman turns
;
andsofaristhemost important. Itiscalled themost tender. Ifthesub-
mission tosensual human passions betenderness, itisso;taking theresist-
ance tothose passions tobeloftiness. Theserpent himself appears tohave
beenenamoured ofEve's beauty andloveliness ofmien, andforamoment to
have repented oftheevilhewasplotting tobring upon her.
Allthatweknow from theMosaic history is,that theserpent tempted
Eve,andEvetempted Adam toeatoftheforbidden fruit; butwedonot
know bywhat wiles this sinwasbrought about.Wemaysuppose thatby
theserpent, theoperation oftheevilpassions ofcontradiction, disobedience
rebellion, andscepticism ismeant: justaswemaysuppose thatEvepersisted
inroaming alone inspite ofAdam's dissuasions, merely because herpride
wasthwarted byherhusband's fear that "someharm should befal her" in
hisabsence.—E.B.
Thesentiments advanced bySirE.Brydges inthelastparagraph arenot
inaccordance with Scriptural truth orsound philosophy, aswillbemade
evident from thefollowing statements andreasonings ofDr.Kitto :
Inthesadhistory ofthe fall,there isscarcely anyoneincident which more
exercises ourthoughts than thenature ofthecreature bywhose banefu1
Eaia^ostions that ruinwasbrought topass. The sacred record, inthethird


362 PARADISE LOST.
chapter ofGenesis, says plainly enough that itwas "aserpent," described
asbeingllmore subtile thananybeast ofthefield ;"andthefinalcurse also
indicates theserpentine condition—"Upon thybelly shalt thou go,anddust
shalt thou eatallthedays ofthy life."
Hence, some have regarded thetempter asaserpent, andnothing more.
This opinion hasmany more advocates than thereader might suppose;or
rather, ithashadthem, forthere arefewwhonowentertain thisopinion. To
thequestion, How could amere serpent tempt Eve, itisanswered, that itlay
intherepeated usebytheserpent oftheforbidden fruit inherpresence,
without anyoftheapparent effects uponhimwhich shehadbeen taught to
dread. The influence ofthisexample, andthethoughts thathence arose in
hermind, arethen represented, agreeably tothegenius oforiental and figu-
rative language, intheform ofaconversation. The great objection tothis
is,that thealleged figurative style here, isadverse tothe literal toneand
character ofthewhole narrative; and,what isfarmore conclusive, that
another agent isclearly pointed outintheNew Testament, andmay,bythe
light thus afforded, bediscovered even intheoriginal account.
That agent istheDevil, orSatan, andthegeneral opinion is,thatheem-
ployed oractuated theserpent ashisinstrument. Thus thelatter appears to
reason andtospeak. Thewoman converses with him,andshe isled,bythe
artful representations which theDevil enables him tomake, totransgress the
divine law.Nomere animal could have taken thepart thisserpent did.
But itmaybedoubted whether Eveknew this. Itispossible thatthein-
tuitive perception ofthequalities ofanimals whichAdam possessed, wasnot
shared byEve, butwas tobeimparted toherbyhim ;and itishighly pro-
bable thathehadnotyetcommunicated toher alltheknowledge ofthiskind
which hadbeen acquired byhim before shehadexistence. Itisfarfrom
improbable that theknowledge ofthis factwasamong theconsiderations
which induced Satan toapply himself through theserpent tothewoman ra-
therthan totheman. She,being continually making newdiscoveries inthe
animal creation, would belittle surprised inatlength finding onecreature
thatcould speak, andeven reason. Or,supposing shedidknow thatanimals
could notdoeither, ithasseemed touspossible thattheserpent byeating
the fruit inhersight,mayhave ledhertoconclude that hissuperior gifts
wereowing tohishaving partaken ofthissovereign food. This supposition
isquite inharmony with thegeneral drift ofthefatalargument. Thecurse
pronounced upon thedeceiver isplainly addressed toanintelligent agent de-
signedly guilty ofanenormous crime, andwould have beenunmeaning and
unworthy oftheDivine character, ifaddressed toamere animal, which, in
following the instincts ofitsnature, hadunconsciously raised seductive
thoughts inthemind ofthewoman.
That, however, thephraseology ofthecurse isinitsouter sense applied to
thecondition oftheserpent, while initsinner meaning terribly significant to
theintelligent agent, seems tousvery clearly toshow lhat theserpent was
really, andnotfiguratively, employed inthisawful transaction. Themore


book ix. 363
closely thelanguage ofthecurse isexamined, themore real itspurport, as
addressed totheintelligent agent ofthetemptation, under forms ofspeech
adapted totheserpentine condition, willheapparent. The closing portion
ofit"Iwillputenmity between theeandthewoman, andbetween thy
«eedandherseed :it(he) shall bruise thyhead, andthou shalt bruise his
leel," could have nosignificance with reference merely totheserpent; but
totherealtempter itwasofawful importance. They werewords toshake
Hell,andtofillthearch fiendwith consternation. Itisnotatalllikely that
thefallen pairunderstood these words nearly sowell ashedid
;yeteven to
them itmust have appeared that itpromised some great andcrowning
triumph to"the seedofthewoman." andperhaps arecovery from the fall,
after theenemy hadseemed foratime totriumph overhim,andto''bruise
hisheel." Butweknow itsmeaning better, probably, than either the first
oairorevenSatan didthen.Wecanseethat itwasthe firstgospel promise,
foretelling thesufferings ofChrist andhisfinaltriumph over theEvilOne;
hisvictory inourbehalf, bysuffering.

shadow, sointhe light oftheDivine government sincasts thedismal
shadow ofdeath. Misery here denotes anyofthose sufferings anddiseases
which undermine health and life.
13.Sad task, yetargument :TheParadise Lost, even inthis latter partof
it,concerning God's anger andAdam's distress, isamore heroic subject than
thewrath ofAchilles onhisfoe,Hector, whom hepursued three times round
thewalls ofTroy, according toHomer ;orthan therage ofTurnus for
Lavinia disespoused (17),having been first betrothed tohim, and after-
wards promised toJEnezs, according toVirgil ;orNeptune's irethat so
longperplexed theGreek, Ulysses, asweread intheOdyssey;orJuno's ire
(18 >,that forsomany years perplexed Cytherea's son,iEneas, asweread at
large intheiEneid. The anger thatheisabout tosing isanargument
(subject) more heroic notonlythan theanger ofmen, ofAchilles and
Turnus, butthan thateven of.the gods, ofNeptune andJuno. Theanger
ofthetrueGod isamore noble subject than thaioffalse gods. Inthis re-

BOOK X.
THEARGUMENT.
Man's transgression known, theguardian angels forsake Paradise, andre-
turnuptoHeaven toapprove their vigilance, andareapproved, Goddeclaring
thattheentrance ofSatan could notbebythem prevented. Hesends his
Sontojudge thetransgressors, whodescends andgives sentence accordingly;
then inpity clothes them both, andre-ascends. SinandDeath, sitting till
then atthegates ofHell,bywondrous sympathy feeling thesuccess ofSatan
inthisnewworld, andthesinbyMan there committed, resolve tositno
longer confined inHell, buttofollow Satan, their sire,uptotheplace ofMan.
Tomake theway easier from Hell tothisworld toand fro,theypave a
broad highway orbridge over Chaos, according tothetrack that Satan first
made ;then, preparing forEarth, theymeet him,proud ofhissuccess, re-
turning toHell ;theirmutual gratulation. Satan arrives atPandemonium;in
fullassembly relates with boasting hissuccess against Man;instead ofap-
plause, isentertained with ageneral hissbyallhisaudience, transformed
with himself alsosuddenly into serpents, according tohisdoom given in
Paradise;then, deluded with ashow oftheforbidden treespringing upbefore
them, they, greedily reaching totake ofthe fruit,chew dustandbitter ashes.
Theproceedings ofSinandDeath ;God foretells thefinal victory ofhisSon
overthem, andtherenewing ofallthings ;butforthepresent commands his
angels tomake several alterations intheheavens andelements. Adam, more
andmore perceiving hisfallen condition, heavily bewails, rejects thecondole-
ment ofEve;she persists, and atlength appeases him ;then, toevade the
curse likely tofallontheir offspring, proposes toAdam violent ways, which
heapproves not ;but,conceiving better hope, puts her inmind ofthelate
promise made them, thatherSeedshould berevenged ontheSerpent ;and
exhorts herwithhim toseekpeace oftheoffended Deity, byrepentance and
supplication.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Certainly Milton hasinthisBook shown toanamazing extent allthe
variety ofhispowers instriking contrast with each other: thesublimity of
thecelestial persons ;thegigantic wickedness oftheinfernal ;themingled
excellence andhuman infirmities ofAdam andEve ;andtheshadowy and
terrific beings, SinandDeath. Ofanyother poet, theimagination would
have been exhausted inthepreceding Books;inMilton, itstill gathers
strength andgrows bolder andbolder, anddartswithmore expanded wings.
When SinandDeath deserted thegates ofHell,andmade theirway toEarth,
theconception andexpression ofallthecircumstances areofasupernatural
force.
Iseenoadequate reasonwhy thewhole ofanEpicpoem should (may)
notconsist ofallegorical orshadowy beings;nordoIseewhythey should
(may) notbemixed inaction with those imaginary persons who represent
realities. Certainly thepoetical parts oftheScriptures everywhere embody
suchshadowy existences. (Seenoteon230.)
SinandDeath might have flowrnthrough the airfrom Hell toEarth, as
shadowrypersonifications, without theaidofabridge ofmatter ;but this
ought nottohave prohibited thepoetfrom picturing abridge ofmatter, if
hisimagination ledhim tothatdevice. Itwasintended totypify thefacility
ofaccess contrived bySinandDeath from Hell tothis terrestrial globe, not
only forthemselves, butfor alltheir ministers andinnumerable followers.
Themoral isobvious :what isintended tobeconveyed is,though figuratively
told, inperfect concurrence with ourfaith, instead ofshocking it.Wemust
cutaway allthemost impressive parts ofpoetry, ifwedonotallow these
figurative inventions.
Itmaybeadmitted that itrequires arichmind duly toenjoy andappre-
ciate these grand and spiritual agencies. They, therefore, whohave cold
conceptions, eagerly catch hold ofthese censures tojustify theirown insen-
sibility; theycanunderstand illustrations drawn from objects daily insolid
forms before their eyes. But itisnotonly inthedescription offorms and
actions thatthebardhasastrength andbrilliance sowonderful ;heisequally
happy inthesentiments heattributes toeach personage. Allspeak their
own distinct characters, with ajustness andindividuality which meet instant
recognition, andwaken anindescribable assent andpleasure. ThusAdam


BOOK X. 41?
andEve,when theyknow thedispleasure oftheAlmighty, andareover-
whelmed with fearandremorse, each express themselves according totheir
separate casts ofmind, disposition, andcircumstances :theirmoans aredeeply
affecting. Tomytaste, thisBook ismuch more loftyandmuch more pa-
thetic, than theNinth :asthesubject wasmuch more difficult, soitis
executed withmuch more wonderful vigour andoriginality.
Thewhole of"Paradise Lost," from beginning toend, ispartofoneinse-
parable web ;andhowever beautiful detached partsmay appear, nothalf
their genius orwisdom canbefeltorunderstood except inconnexion with
thewhole.
Such istheerudition applied tothismostwonderful work, thatnothing less
than theconjoined attempts ofawhole body oflearned men foracentury
havebeen able toexplain itsinexhaustible allusions ;andeven yetthetask
isuotcompleted.—E.B.

character isleftunconsidered, and allthat isthought ofisitsissue. And
thus, indulging inthevery spiritwhich ledtothetransgression ofthelaw.
menjudge ofitscharacter byitsresults. The firsttransgressors acted onthe
persuasion that,judging bythefallacious advantage ofitsviolation, itwould
bebetter tobreak itthan tokeep it.Their posterity areapttothink that
itwould havebeen better had itnotbeen enacted;both uniting intheim-
plied sentiment, thatman's will,andnotGod's, should rule. The firstlaw
appears tobeasgood atest still,ofman's moral disposition, asitwasonthe
dayofitsDivine appointment.
Dr.Harris further remarks, that theparticular prohibition wasonly the
indirect occasion oftransgression. Thesame spirit ofdisobedience would
have been developed, itmaybeassumed, insome other manner (although
notnecessarily) ,even ifthatprohibition hadnever existed. Indeed thepro-
bability is,thattheprobationary arrangement didnoteven hasten themoment
oftransgression, butactually delayed it:forhadnottheentrance ofevilbeen
provided against atevery avenue save one,thelikelihood isthat itwould,
inhowever amitigated form, have earlier made itsappearance. Neither
must itbeimagined thattheoutward actitself constituted theguilt ofthe
firsttransgressor. Thiswasonly theexternal manifestation ofthe fatal
change within. Hadtheforbidden object eluded hisgrasp, orvanished from
hissight asheessayed totake it,thesinwould yethave beencompleted in
purpose, and, therefore, intheeyeofGodandofconscience, though still in-
complete inoutward andmuscular action. Sothat theconsequences which
ensued arenottobeviewed asresulting from theoutward breach ofaposi-
tivelaw,however reasonable andbenevolent thatlawmight be,butfrom
thatbreach asindicating theinternal change ofman's nature, orhisdisregard
tothewillofGodformally andsolemnly expressed.

Sospake thisOracle, then verify 'd
175.This istaken from Genesis iii.14,15.The object ofthecurse inthis
casewasboth thenatural visible serpent employed astheinstrument, and
Satan himself, bywhom hewas instigated. Itwasnottheserpent alone,
andbyitself, thattempted the firstpair;itwas that animal, asmoved and
impelled bythedevil,which accomplished their ruin. Theexpressions used
indenouncing thesentence, appertain toboth :notthatabrute reptile could
really beguilty ofsin,orafitsubject ofpunishment, but itisentirely inac-
cordance with theusualmethod oftheDivine dispensations toputsome
token ofdispleasure upon theinstrument ofanoffence, aswell asupon the
offender whoemploys it.Thus thebeastwhohadbeen lainwithbyman,
Lev. xx.15,was tobeburned todeath aswell asthemanhimself; andeven
thecensers ofKorah andhiscompanions werecondemned asnolonger fitto
beapplied toasacred use. This isdone inorder toexpress more forcibly
theDivine detestation oftheact,while atthesame timewemay freely ad-
mitthatthemain weight ofthecurse undoubtedly fellupon theprincipal
agent, whose doom ismystically expressed intheterms appropriate toa
natural serpent. Itmay further beobserved, injustification oftheDivine
proceeding, that thebrute serpent, inpursuance ofthiscurse, probably suf-
fered nopain. Itmight bedeteriorated astoitsproperties ;itmight be
lowered inthescale ofcreation;itmight betransformed from ashape and
appearance themost beautiful intheeyes ofmen, intoaform themost dis-
gusting;and allthiswithout anydiminution ofitscorporeal pleasures.
Such achange involved nomental suffering, asitwould inthecaseofara-
tional being subjected tolikedegradation.—

existence.—S.
229.Was sinn'd andjudged :Impersonal verbs, constituting aLatin form
ofexpression, andmeaning, sinandjudgment took place.
230. SatSinandDeath, fyc. :Some remarks may here,with propriety, be
made upon theintroduction ofsuchshadowy andimaginary persons into a
heroic poem. Itiscertain thatHomer andVirgil arefullofimaginary per-
sons;andthese arevery beautiful inpoetry, when they arejustshown
without being engaged inany series ofaction. Homer, indeed, represents
sleep asaperson, andascribes ashort part tohim inhisIliad;butwemust
consider thatthough wenow regard such aperson asentirely shadowy and
unsubstantial, theheathens made statues ofhim, placed him intheirtem-
ples,andlooked uponhim asareal deity. When Homer makes useof
similar allegorical persons, itisonly inshort, expressions which convey an
ordinary thought tothemind inthemost pleasing manner, andmay rather
belooked upon aspoetical phrases than allegorical descriptions. Instead of
telling usthatmen naturally fleewhen they are terrified, heintroduces the
persons ofFlight andFear asinseparable companions. Instead ofsaying
that thetimewascomewhen Apollo ought tohave received hisrecom-
pence. hetells usthat theHours brought him hisreward. Instead ofde-
scribing theeffects ofMinerva's ;Tgisproduced inbattle, hetells usthatthe
brims ofitwere encompassed byTerror, Rout. Discord, Fury. Pursuit, Mas-
sacre, andDeath. Inthesame figure ofspeaking, herepresents Victory as
follow ingDiomedes ;Discord, asthemother offunerals andofmourning;
Venus, asdressed bytheGraces. Similar instances aretobefound inVirgil.

Butthatsuccess attends him; ifmishap,
Ere thishehadreturn 'd,with furydriven 240
Byhisavengers, since noplace like this
Can fithispunishment, ortheir revenge.
Milton hasvery oftenmade useofthesamewayofspeaking ;aswhere he
tells usthat Victory satontherighthand oftheMessiah, when hemarched
forth against therebel angels ;that, attherising ofthesun,theHours
unbarred thegates oflight ;thatDiscord wasthedaughter ofSin. Ofthe
same nature arethose expressions, where, describing thesinging ofthenight-
ingale, headds, "Silence was pleased;" andupon theMessiah's bidding
peace totheChaos, "Confusion heard hisvoice." There arenumberless
instances ofourauthor's writing inthis beautiful figure. Itisplain that
thesewhich havebeen mentioned, inwhich persons ofanimaginary nature
areintroduced, aresuch short allegories asarenotdesigned tobetaken in
theliteral sense, butonly toconvey particular circumstances tothereader
after anunusual andentertaining manner. Butwhen such persons arein-
troduced asprincipal actors, andengaged inaseries ofadventures, they take
toomuch uponthem, andare,bynomeans, proper foraheroic poem, which
ought toappear credible initsprincipal parts.—A.
Theopinions justexpressed differ, itwillbenoticed, from those contained
intheIntroductory Remarks, prefixed tothisBook ;andalsofrom those ex-
pressed byBishop Newton, andhere subjoined.
Milton may rather bejustified forintroducing such imaginary beings as
SinandDeath, because agreat partofhispoem lies intheinvisible world,
andsuch fictitious beings may better have aplace there;andtheactions of
ofSinandDeath areatleast asprobable asmany ofthose ascribed tothe
good orevilangels. Besides, asMilton's subject necessarily admitted sofar
realpersons, hewas inamanner obliged tosupply that defect byintroduc-
ingimaginary ones;andthecharacters ofSinandDeath areperfectly agree-
able tothehints andsketches, which aregiven ofthem inScripture. The
Scripture hadmade persons ofthem before inseveral places ;only itrepre-
sented them, asImay say, inminiature, andhehasdrawn them intheir
fulllength andproportions.—N.

578-79 Itdeserves remark, says Kitto, that inmost oftheaccounts ofthe
dragon, orserpent, whom theheathen regarded asthesource ofevil,heis
called Typhon, orPython, awordwhich signifies"toover-persuade, tode-
ceive." Now, thisveryname Pitho orPython, designates thegreat deceiver
ofmankind. When thedamsel atPhilippi issaid tohavebeen possessed by
"aspirit ofdivination," itiscalled, intheoriginal, ''aspirit ofPython,'
manifestly showing thatthepagan Python was,andcould be,noother than
"thatOldSerpent, called theDevil andSatan, which deceiveth thewhole
world" (Rev. xii. 9).
5S0-84. Ourauthor isendeavouring toshow thattherewassome tradition

Eurynome. hesays,hadfirst theruleofhighOlympus, andwere driven thence
bySaturn and Ops. orRhea, ereyettheir son,Dictaan Jove, was born, so
called from Dicte, amountain ofCrete, where hewas educated. Milton
seems tohavetaken thisstory from Apollonius Rhodius.
Now Ophion, according totheGreek etymology, signifies aserpent, and
therefore Milton conceives thatbyOphion theOldSerpent might beintended,
theserpent whom they called Ophion; andEurynome, signifying wide-ruling, he
says, bitsays doubtfully, thatshemight bethewide-encroaching Eveperhaps.
This epithet isapplied toEve, toshow thesimilitude between herandEu-
rynome, andwhyhetakes theonefortheother; andtherefore, inallusion to

Mary Powell, asawife,was quite hasty, andproved tobeadverse tohis
happiness. Being strongly attached, like allherfamily, totheroyalist party,
andaccustomed totheaffluent hospitality ofherfather's house, shesoon
became tired ofastudious, recluse, andrepublican husband. After amonth's
experience ofhernew life,shesighed forthegaieties shehad leftbehind,
and,bytheearnest reruest ofherrelatives, obtained permission topaya
short visit toForest Hill, herfather's residence, inOxfordshire. Butwhen
theperiod fixed forherreturn arrived, sheevinced nodisposition tokeep
herword, but,onthecontrary, treated herhusband's letter with silence, and
sentback hismessenger with disdain. [Edinburgh Encycl'opcedia.] The
royalist party beingnow intheascendant, thePowells were themore in-
clined, onthat account, tobreak their connection with Milton, andMilton
wasprovoked toform thescheme ofrepudiating awifewhohaddeserted
himwithout justgrounds Probably toprepare theway forthis act,he
wrote several treatises invindication ofdivorce, onother grounds besides
adultery. Hehadbegun, also, topayaddresses toanother lady,with the
intention ofseeking herhand inmarriage. ThePowells hearing ofthis,
andhaving metwith disasters andlosses intherecent defeat oftheroyalist
cause, were eager tobring about areconciliation with thepoet,whomight
aidthem intheirnowbroken fortunes. Milton's wife repaired tothehoise
ofoneofhisrelatives, whom, assheknew, herhusband often visited, and
awaited hisarrival. Greatwas hissurprise tomeet herthere, andespecially
forsuch apurpose. Itissaid thatshethrew herself athisfeet, confessed,
inthemosthumble manner, her fault, and,with flowing tears, supplicated
hisforgiveness.
Atfirstheappeared tobeunmoved andinexorable ;but, atlength, the
generosity ofhistemper, andtheintercession ofsome mutual friends, con-
quered hisanger, andaperfect reconciliation took place, with thepromise
ofoblivion ofeverything which hadhappened. Her relatives, onpolitical
grounds, itissupposed, being oftheopposite party from herhusband, had,
probably, been theprincipal cause ofthese domestic troubles, though Milton

THEARGUMENT.
TheSonofGod presents tohisFather theprayers ofour first parents,
now repenting, andintercedes forthem ;Godaccepts them, butdeclares that
theymust nolonger abide inParadise;sends Michael with aband ofCheru-
bim todispossess them ;but first toreveal toAdam future things;Michael's
coming down; Adam shews toEve certain ominous signs; hediscerns
Michael's approach;goes outtomeethim ;theAngel denounces their de-
parture;Eve's lamentation ;Adam pleads, butsubmits ;theAngel leads
himuptoahigh hill ;sets before him invision what shall happen tillthe
flood.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
Probably there islessinvention inthisthan insome other Books, but
thedescriptive parts arenotlesspowerful, nor lessimportant, instructive,
andawful intheir topics. TheDeluge wasatrial ofstrength with the
ancients, since itforms soimportant afeature inOvid's poems. Sofaras
there isinvention inthisBook, itliesintheselection ofcircumstances, in
picturesque epithets, and inmoral, political, and religious reflections. Its
intellectual compass isvast andstupendous. Such aview opened upon
Adam ofthefaleofhisposterity, ascould onlybeconceived andcompre-
hended bythesplendid force ofthepoetical eyeofMilton.
Itistruly saidthatMilton everywhere follows thegreat ancients, andim-
proves upon them. Hedespises allthepetty gildings and artifices which
aresomuch boasted inmodern poetry. Hisobject is,toconvey images and
ideas, notwords ;andtheplainer thewords, sothattheydonotdisgrace the
thought, thebetter. Hewould- never sacrifice theforce ofthelanguage to
themetre. Themark ofthis is,thatwhen hehadoccasion tousetheterms
ofScripture, hewould notderange them forthesake oftherhyme.—E.B.

12.Deucalion wasaThessalian prince, who,with hiswifePyrrha, escaped
thegeneral flood thathappened inhistimes, 1541, bc.This isoneofthe
firstevents recorded inprofane history. Alltheinhabitants, except these
two,having been destroyed, they consulted theoracle ofThemis, theGod-
dessofJustice, toascertain bywhat means thehuman racemight bere-
stored. Onbeing ordered tothrow stones behind them, those thrown by
Deucalion became men, andthose byPyrrha women. Inthis fable the
history ofsome partial inundation seems tobeconfounded with thetradition
oftheuniversal deluge. Inthat beautifiul odededicated toAugustus (Book
i.2) ,inwhich richness ofimagery andelegance oflanguage viewith the
loftiest toneofmorality, Horace thus alludes totheflood ofDeucalion.

immediate departure from thegarden ofEden, thepoet's artinpreserving

lence ofungovernable sorrow, breaks forth intoapathetic apostrophe to
Paradise. Adam expresses without afigure hisregret forbeing banished
" from thishappy place, oursweet
Recess,"' &c. 304.
Theuseoftheapostrophe intheone case,and itsomission intheother,
notonly gives abeautiful variety tothestyle, butalsomarks that superior
elevation andcomposure ofmind bywhich thepoethad allalong distin-
guished thecharacter ofAdam.—

ifthey canfindnoother object, will, rather than besilent, pour themselves
forth towoods, androcks, andthemost insensible things;especially ifthese

some interpreters have conceived theguilt ofCain toconsist. The poet
toomakes them offer both upon thesame altar, fortheword brought, in
Scripture ^which Milton likewise retains,isunderstood oftheir bringing
their offerings tosomecommon place ofworship ;andthis altar hemakes
ofturf,ofgrassy sord (sward) ,asthe first altars arerepresented tobe,and
describes thesacrifice somewhat inthemanner ofHomer. The Scripture
says only, that''theLordhad respect untoAbeland tohisoffering /butunto
Cainand tohisoffering hehadnotrespect." Thepoetmakes thisrespect to
Abel's offering tobeafirefromHeaven consuming it.There areseveral
instances ofsuchacceptance inScripture. Cain's wasnotsoaccepted
;for.
says thepoet, hiswasnotsincere.—N.
Themore important reason forthisnon-acceptance was, thatinAbel's case
therewastheexercise offaith inGod (probably inthepredicted Messiah,
indicated bythekind ofoffering hepresented—ananimal sacrifice) ,while,
inthatofCain therewasnosuch faith, noroutward manifestation ofit.

THEARGUMENT.
TheAngel Michael continues, from theflood, to ielatewhat shall succeed
;
then, inthemention ofAbraham, comes bydegrees toexplain who that
Seed oftheWoman shall be,which waspromised Adam andEve inthe
fall; hisincarnation, death, resurrection, andascension; thestate ofthe
Church tillhissecond coming ;Adam, greatly satisfied andcomforted by
these relations andpromises, descends the hillwithMichael ;wakens Eve,
who allthiswhile hadslept, butwith gentle dreams composed toquietness
ofmind andsubmission ;Michael ineither hand leadsthem outofPara-
dise, thefierysword waving behind them, andtheCherubim taking their
stations toguard theplace.


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
TheEleventh andTwelfth Books arebuiltupon thesingle circumstance
oftheremoval ofour firstparents from Paradise ;butthough this isnotin
itself sogreat asubject asthat inmost oftheforegoing Books, itisextended
anddiversified with somany surprising incidents andpleasing episodes, that
these lasttwoBooks canbynomeans belooked upon asunequal parts of
thisdivine poem. Itmaybeadded, that,hadnotMilton represented our
firstparents asdriven outofParadise, hisfellofmanwould nothave been
complete, and,consequently, hisaction would havebeen imperfect.—A.
Butthere isanother topic ofremark which theconcluding Book ofMil-
ton's divine poem suggests :itishiscomparative affluence ofinvention. The
sentence uponAdam might have been attended byimmediate expulsion
;
buthow gracious isthedivine condescension, toallow some interval ofre-
flection, and,previously toejectment, tofortify theminds oftherepentant
pairwith anticipated knowledge anddistant consolation !Thus theinterest
ofthepoem iskept alivewith thereader tothe last line.Thewhole of
theTwelfth Book closely relates toAdam andhisposterity ;andsodelight-
fularethese soothing hopes ofhappiness administered bythearchangel,
thatwe,equally withAdam, forget thatwearetoquit Paradise, andare,
likehim, heart-struck bythesudden warning, that "thehour iscome, the
veryminute ofit;"andattend the"hastening angel, tothegates ofexclu-
sion,with allthesadandlingering acquiescence ofour firstparents."—E.B.

Then with transition sweetnewspeech resumes. 5
Thus thou hastseenoneworld begin andend;
Andman, asfrom asecond stock, proceed.

two, thenarration went onwithout anyinterruption ;butupon thatdivision

gins theBook very gracefully, and is,indeed (toapply theauthor's own
words) .asweet transition.—N.

theParadisaical state isthegolden one :thatofironbegins soon (24).—R.
24. Tillone shall rise, fyc. :Itisgenerally agreed thatthe firstgovern-
ments oftheworld were patriarchal, byfamilies and tribes ;andthatNim-
rodwas the firstwho laid thefoundations ofkingly government among
mankind. Ourauthor, therefore (whowasnofriend tokingly government
atthebest), represents him inaverybad light, asamostwicked andinso-
lenttyrant ;buthehasgreat authorities, bothJewish andChristian, tojus-
tifyhim forsodoing. The Scripture saysofNimrod, Gen. x.9.that "he
wasamighty hunter before theLord." And thisourauthor understands in
itsworst sense ofhunting men, andnotbeasts (30),bypersecution, oppres-
sion,andtyranny. The phrase, before theLord, seems tobemade useofby
way ofexaggeration, and inabad sense, asinGen. xiii.13;xxxviii. 7.
And St.Austin translates thephrase, against theLord, towhich opinion our
author conforms, asindespite ofHeaven (34\ butthenadopts theopinion of
others also, that before theLord i«thesame asunder theLord, usurping all
authority tohimself next under God,andclaiming it,jure Divino, aswas
done inMilton's own time ;orfrom Heaven claiming second sovereignty,

limping carriage ofVulcan inwaiting. Iliad i.599,which Pope thus trans-
lates :
"Vulcan withawkward grace hisoffice plies.
Andunextinguished laughter shakes theskies.''
But, asMr.Thyer adds, itisrather toocomic forthegrave character of
Milton's gods, toberepresented aspeeping down andlaughing, like aparcel

with supposing Adam .tohave aprospect ofitbefore hiseyes, nextbymak-

duce thesame kind ofconsolation inthereader, whocannot peruse this last

With dreadful faces throng'd and fiery arms.

Their place ofrest,andProvidence their guide.

commonly mean by it,butasword, asitisused intheFaery Queen of
Spenser: "Which steely brand that allother swords excelled;" and
also inothermore recent authors. Brando, inItalian, signifies asword; so
called, asJunius thinks, because menfought with burnt stakes andfirebrands
before armswere invented.—N.

butthegeneral guidance ofProvidence tokeepthem safeandunhurt.—P.

649. Solitary way :Itwas solitary, notinregard toanycompanions whom
theyhadmetwith elsewhere, butbecause theywere here tomeetwith no
object ofanykindtheywere acquainted with, XI.305—P.Oritwas sol-
itary inreference tothecompanionship ofMichael.
647—49. Ithasbeen objected tothese lines, thattheyendthepoem intoo
sorrowful amanner, andthatthey areinconsistent with other passages in
thisBook, which describe thejoy, thepeace, andconsolation ofour first
parents. Butthese emotions, asDr.Pierce remarks, arerepresented always
asarising inour firstparents from aview ofsome future good, chiefly ofthe
Messiah ;while thethought ofleaving Paradise wasalways asorrowful
onetothem, 613,638, 645,603.
Astothefirst-named objection, there is,saysNewton, nomore necessity
that anepicpoem should conclude happily, than there isthat atragedy
should conclude unhappily. There areseveral instances ofatragedy ending
happily ;andwith asgood reason, anepicpoemmayterminate fortunately
orunfortunately, asthenature ofthesubject requires ;andthesubject of
Paradise Lostplainly requires something ofasorrowful parting, andwas in-
tended, nodoubt, forterror aswell aspity—toinspire uswith thefearof
God, aswell aswithcommiseration ofman.
Newton further callsustoobserve thebeauty ofthenumbers inthese
concluding lines—theheary dragging ofthe first line,which cannot bepro-
nounced butslowly, andwith several pauses:
"They|hand inhand,|withwand'ring steps,|andslow,''
|
andthen thequicker flowofthe last line,with only theusual pause inthe
middle. As ifour firstparents hadmoved heavily atfirst,being loath to
leave their delightful Paradise ;andafterwards mended their pace,when
theywere atalittle distance. Atleast this istheideawhich thenumbers
convey. Thevarying ofthepauses, isthe lifeand soulofallversification,
inalllanguages. Itisthis chiefly which makes Virgil's verse better than
Ovid's, andMilton's superior tothatofanyother English poet ;and itisfor
want ofthischiefly thattheFrench heroic verse cannever comeuptothe
English. There canbenogood poetry without music, andthere canbeno
music without variety.


CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.
Nojustheroic poem ever was, orcanbemade, whence onegreat moral
may notbededuced. Thatwhich reigns inMilton isthemost general and
most useful thatcanbeimagined. Itis,inshort, this :that obkdience to
THEWILL OFGodMAKES MEN HAPPY, ANDTHAT DISOBEDIENCE MAKES
them miserable. This isobviously themoral oftheprincipal story
which turns uponAdam andEve,who continued inParadise while they
kept thecommand thatwasgiven them, andwere driven outofitassoon
asthey transgressed. This islikewise themoral oftheprincipal episode,
which shows ushow aninnumerable multitude ofangels fellbytheir
disobedience.
Besides thisgreat moral, whichmayberegarded asthesoulofthestory,
there isaninfinity ofunder-morals, whichmaybedrawn from theseveral
parts ofthepoem, rendering thisworkmore useful andinstructive thanany
otherpoem inanylanguage.—A.
Throughout thewhole poem theauthor discovers himself tohavebeen a
most critical reader, andamost passionate admirer, ofholy Scripture. He
isindebted toScripture infinitely more than toHomer and Virgil, and all
other books whatever. Notonly hisprincipal story, but allhisepisodes are
founded onScripture. The Scripture hasnotonly furnished himwith the
noblest hints, raised histhoughts, and fired hisimagination, buthasalso
verymuch enriched hislanguage, given acertain solemnity andmajesty to
hisdiction, andsupplied himwithmany ofhischoicest, happiest expres-
sions. Letmen, therefore, learn from thisinstance toreverence those sacred
writings. Ifanymancanpretend toderide ordespise them, itmust besaid
ofhim atleast, thathehasatasteandgenius themost different from Mil-
ton's thatcanbeimagined. Whoever hasanytrue tasteandgenius, weare
confident, willesteem thispoem thebestofmodern productions, andthe
Scriptures thebest ofallancient ones.—N.


THELIFEOFMILTON AGREAT EPIC ITSELF.
Letusglance foramoment atwhat waseven finer than Milton's trans-
cendent genius—hischaracter. His lifewas agreat epic itself. Byron's
lifewasatragic comedy;Sheridan's wasabrilliant farce;Shelley's wasa
wild, mad, stormy tragedy ;Keats' lifewas asad, brief, beautiful lyric;
Moore's hasbeen alove song ;Coleridge's wasa"Midsummer Night's
Dream ;"Schiller's wasaharsh, difficult, wailing, butultimately victorious
war ode, likeoneofPindar's ;Goethe's was abrilliant, somewhat melo-
dramatic, butfinished novel ;Tasso's wasanelegy ;butMilton, andMilton
alone, acted aswell aswrote anepiccomplete inallitsparts—high, grave,
sustained, majestic. His lifewas aself-denied life. "Susceptible," says
one, "asBurke, totheattractions ofhistorical prescription, ofroyalty, of
chivalry, ofanancient church, installed incathedrals and illustrated byold
martyrdoms, hethrew himself, theflower ofelegance, onthesideofthe
reeking conventicle—theside ofhumanity, unlearned andunadorned." It
wasalifeoflabour and toil ;labour and toilunrewarded, savebythesecret
sunshine ofhisown breast, filledwith theconsciousness ofdivine approba-
tion,andhearing from afarthevoice ofuniversal future fame.
Itwasalifeofpurity. Even inhisyouth, and inthecountries ofthe
south, heseems tohaveremained unsullied. Although noanchorite, hewas
temperate. Rapid inhismeals, hewasnever weary oftherefreshment of
music ;hisfavourite instrument, asmight have been expected, being the
organ. Itwasalifenotperfect; there were spots onhisfame—acerbities
oftemper, harshness oflanguage, peculiarities ofopinion, which proved him
human, andgrappled himwith difficulty toearth, likeavast balloon ere it
takes itsflight upward.
Itwas the lifeofapatriot, "faithful foundamong thefaithless, faithful
onlyhe;"andAbdiel, thatdreadless angel, isjustMilton transferred tothe
skies. Itwas,above all,the lifeofaChristian ;itwas the lifeofprayer,
offaith, ofmeek dependence, ofperpetual communing withHeaven.
Thus faintly havewepictured John Milton. Forgive us,mighty shade !

Infine,wetellnotourreaders toimitate Milton's genius :thatmaybe
toohigh athing forthem;buttoimitate his life—thepatriotism, thesin-
cerity, themanliness, thepurity, andthepiety ofhischaracter. When con-

were giants inthose days," whilewehave fallen onthedays oflittlemen;
nay, tocryoutwith herofold,"Isawgods ascending from theearth, and

those days ofrapid anduniversal change, what need foraspirit sopure, so

ofWordsworth?
•'Milton !thou shouldst beliving atthishour.

STRICTURES UPON DR.JOHNSON'S CRITICISM.
Johnson's criticism, inserted inhis"Life ofMilton," issouniversally
known, that Ishall notrepeat ithere ;itshows the critic tohave been a
master oflanguage, andofperspicuity, andmethod ofideas ;ithas not.
however, the sensibility, thegrace, andthenice perceptions ofAddison :it
isanalytical anddry.As itdoes notillustrate anyoftheabstract positions
bycited instances, itrequires aphilosophical mind tofeel itsfullforce ;it
haswrapped upthepraises, which were popularly expressed byAddison, in
language adapted tothelearned. The truth is,thatJohnson's headwas
more theparent ofthatpanegyric than hisheart. Hespeaks byrule ;and
byruleheisforced toadmire. Rules arevain towhich theheart does not
assent. Many oftheattractions ofMilton's poem arenot atallindicated
bythegeneral words ofJohnson. From Addison's critique wecanlearn
distinctly itscharacter andcolours ;wecanbetaught how toappreciate;


CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 541
andcanjudgebytheexamples produced, how farourownsympathies go
with thecommentator. Wecannot read, therefore, without being made
converts, where thecomment isright. Itisnotonly inthegrand outline
thatMilton's mighty excellence lies :itisinfilling upalltheparts even to
theleast minutie. The images, thesentiments, thelong argumentative
passages, are alladmirable, taken separately ;theyform adouble force, as
essential parts ofonelarge andmagnificent whole. Theimages areoftwo
sorts, inventive andreflective;the first are,ofcourse, ofthehighest order.
Ifourconceptions were confined towhat reality andexperience haveim-
pressed upon us,ourminds would benarrow, andourfaculties without light.
Thepower ofinventive imagination approaches tosomething above hu-
manity :itmakes usparticipant ofother worlds andother states ofbeing.
Stillmere invention isnothing, unless itsquality behigh and beautiful.
Shakspeare's invention was inthemosteminent degree rich ;but still itwas
merehuman invention. The invention ofthecharacter ofSalan, andof
thegoodandbadangels, andoftheseats ofbliss, andofPandemonium, and
ofChaos, andofthegates ofHell, andofSinandDeath, andother super-
natural agencies, isunquestionably ofafarloftier andmore astonishing
order.
Though theartsofcompositions, carried onestepbeyond thepointwhich
brings outthethought most clearly and forcibly, doharm rather than good,
yetuptothispoint they areofcourse great aids ;and allthese Milton pos-
sessed intheutmost perfection :allthestrength oflanguage, allitsturns,
breaks, andvarieties—allitsflows andharmonies, and allitslearned allu-
sions, were his. InPope there isamonotony andtechnical mellifluence :
inMilton there isstrength with harmony, andsimplicity with elevation.
He isnever stilted, never gilded with tinsel, never morecramped than ifhe
were writing inprose ;and,while hehas alltheelevation, hehas allthe
freedom ofunshackled language. Torender metre during alongpoem un-
fatiguing, there must beaninfinite diversity ofcombinations ofsound and
position ofwords, which noEnglish bard butMilton hasreached. John-
son,assuming thattheEnglish heroic lineought toconsist ofiambrics, has
tried itbyfalse tests :itadmits asmany varied feetastheOdes ofHorace;
andsoscanned, allMilton's lines areaccented right.
Ifweconsider the "Paradise Lost" with respect toinstruction, itisthe
deepest and thewisest ofalltheuninspired poems which were ever written ;and
whatpoem candogoodwhich does notsatisfy theunderstanding? Ofal-
most allotherpoems itmaybesaid, thatthey areintended more fordelight
than instruction;andinstruction inpoetry will notdowithout delight; yet
when tothehighest delight isadded themost profound instruction, what
fame canequal thevalue ofthecomposition ?Such, unquestionably, isthe
compound merit ofthe "Paradise Lost." Itisadutyimperative onhim
whohasanintellect capable ofreceiving this instruction, nottoneglect the
cultivation ofit :inhimwhounderstands theEnglish language, theneglect
tostudy thispoem istheneglect ofapositive duty :here istobefound in
combination what canbelearned nowhere else.

hastheeffrontery toassert, thatthough itmayberead asaduty, itcangive

stigma due tohim. Isanyintellectual delight equal tothatwhich ahigh
and sensitive mind derives from theperusal ofinnumerable passages in
every Book ofhisinimitable work ofpoetical fiction ?Thevery story
