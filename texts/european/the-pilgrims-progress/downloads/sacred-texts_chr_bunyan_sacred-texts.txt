Start Reading
Pilgrim's Progress
 is an allegory of a Christian's journey
 (here represented by a character called 'Christian') from the
 "City of Destruction" to the "Celestial City".
 Along the way he visits such locations as the Slough of
 Despond, Vanity Fair, the Doubting Castle,
 and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
Bunyan, the author, had very little formal education and a humble background.
 Nonetheless Pilgrim's Progress is considered one of the masterpieces of
 English literature, and is required reading for Christians who are on
 the spritual path in a world of temptations.
