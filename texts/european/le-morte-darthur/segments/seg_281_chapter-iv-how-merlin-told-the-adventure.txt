CHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.

At that time there was a knight, the which was the king’s son of
Ireland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight,
and counted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great
despite at Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be
accounted more hardy, or more of prowess; and he asked King Arthur if
he would give him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite
that he had done. Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with
Balin; I would he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and
to my court. Then this Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready.
In the meanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there
was told him the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of
the Lake. Now shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that here
standeth, that brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the
cause of her coming: she was the falsest damosel that liveth. Say not
so, said they. She hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and
a full true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her to
paramour, and this good knight her brother met with the knight that
held her to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands. When this
false damosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion,
and besought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.
