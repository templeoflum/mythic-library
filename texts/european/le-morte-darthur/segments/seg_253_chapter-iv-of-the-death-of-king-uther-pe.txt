CHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.

Then within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in
the meanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon
his men, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie
so as ye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an
horse-litter: for ye shall never have the better of your enemies but if
your person be there, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was
done as Merlin had devised, and they carried the king forth in an
horse-litter with a great host towards his enemies. And at St. Albans
there met with the king a great host of the North. And that day Sir
Ulfius and Sir Brastias did great deeds of arms, and King Uther’s men
overcame the Northern battle and slew many people, and put the remnant
to flight. And then the king returned unto London, and made great joy
of his victory. And then he fell passing sore sick, so that three days
and three nights he was speechless: wherefore all the barons made great
sorrow, and asked Merlin what counsel were best. There is none other
remedy, said Merlin, but God will have his will. But look ye all barons
be before King Uther to-morn, and God and I shall make him to speak. So
on the morn all the barons with Merlin came to-fore the king; then
Merlin said aloud unto King Uther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king
after your days, of this realm with all the appurtenance? Then Uther
Pendragon turned him, and said in hearing of them all, I give him God’s
blessing and mine, and bid him pray for my soul, and righteously and
worshipfully that he claim the crown, upon forfeiture of my blessing;
and therewith he yielded up the ghost, and then was he interred as
longed to a king. Wherefore the queen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow,
and all the barons.
