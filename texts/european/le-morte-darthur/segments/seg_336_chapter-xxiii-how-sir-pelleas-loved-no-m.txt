CHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the
Damosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.

Sir knight Pelleas, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and
come forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that
shall love you. I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard
hath done me great despite and shame, and there he told her the
beginning and ending, and how he had purposed never to have arisen till
that he had been dead. And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate
her as much as ever I loved her, thanked be our Lord Jesus! Thank me,
said the Damosel of the Lake. Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his
horse, and commanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff
where the Damosel of the Lake would assign. So the Lady Ettard died for
sorrow, and the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved
together during their life days.
