CHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last
smote off his head.

Now take thine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an I
may.

Then they took their horses and came together as it had been the
thunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse, and
lightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he thrust his
horse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse hurled here and
there and fell dead to the ground. And ever Sir Breunor ran after to
have slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and
voided his horse lightly. And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his
shield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad strokes. Then
they rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily
and wisely as two noble knights. For this Sir Breunor was a proved
knight, and had been or then the death of many good knights, that it
was pity that he had so long endured.

Thus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either
were wounded sore. Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir
Tristram and took him in his arms, for he trusted much in his strength.
Then was Sir Tristram called the strongest and the highest knight of
the world; for he was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir
Launcelot was better breathed. So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor
down grovelling, and then he unlaced his helm and struck off his head.
And then all they that longed to the castle came to him, and did him
homage and fealty, praying him that he would abide there still a little
while to fordo that foul custom. Sir Tristram granted thereto. The
meanwhile one of the knights of the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the
haut prince, the which was Sir Breunor’s son, which was a noble knight,
and told him what misadventure his father had and his mother.
