CHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.

So by Merlin’s advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country,
and they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell
which way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King
Ban and Bors’ council they let burn and destroy all the country afore
them, there they should ride.

The King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore
the battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles
and their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away. All
that heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. Then by
counsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride
and lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in
their pavilions. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at
arms! for here be your enemies at your hand!
