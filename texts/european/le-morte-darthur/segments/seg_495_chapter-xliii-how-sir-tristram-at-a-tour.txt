CHAPTER XLIII. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that
Morgan le Fay delivered to him.

Then the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King
Arthur’s knights, and there began a great medley. So came in Sir
Tristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he smote down many
knights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that shield. And when
King Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was
made; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore she was heavy.
Then was there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur,
and when she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake
openly unto King Arthur. Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained
for you, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to
you and your queen. And then anon that damosel picked her away privily,
that no man wist where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and
wroth, and asked from whence came that damosel. There was not one that
knew her nor wist where she was become. Then Queen Guenever called to
her Sir Ector de Maris, and there she made her complaint to him, and
said: I wot well this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me
and of Sir Launcelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be
destroyed. And ever the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so
marvellous deeds of arms that he wondered sore what knight he might be,
and well he wist it was not Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir
Tristram was in Petit Britain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he
deemed, an he had been in the realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of
his fellows that were in the quest of Sir Tristram that they should
have found him or that time. So King Arthur had marvel what knight he
might be. And ever Sir Arthur’s eye was on that shield. All that espied
the queen, and that made her sore afeard.

Then ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon
the right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might
withstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to
withdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight
with the strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him
Sir Uwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him arm him and make him ready.
So anon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram,
and required him to tell them where he had that shield. Sir, he said, I
had it of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King Arthur.

 So here endeth this history of this book, for it is the first book of
 Sir Tristram de Liones and the second book of Sir Tristram followeth.
