Transcriber's Note:

This book was originally typeset using three different font sizes:
largest for the main body of the text, smaller for the text of the
tales, and smallest for the square bracketed author notes. As font
size cannot be varied in this version of the e-text, the effect has
been reproduced here using indentation: no indentation for the main
body of the text, small indentation for the tales, and larger
indentation for the square bracketed author notes.

The frontispiece illustration has been moved to follow the title page.

There are a few Greek words in this text. They have been transliterated
in this version, and are surrounded with + signs, +like this+.

The footnotes relating to vampires (pp. 323-4) reference modern Greek.
In these cases only, +beta+ has been transliterated as a v rather than
a b.

There are a small number of non-Latin1 characters in this book, which
have been treated as follows: oe ligatures have not been retained; a
with macron (straight line) above it has been rendered as [=a]; e with
breve (u-shaped symbol) above has been rendered as [)e].

There were a very large number of typographic errors in the source
edition of this text. Minor punctuation errors (omitted or incorrect
punctuation, mismatched quote marks etc.) have been amended without
note. Regularly used abbreviations (for example, "Grimm, KM." or
"P.V.S.") have been made consistent throughout, without note. Use of
accents have been made consistent throughout without note. Hyphenation
has been made consistent throughout, without note.

The author uses some alternative spellings--for example, "arn't"
rather than "aren't", "dulness" rather than "dullness", both "shan't"
and "sha'n't"--which have been left unchanged. There are also some
unusual grammatical structures in places, which probably result from
the author's intention to render the translations as literally as
possible. These have also been left unchanged.

The remaining amendments are listed below. All were checked against a
later edition of the book that had been retypeset, and references to
other works were additionally checked against online library
catalogues. In the case of proper names, the amendments were based on
other available occurrences of the name in the text.
