story of "Pervonto" (Basile's "Pentamerone," No. 3) who obtains his
magic power from three youths whom he screens from the sun as they lie
asleep one hot day, and who turn out to be sons of a fairy. Afanasief
compares the story also with the German tale of "The Little Grey
Mannikin," in the "Zeitschrift fuer Deutsche Mythologie," &c., i. pp.
38-40. The incident of wishes being fulfilled by a fish occurs in many
stories, as in that of "The Fisherman," in the "Arabian Nights," "The
Fisherman and his Wife," in Grimm (_KM._, No. 19). A number of stories
about the Pike are referred to by A. de Gubernatis ("Zoolog.
Mythology," ii. 337-9).

[359] The rural police. _Sotnick_ = centurion, from _sto_ = 100.
_Desyatnik_ is a word of the same kind from _desyat_ = 10.

[360] A Ponomar is a kind of sacristan.

[367] The Russian _skovoroda_ is a sort of stew-pan, of great size,
without a handle.

[369] For an account of this mythological bird, see the note on next
page. Ornithologically, the _Zhar-ptitsa_ is the Cassowary.

[371] _Zhar_ = glowing heat, as of a furnace; _zhar-ptitsa_ = the
glow-bird. Its name among the Czekhs and Slovaks is _Ptak Ohnivak_.
The heathens Slavonians are said to have worshipped Ogon or Agon,
Fire, the counterpart of the Vedic Agni. _Agon_ is still the ordinary
Russian word for fire, the equivalent of the Latin _ignis_.

[376] The _kholodnaya izba_--the "cold izba," as opposed to the "warm
izba" or living room.

[377] The etymology of the word _koldun_ is still, I believe, a moot
point. The discovery of the money in the warlock's coffin seems an
improbable incident. In the original version of the story the wizard
may, perhaps, have turned into a heap of gold (see above, p. 231, on
"Gold-men").
