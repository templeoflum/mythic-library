The obscurity of the Celtic tale forms a striking contrast to the
lucidity of the Slavonic. The Russian peasant likes a clear statement
of facts; the Highlander seems, like Coleridge's Scotch admirer, to
find a pleasure in seeing "an idea looming out of the mist."

[297] As well as in all the mythologies. For the magic draught of the
fairy-story appears to be closely connected with the Greek _ambrosia_,
the Vedic _soma_ or _amrita_, the Zend _haoma_.

[298] A water, "Das Wasser des Lebens," in two German stories (Grimm,
Nos. 92 and 97, and iii. p. 178), and in many Greek tales (Hahn, Nos.
32, 37, &c.). An oil or ointment in the Norse tale (Asbjoernsen and
Moe, No. 35, Dasent, No. 3). A balsam in Gaelic tales, in which a
"Vessel of Balsam" often occurs. According to Mr. Campbell ("West
Highland Tales," i. p. 218), "Ballan Iocshlaint, teat, of ichor, of
health, seems to be the meaning of the words." The juice squeezed from
the leaves of a tree in a modern Indian tale ("Old Deccan Days," p.
139).

[299] The mythical bird Garuda, the Indian original of the Roc of the
Arabian Nights, was similarly connected with the Amrita. See the story
of Garuda and the Nagas in Brockhaus's translation of the
"Kathasaritsagara," ii. pp. 98-105. On the Vedic falcon which brings
the Soma down to earth, see Kuhn's "Herabkunft des Feuers," pp.
138-142.

collected from the most distant parts of the world, about grinding
mountains and crashing cliffs, &c., see Tylor's "Primitive Culture,"
pp. 313-16. After quoting three mythic descriptions found among the
Karens, the Algonquins, and the Aztecs, Mr. Tylor remarks, "On the
suggestion of this group of solar conceptions and that of Maui's
death, we may perhaps explain as derived from a broken-down fancy of
solar-myth, that famous episode of Greek legend, where the good ship
Argo passed between the Symplegades, those two huge cliffs that opened
and closed again with swift and violent collision."

Several of the Modern Greek stories are very like the skazka mentioned
above. In one of these (Hahn, ii. p. 234), a Lamia guards the water of
life (+abanato nero+) which flows within a rock; in another (ii. p.
280) a mountain opens at midday, and several springs are disclosed,
each of which cries "Draw from me!" but the only one which is
life-giving is that to which a bee flies.

[312] See above, p. 233.

[313] _Silnaya voda_ or potent water, and _bezsilnaya voda_, or
impotent water (_sila_ = strength).

[314] _Palitsa_ = a cudgel, etc. In the variant of the story quoted in
the preceding section the prince seized Vikhor by the right little
finger, _mizinets_. _Palets_ meant a finger. The similarity of the two
words may have led to a confusion of ideas.

[317] Being as destructive as the poison which was created during the
churning of the Amrita.

[319] In the original he is generally designated as _Katoma--dyad'ka,
dubovaya shapka_, "Katoma-governor, oaken-hat." Not being able to
preserve the assonance, I have dropped the greater part of his title.

[320] _Bogodanny_ (_bog_ = God; _dat'_, _davat'_ = to give). One of
the Russian equivalents for our hideous "father-in-law" is "god-given
father" (_bogodanny otets_), and for "mother-in-law," _bogodanny mat'_
or "God-given mother." (Dahl.)

[321] Four lines are omitted here. See A. de Gubernatis, "Zool.
Mythology," i. 181, where a solar explanation of the whole story will
be found.

[322] These ejaculations belong to the story-teller.

[323] Literally, "Seemed to her as small as a lamb."

[324] _Kolodez_, a word connected with _koloda_ a log, trough, &c.

[325] Afanasief, viii. No. 23 _a_.

[326] To this episode a striking parallel is offered by that of
Gunther's wedding night in the "Nibelungenlied," in which Brynhild
flings her husband Gunther across the room, kneels on his chest, and
finally binds him hand and foot, and suspends him from a nail till
daybreak. The next night Siegfried takes his place, and wrestles with
the mighty maiden. After a long struggle he flings her on the floor
and forces her to submit. Then he leaves the room and Gunther returns.
A summary of the story will be found in the "Tales of the Teutonic
Lands," by G. W. Cox and E. H. Jones, pp. 94-5.

[330] _Prashchurui._

[331] The sentence in italics is a good specimen of the _priskazka_,
or preface.

[332] _Gramota_ = +grammata+ whence comes _gramotey_, able to read and
write = +grammatikos+.

[333] Vanya and Vanyusha are diminutives of Ivan (John), answering to
our Johnny; Vanka is another, more like our Jack.

[334] Literally "with a Solovei-like whistle." The word _solovei_
generally means a nightingale, but it was also the name of a mythical
hero, a robber whose voice or whistle had the power of killing those
who heard it.

[335] _Chmoknuel_, smacked.

[352] _Nijnie_, lower. Thus Nijny Novgorod is the lower (down the
Volga) Novgorod. (Dahl.)

[353] _Kukova_, a stick or cudgel, one end of which is bent and
rounded like a ball.

[354] _Tak de ego ne vzat'._

[355] There are numerous variants of this story among the Skazkas. In
one of these (Afanasief, vii. No. 31) the man on whom the pike has
bestowed supernatural power uses it to turn a Maiden princess into a
mother. This renders the story wholly in accordance with (1) the
Modern Greek tale of "The Half Man," (Hahn, No. 8) in which the magic
formula runs, "according to the first word of God and the second of
the fish shall such and such a thing be done!" (2) The Neapolitan
