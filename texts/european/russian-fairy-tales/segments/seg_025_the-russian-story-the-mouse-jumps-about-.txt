the Russian story the mouse jumps about on the strings
      of a lute in order to deceive the witch, so in the
      Greek it plays a fiddle. But the Greek hero does not
      leave his sister's abode. After remaining concealed
      one night, he again accosts her. She attempts to eat
      him, but he kills her.

      In a variant from Epirus (Hahn, ii. p. 283-4) the
      cannibal princess is called a Chursusissa. Her brother
      climbs a tree, the stem of which she gnaws almost
      asunder. But before it falls, a Lamia comes to his aid
      and kills his sister.

      Afanasief (viii. p. 527) identifies the Sun's Sister
      with the Dawn. The following explanation of the skazka
      (with the exception of the words within brackets) is
      given by A. de Gubernatis ("Zool. Myth." i. 183).
      "Ivan is the Sun, the aurora [or dawn] is his [true]
      sister; at morning, near the abode of the aurora, that
      is, in the east, the shades of night [his witch, or
      false sister] go underground, and the Sun arises to
      the heavens; this is the mythical pair of scales. Thus
      in the Christian belief, St. Michael weighs human
      souls; those who weigh much sink down into hell, and
      those who are light arise to the heavenly paradise."]

As an illustration of this story, Afanasief (_P.V.S._ iii. 272) quotes
a Little-Russian Skazka in which a man, who is seeking "the Isle in
which there is no death," meets with various personages like those
with whom the Prince at first wished to stay on his journey, and at
last takes up his abode with the moon. Death comes in search of him,
after a hundred years or so have elapsed, and engages in a struggle
with the Moon, the result of which is that the man is caught up into
the sky, and there shines thenceforth "as a star near the moon."

The Sun's Sister is a mythical being who is often mentioned in the
popular poetry of the South-Slavonians. A Servian song represents a
beautiful maiden, with "arms of silver up to the elbows," sitting on a
silver throne which floats on water. A suitor comes to woo her. She
waxes wroth and cries,

    Whom wishes he to woo?
    The sister of the Sun,
    The cousin of the Moon,
    The adopted-sister of the Dawn.

Then she flings down three golden apples, which the
"marriage-proposers" attempt to catch, but "three lightnings flash
from the sky" and kill the suitor and his friends.

In another Servian song a girl cries to the Sun--

    O brilliant Sun! I am fairer than thou,
    Than thy brother, the bright Moon,
    Than thy sister, the moving star [Venus?].

In South-Slavonian poetry the sun often figures as a radiant youth.
But among the Northern Slavonians, as well as the Lithuanians, the sun
was regarded as a female being, the bride of the moon. "Thou askest me
of what race, of what family I am," says the fair maiden of a song
preserved in the Tambof Government--

    My mother is--the beauteous Sun,
    And my father--the bright Moon;
    My brothers are--the many Stars,
    And my sisters--the white Dawns.[223]

A far more detailed account might be given of the Witch and her near
relation the Baba Yaga, as well as of those masculine embodiments of
that spirit of evil which is personified in them, the Snake, Koshchei,
and other similar beings. But the stories which have been quoted will
suffice to give at least a general idea of their moral and physical
attributes. We will now turn from their forms, so constantly
introduced into the skazka-drama, to some of the supernatural figures
which are not so often brought upon the stage--to those mythical
beings of whom (numerous as may be the traditions about them) the
regular "story" does not so often speak, to such personifications of
abstract ideas as are less frequently employed to set its conventional
machinery in motion.

[72] "Songs of the Russian People," pp. 160-185.

[73] In one story (Khudyakof, No. 117) there are snakes with
twenty-eight and twenty-nine heads, but this is unusual.

[74] Afanasief, ii. No. 30. From the Chernigof Government. The accent
falls on the second syllable of Ivan, on the first of Popyalof.

[75] _Popyal_, provincial word for _pepel_ = ashes, cinders, whence
the surname Popyalof. A pood is about 40lbs.

[76] On slender supports.

[77] _Pod mostom_, _i.e._, says Afanasief (vol. v. p. 243), under the
raised flooring which, in an _izba_, serves as a sleeping place.

[78] _Zatvelyef_, apparently a provincial word.

[79] The Russian word _krof_ also signifies blood.

[80] The last sentence of the story forms one of the conventional and
meaningless "tags" frequently attached to the skazkas. In future I
shall omit them. Kuzma and Demian (SS. Cosmas and Damian) figure in
Russian folk-lore as saintly and supernatural smiths, frequently at
war with snakes, which they maltreat in various ways. See A. de
Gubernatis, "Zoological Mythology," vol. ii. p. 397.

[81] Afanasief, Skazki, vol. vii. p. 3.

[82] _Chudo_ = prodigy. _Yudo_ may be a remembrance of Judas, or it
may be used merely for the sake of the rhyme.

[83] In an Indian story ("Kathasaritsagara," book vii. chap. 42),
Indrasena comes to a place in which sits a Rakshasa on a throne
between two fair ladies. He attacks the demon with a magic sword, and
soon cuts off his head. But the head always grows again, until at last
the younger of the ladies gives him a sign to split in half the head
he has just chopped off. Thereupon the demon dies, and the two ladies
greet the conqueror rapturously. The younger is the demon's sister,
the elder is a king's daughter whom the demon has carried off from her
home, after eating her father and all his followers. See Professor
Brockhaus's summary in the "Berichte der phil. hist. Classe der K.
Saechs. Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften," 1861. pp. 241-2.

[84] Khudyakof, No. 46.

[85] Afanasief, vol. i. No. 6. From the Chernigof Government. The
_Norka-Zvyer'_ (Norka-Beast) of this story is a fabulous creature, but
zoologically the name of Norka (from _nora_ = a hole) belongs to the
Otter.

[86] Literally "into _that_ world" as opposed to this in which we
live.

[87] This address is a formula, of frequent occurrence under similar
circumstances.

[88] Literally "seated the maidens and pulled the rope."

[89] Some sort of safe or bin.

[94] Quoted from the "Nitimanjari," by Wilson, in his translation of
the "Rig-Veda-Sanhita," vol. i. p. 142.

[95] See also Juelg's "Kalmukische Maerchen," p. 19, where Massang, the
Calmuck Minotaur, is abandoned in the pit by his companions.

[96] Khudyakof, No. 42.

[97] Erlenvein, No. 41. A king's horses disappear. His youngest son
keeps watch and discovers that the thief is a white wolf. It escapes
into a hole. He kills his horse at its own request and makes from its
hide a rope by which he is lowered into the hole, etc.

[98] Afanasief, v. 54.

[99] The word _koshchei_, says Afanasief, may fairly be derived from
_kost'_, a bone, for changes between _st_ and _shch_ are not
uncommon--as in the cases of _pustoi_, waste, _pushcha_, a wild wood,
or of _gustoi_, thick, _gushcha_, sediment, etc. The verb
_okostenyet'_, to grow numb, describes the state into which a skazka
represents the realm of the "Sleeping Beauty," as being thrown by
Koshchei. Buslaef remarks in his "Influence of Christianity on
Slavonic Language," p. 103, that one of the Gothic words used by
Ulfilas to express the Greek +daimonion+ is _skohsl_, which "is purely
Slavonic, being preserved in the Czekh _kauzlo_, sorcery; in the
Lower-Lusatian-Wendish, _kostlar_ means a sorcerer. (But see Grimm's
"Deutsche Mythologie," pp. 454-5, where _skohsl_ is supposed to mean a
forest-sprite, also p. 954.) _Kost'_ changes into _koshch_ whence our
Koshchei." There is also a provincial word, _kostit'_, meaning to
revile or scold.

[100] _Bezsmertny_ (_bez_ = without, _smert'_ = death).

[101] Afanasief, viii. No. 8. _Morevna_ means daughter of _More_, (the
Sea or any great water).

[102] _Grom._ It is the thunder, rather than the lightning, which the
Russian peasants look upon as the destructive agent in a storm. They
let the flash pass unheeded, but they take the precaution of crossing
themselves when the roar follows.

[103] _Zamorskaya_, from the other side of the water, strange,
splendid.

[104] In Afanasief, iv. No. 39, a father marries his three daughters to
the Sun, the Moon, and the Raven. In Hahn, No. 25, a younger brother
gives his sisters in marriage to a Lion, a Tiger, and an Eagle, after
his elder brothers have refused to do so. By their aid he recovers his
lost bride. In Schott, No. 1 and Vuk Karajich, No. 5, the three sisters
are carried off by Dragons, which their subsequently-born brother
kills. (See also Basile, No. 33, referred to by Hahn, and Valjavec, p.
1, Stier, No. 13, and Bozena Nemcova, pp. 414-432, and a German story
in Musaeus, all referred to by Afanasief, viii. p. 662.)

[105] See Chap. IV.

[106] "Being by the advice of her father Haereeth given in marriage to
Offa, she left off her violent practices; and accordingly she appears
in Hygelac's court, exercising the peaceful duties of a princess. Now
this whole representation can hardly be other than the modern,
altered, and Christian one of a Waelcyrie or Swan-Maiden; and almost in
the same words the Nibelungen Lied relates of Brynhild, the flashing
shield-may of the Edda, that with her virginity she lost her mighty
strength and warlike habits."--Kemble's Beowulf, p. xxxv.

[113] A conventional expression of contempt which frequently occurs in
the Skazkas.

[114] _Do chugunnova kamnya_, to an iron stone.

[115] "_Russkaya kost'._" I have translated literally, but the words
mean nothing more than "a man," "something human." Cf. Radloff, iii.
III. 301.

[116] _Bog prostit_ = God will forgive. This sounds to the English ear
like an ungracious reply, but it is the phrase ordinarily used by a
superior when an inferior asks his pardon. Before taking the sacrament
at Easter, the servants in a Russian household ask their employers to
forgive them for any faults of which they may have been guilty. "God
will forgive," is the proper reply.

[117] Khudyakof, No. 43.

[118] _Vikhor'_ (_vit'_ = to whirl), an agent often introduced for the
purpose of abduction. The sorcerers of the present day are supposed to
be able to direct whirlwinds, and a not uncommon form of imprecation
in some parts of Russia is "May the whirlwind carry thee off!" See
Afanasief, _P.V.S._ i. 317, and "Songs of the Russian People," p. 382.

an _Ajdaya_, a word meaning a dragon or snake. It is rendered by
_Drache_ in the German translation of his collection of tales made by
his daughter, but the word is evidently akin to the Sanskrit _ahi_,
the Greek +echir echidna+, the Latin _anguis_, the Russian _ujak_, the
Luthanian _angis_, etc. The Servian word _snaga_ answers to the
Russian _sila_, strength.

other versions of the story of the Giant's heart, or Koshchei's death,
see Professor R. Koehler's remarks on the subject in "Orient und

myth is offered by the Hottentot story in which the heart of a girl

placed in a calabash filled with milk. "The calabash increased in
size, and in proportion to this, the girl grew again inside it."

[145] _Opokhmyelit'sya_, which may be rendered, "in order to drink off
the effects of the debauch."

[146] The Russian bath somewhat resembles the Turkish. The word here
translated "to scrub," properly means to rub and flog with the soft
twig used in the baths for that purpose. At the end of the ceremonies
attended on a Russian peasant wedding, the young couple always go to
the bath.

[147] A sort of pudding or jelly.

[148] Afanasief, v. No. 28. In the preceding story, No. 27, the king
makes no promise. He hides his children in (or upon) a pillar, hoping
to conceal them from a devouring bear, whose fur is of iron. The bear
finds them and carries them off. A horse and some geese vainly attempt
their rescue; a bull-calf succeeds, as in the former case. In another
variant the enemy is an iron wolf. A king had promised his children a
wolf. Unable to find a live one, he had one made of iron and gave it
to his children. After a time it came to life and began destroying all
it found, etc. An interesting explanation of the stories of this class
in which they are treated as nature-myths, is given by A. de
Gubernatis in his "Zoological Mythology," chap. i. sect. 4.

[149] Khudyakof, No. 17.

[150] It has already been observed that the word _chudo_, which now
means a marvel or prodigy, formerly meant a giant.

identical with our own adaptation of +eidolou+.

means a Jew, but is used here for a devil.

[159] Upham's "Sacred and Historical Books of Ceylon," iii. 287.

[160] Afanasief says (_P.V.S._ iii. 588), "As regards the word _yaga_
(_yega_, Polish _jedza_, _jadza_, _jedzi-baba_, Slovak, _jenzi_,
_jenzi_, _jezi-baba_, Bohemian, _jezinka_, Galician _yazya_) it
answers to the Sanskrit _ahi_ = snake."

Shchepkin (in his work on "Russian Fable-lore," p. 109) says: "_Yaga_,
instead of _yagaya_, means properly noisy, scolding, and must be
connected with the root _yagat'_ = to brawl, to scold, still preserved
in Siberia. The accuracy of this etymology is confirmed by the use, in
the speech of the common people, of the designation _Yaga Baba_ for a
quarrelsome, scolding old woman."

Kastorsky, in his "Slavonic Mythology," p. 138, starts a theory of his
own. "The name _Yaga Baba_, I take to be _yakaya baba_, _nycyakaya
baba_, and I render it by _anus quaedam_." Bulgarin (Rossiya, ii. 322)
refers the name to a Finnish root. According to him, "_Jagga-lema_, in
Esthonian, means to quarrel or brawl, _jagga-lemine_ means quarrelling
or brawling." There is some similarity between the Russian form of the
word, and the Singalese name for a (male) demon, _yaka_, which is
derived from the Pali _yakkho_, as is the synonymous term _yakseya_
from the Sanskrit _yaksha_ (see the valuable paper on Demonology in
Ceylon by Dandris de Silva Gooneratne Modliar in the "Journal of the
Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society," 1865-6). Some Slavonic
philologists derive _yaga_ from a root meaning to eat (in Russian
_yest'_). This corresponds with the derivation of the word _yaksha_
contained in the following legend: "The Vishnu Pur[=a]na, i. 5,
narrates that they (the Yakshas) were produced by Brahm[=a] as beings
emaciate with hunger, of hideous aspect, and with long beards, and
that, crying out 'Let us eat,' they were denominated Yakshas (fr.
_jaksh_, to eat)." Monier Williams's "Sanskrit Dictionary," p. 801. In
character the Yaga often resembles a Rakshasi.

an epitome of the remainder within brackets and in small type.

[194] From the Poltava Government. Afanasief, vi. No. 28 _b_.

[195] Grimm, No. 65. The Wallachian and Lithuanian forms resemble the
German (Schott, No. 3. Schleicher, No. 7). In all of them, the heroine
is a princess, who runs away from an unnatural father. In one of the
Modern Greek versions (Hahn, No. 27), she sinks into the earth. For
references to seven other forms of the story, see Grimm, _KM._, iii.
p. 116. In one Russian variant (Khudyakof, No. 54), she hides in a
secret drawer, constructed for the purpose in a bedstead; in another
(Afanasief, vi. No. 28 _a_), her father, not recognising her in the
pig-skin dress, spits at her, and turns her out of the house. In a
third, which is of a very repulsive character (ibid. vii. No. 29), the
father kills his daughter.

[196] Afanasief, vi. No. 18.

[197] The Russian word is _zakukovali_, _i.e._, "They began to
cuckoo." The resemblance between the word _kukla_, a puppet, and the
name and cry of the cuckoo (_Kukushka_) may be merely accidental, but
that bird has a marked mythological character. See the account of the
rite called "the Christening of the Cuckoos," in "Songs of the Russian
people," p. 215.

[198] Very like these puppets are the images which reply for the
sleeping prince in the opening scene of "De beiden Kuenigeskinner"
(Grimm, No. 113). A doll plays an important part in one of
Straparola's stories (Night v. Fable 2). Professor de Gubernatis
identifies the Russian puppet with "the moon, the Vedic Raka, very
small, but very intelligent, enclosed in the wooden dress, in the
forest of night," "Zoological Mythology," i. 207-8.

[203] The germ of all these repulsive stories about incestuous unions,
proposed but not carried out, was probably a nature myth akin to that
alluded to in the passage of the Rigveda containing the dialogue
between Yama and Yami--"where she (the night) implores her brother
(the day) to make her his wife, and where he declines her offer
because, as he says, 'they have called it sin that a brother should
marry his sister.'" Max Mueller, "Lectures," sixth edition, ii. 557.

[205] Her name _Vyed'ma_ comes from a Slavonic root _ved_, answering
to the Sanskrit _vid_--from which springs an immense family of words
having reference to knowledge. _Vyed'ma_ and _witch_ are in fact
cousins who, though very distantly related, closely resemble each
other both in appearance and in character.

[215] The demonism of Ceylon "represents demons as having _human_
fathers and mothers, and as being born in the ordinary course of
nature. Though born of human parents, all their qualities are
different from those of men. They leave their parents sometime after
their birth, but before doing so, they generally take care to try
their demoniac powers on them." "Demonology and Witchcraft in Ceylon,"

Royal Asiatic Society," 1865-6, p. 17.

Serpent Child," (Hahn, No. 100), the heroine, the wife of the man whom

They are called "Sisters of the Sun."
