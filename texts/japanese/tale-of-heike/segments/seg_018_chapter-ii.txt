CHAPTER II.
IKKO AJARI.

    Now the priests brought their ex -Zasshu to Myo -ko-in which is in the southern valley of the
To to or eastern pagoda. Perchance even a Gonge (manifestation of Buddha) cannot avoid a
chanc e misfortune like his.

Of old time in China, Ikko Ajari, Court Chaplain to the Emperor Genso of the To dynasty, was
raised to favour and confidence by the Empress Yo -ki-hi, and as both then and now in great and
small countries people will babble, he fell under suspicion, and even though it was groundless he
was exiled to the land of Kara. To this land there were three roads ; that called Rinchi -do, the
Imperial Road, that called Yuchi -do by which the common people travelled, and that called
Anketsu -do (dar k cave way) by which criminals travelled; so this Ikko Ajari, having committed a
great crime, had to go by the Anketsu -do, and for seven days and nights without seeing the sun or
moon he travelled on it. As it was thus dark and there was no inhabitant, he lost his way,
wandering on the shore of a lake and going through a deeply wooded mountain, while only the
voice of a bird was heard in a watery ravine. While he was weeping there so that his garments
were wet as moss, a god took pity on him, exiled without  cause, and delivered him by showing
nine luminaries in the sky. Then Ikko, biting a finger of his left hand, drew the nine luminaries on
his left sleeve with the

blood. So it is that in both China and Japan the [11]mandara of nine luminaries is the chief object
of worship of the Shingon -shu.
