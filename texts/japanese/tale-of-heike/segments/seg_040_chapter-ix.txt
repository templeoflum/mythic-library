houses were overturned; the wind star ted from Naka -no-Mikado Kyogoku and blew across to the
south -west, tearing the roofs off the gate -houses of the mansions and carrying them away to a
distance of from four or five to ten cho. Rafters and beams and pillars flew about in the air, and
the wood en shingles from the roofs blew about everywhere like leaves in the wind. The mighty

Throne and the Law of Buddha will decline: wars will also follow one on another:" So the Official
Soothsayers and Court Diviners both decid ed unanimously.
