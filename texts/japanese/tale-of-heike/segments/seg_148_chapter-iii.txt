CHAPTER III.
THE IMPERIAL EDICT TO YASHIMA.

     After a few days the Imperial Messenger Hanakata, Groom of the Imperial Bedchamber,
arrived at the shore of Yashima in Sanuki on the twenty eighth day of the same month, and
presented the Edict of the Hō -ō. The Daijin Munemori and all the Heike Courtiers met in
solemn assembly to hear it, and it was opened and read thus:

     " That the August Person of the Divine Sovereign should leave the Ninefold Precincts of the
Palace and journey through the provinces, and that the Three Sacred Treasures should be hi dden
in Shikoku for so many years, is a great calamity to the Imperial Court; and may be the cause of
our country's ruin. Now this Shigehira -no-Kyō is the disloyal subject who burnt the Tōdaiji at
Nara, and according to the advice of Our Minister Yoritomo whom we have consulted should
properly be put to death. Separated from those of his family he was captured alive, and now
languishes in captivity like a caged bird that pines for the sky, or, like a wild goose that has lost
his mates, he would fly back to the far -away isle in the southern seas where is the Palace of his
Imperial Lord. But if the Three Sacred Treasures be returned to the Capital forthwith, this rebel
lord shall receive our Imperial Forgiveness. This is Our Imperial Edict. Given on the fourte enth
day of the second day of the third year of Ju -ei by the hand of Daizen -no-Taiyū Naritada. To the
former Taira Dainagon.
