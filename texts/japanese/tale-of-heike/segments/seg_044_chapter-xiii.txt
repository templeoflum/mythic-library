CHAPTER XIII.

A DONATION.


Now Shigemori wished to do many virtuous actions  in this life and to have prayers said for his
benefit in the world to come, but in Japan, however great merit a man may achieve, it is doubtful
whether he will have a succession of descendants to pray for him in the future. He thought
therefore that he wo uld acquire merit in another country to ensure prayers being said for him
after death. So in the spring of Angen he summoned a certain ship captain from Kyushu named
Myoden and received him in private audience, giving him the following commands: "You are a
man of proved honesty; here are three thousand ryo of gold, and of these I present you with five
hundred : do you proceed to the Court of Sung and give a thousand ryo to the priests of Ikuozan
[43], and the remaining two thousand to the Emperor of Sung, that estates may be bought and
presented to Ikuozan, and they may say prayers for Shigemori in the life to come."

Myoken, taking charge of the gold, and braving the angry sea for coun tless miles, at last arrived in
the Sung country and met Bussho Zenji Toku -ko, the prior of Ikuozan, to whom he related all his
business. The priest, rejoicing greatly, received

the thousand ryo and handed it over to the priests of Ikuozan, whi le he presented another two
thousand to the Emperor. When he reported to the Emperor the words of Komatsu Dono, His
Majesty was struck with admiration, and ordered five hundred cho of land to be presented to
Ikuozan, and it is said that an inscription pray ing for a happy rebirth in the future existence for
the Minister of Japan, Taira -no-Ason Shigemori Ko, is still in existence at that place at the
present day. After the death of Komatsu Dono, the Nyudo fell into a state of melancholy, and
hastening to Fuku hara, went into retirement there.
