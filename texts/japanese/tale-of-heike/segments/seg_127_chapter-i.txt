CHAPTER I.

p.111

     On the first day of the New Year of the third year of Ju ei the customary reception of the
Retired Emperor and Audience of the Emperor were not held, for the mansion of Daizen -no-aiyū
Naritada, which the Hō -ō was using as his temporary Palace, was not considered suitable. The
Heike also welcomed the New Year by the shore of Yashima in Sanuki, but though the Emperor
was present, the Festival of the Setchie was not held, nor the Imperial Worship of Heaven and
Earth. No envoys brought the tribute of fish from Tsukushi, nor did the time honoured
messengers arrive from Yoshino. All the Courtiers lamented the disorder of the times, declaring
that in the Capital, however, things could not be so bad. Spring had now come, and though the
sea breezes blew softly and the sunshine was warm and genial, the Heike Nobles still shivered
like tropical birds amid the ice. Thus they spe nt the long drawn tedious hours in talk and
reminiscence of their pleasant life in Miyako; of the times of the blossoming and fading of the
various trees and flowers, of the cherry blooms and the moonlight nights, of their verses and
music and games of foo t ball and archery, the competitions of painting and writing stanzes on fans,
and all their elegant diversions with insects and grasses; and as they lingered over the recollections
of all these lost delights their hearts were filled with sadness.
