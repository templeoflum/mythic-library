CHAPTER XII.

OF LANTERNS.


Now Shigemori was a minister who had a strong desire to destroy  evil and encourage virtue, and
therefore, deploring the coming doom of his house, in imitation of the forty -eight vows of Amida,
he built forty -eight temples at the foot of Higashi -yama, and hung up forty -eight lanterns, one in
each of them. On the fourte enth and fifteenth of every month they were lighted and prayers
were offered, so that they looked like the brilliant effulgence of the polished mirrors that shine in
the beauteous palaces of the Paradise of the Pure Land. Moreover two hundred and eighty -eight
young and lovely maidens of noble birth were selected, six for each temple, and these were
ordained as nuns, that on these two days of every month they might raise their voices in earnest
and unceasing supplication. In truth it seemed as if the light o f the Nyorai who comes to receive
men shone on the earth, as if the rays of the All -Saving Buddha shone on the minister. On the
fifteenth day there was a great

supplication, and the minister himself walked in the midst of the procession. Turning to the west
and joining his hands together he played thus: "Hail Amida Nyorai, Thou who guidest and leadest
us to the Paradise of the West, save, we beseech thee, all men of the Three Worlds and Six
Ways." When the people saw him thus going round and prayi ng, their hearts were greatly
touched, and those who heard of it shed tears of gratitude. Therefore Shigemori became known
by the name of 'Toro -daijin' or 'Lantern Minister.'
