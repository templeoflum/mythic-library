CHAPTER XVIII.

THE SEINAN DETACHED PALACE.

In a hundred volumes we find the saying: "Filial piety is the most important thing. A wise
monarch governs the Empire by filial piety." Therefore we see that Tokyo revered his old and
feeble mother and Gushun respected his obstinate father. It is very blessed when the Imperial
Will follows the example of such wise and pious rulers. About this time the Emperor secre tly
sent this message to the Ho -o at the Tosa Palace : "In such an age even though one live in the
Palace what can one do? Perhaps it is best to retire into the mountains and become a recluse as
was done by Uda Tenno in the era of Kwampei and by Kwazan Ten no in former times." To this
the Ho -o replied " Do not think of such a thing. If you remain as you are, it is one source of
reliance for me, but if you depart from the Palace, on what can I rely? At any rate wait and see
what my fate will be." The Emperor,  on receiving this letter, pressed it to his face and wept
unrestrainedly.
As the sages have said: "The Emperor is the ship [48]; the subjects are the water. The water may
make the shi p float well, or again the water may overturn the ship. The subjects may protect the
Emperor, or again the subjects may overthrow the
[p. 159]
Emperor." In Hogen and Heiji the Lay -priest Chancellor protected the Emperor, but now in
Angen and Jisho he sets him at naught just as the classic says.
The Grand Chancellor Omiya [49], the Naidaijin Sanjo [50], the Dainagon Hamuro [51], and the
Chunagon Nakayama [52] were all dead. and Seirai [53] and Shinhan [54] only were left; but these
two, thinking it was no use remaining at Court in such an age, even if they became Dainagon,
retired from the world and became monks while still young. Mimbu -no-Kyo Nyudo Shinhan
having the hoar frosts of Ohara for company, and Saisho Nyudo Seirai living among the mists of
Koya, both had no thought for anything but attaining enlightenment in the next existence . In
ancient days in China too there were man who hid themselves in the clouds of Shozan [55] and
cleansed their hearts under the moon of Eisen [56], so what wonder was it that these deeply
learned and pure minded men should forsake so troublesome a world ?
When the Saisho Nyudo among the recesses of Mt. Koya heard that the Emperor also wished to
retire from the wor ld, he exclaimed: " Ah, well it was that I have so soon become a recluse ; for
though to hear of it while here in seclusion is evil enough, how great a grief would it have been to
have heard it while in attendance on His Majesty. The revolts of Hogen and H eiji were indeed
evil, but now the age has become more degenerate, and such extraordinary things as this have
come to pass. What will happen to the Empire in future no one can tell. Would that I could
ascend above the clouds or hide myself deep in the

[p. 160]
farthest mountains." Verily it could not be considered a world in which anyone with any sense
would live.
On the twenty first day the Tendai Zasshu Kakukwai Ho Shinno realized his oft expressed wish
and retired, the former Zasshu Mei un Dai Sojo being  reinstated in his place. The Lay -priest
Chancellor, though he had thus recklessly overturned and scattered everything, seeing that his
daughter was the Chugu and his soil in law the Kwampaku, now felt quite easy in his mind about
everything, and went off to Fukuhara declaring that the administration was entirely according to
the wishes of the Emperor. On the twenty third day the former Udaisho Munenori -no-Kyo
hastened to the Palace and reported thus to the Emperor ; whereupon His Majesty said : "If I had
received authority from the Ho -o according to custom I might do something, but as things are, do
you take counsel with the Kwampaku and do as you like about the administration:" and he paid
no further attention to the matter.
Now the winter was half over an d the Ho -o was in the Seinan Detached Palace. The wind of
Yazan [57] sounded shrilly, and the moon shone bright on the frozen garden. The snow fell and
piled up on the courtyard, but n o one's footsteps were seen upon it. The ice thickened on the
ponds, but no flocks of birds resorted thither. The boom of the bell of the great temple
resounded in his ears like that of Iaiji [58] in China; the white snow on the western hills reminded
him of the scene of the peak of Koro. In the cold frosty evening the clink of the fuller's mallet
was borne faintly to his pillow; while at dawn he was awakened by the slow wheels creaking  on
the ice outside the gate. The travellers passing along the highway, the sight of the galloping
warhorses, the pomp and movement of this fleeting world, how vain it seems to one who
understands. The guards before the
[p. 161]
Palace gates who kept watch  day and night, by what connexion in a former existence was it that
they were now brought into this relation with him? What an awe inspiring thought it was. Thus
on every side the Ho -o found things that gave him pain. So during his exile here he could not
help occupying his thoughts with the memory of the various excursions and pilgrimages and
festivals he had enjoyed, and the recollection of them would bring tears to his eyes; And so things
went on and the fourth year of Jisho began.

a :harm used when the afterbirth is obstructed. When it is not obstructed  it is not done. The custom came
from the common people and has no authority. The 'koshiki used are brought from the village of Ohara.
In pictures treasured from ancient times one sees the dropping of these rice vessels shown when a birth
has taken place a mong the common people." The charm originates in the assonance of 甗 koshiki, rice
