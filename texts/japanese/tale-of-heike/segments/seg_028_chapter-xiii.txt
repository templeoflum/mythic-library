wisdom of Gekkwai Choja procured from the Palace of the Dragon King, when of old in Shae [32]
in mid -India five kinds of disease broke out and priests and people died in great multitudes. After
Buddhism was destroyed they stayed in India more than five hundred years. Since Buddhism
moved to the eastward they were brought to Kudara, and after a thousand years, Seimei being
Emperor of Kudara and Kemmei Tenno of this land, they were brought thence to Japan and
lodged at Naniwa no ura in the province of Settsu. Since golden rays always shone from them the
name of the era was called Konko (golden ray s).

In the third month of the third year and during the first ten days Honda Yoshimitsu of Omi in
Shinano same up to the capital to meet the statues and took them back with him to his own
place: by day Yoshimitsu carried the statues but by night they carr ied him. Arriving at Shinano he
lodged them in the district of Mizunouchi. Since then five hundred years have gone by but this
was the first time a fire broke out. It is said that if the monarchical principle is destroyed
Buddhism will first be abolished, so that people said that the destruction of this holy mountain
and its many temples was a portent of the coming overthrow of the monarchy.
