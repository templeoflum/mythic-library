The Tale of Genji                                      Murasaki ShikibuGenji Monogatari – The Tale of Genji
Murasaki Shikibu
Genji Monogatari, or The Tale of Genji, is a Japanese classic novel from the eleventh
century. Supposedly commissioned by members of the Imperial Family, it tells the
story of the son of the Emperor's favorite concubine and his role as a privileged boy
and man, but not quite recognized as royal. He is placed in a loveless marriage, but
continues a number of 'friendships' with the women of the court. This translation
brings us the first seventeen chapters, and there is some dispute over the authorship
of later (not included) chapters. The book gives us a fascinating insight into court life
of the period.
