founders ofstates. These are set down here as precedents for the stories
of the founders of the Three Kingdoms, to be found in the following
chapters.
G. Old Chosun(Wanggom Chosnn)
In the Wei-shu'!. it is written, "Two thousand years ago (Traditional
date: 2333 B.C.) Tangun, otherwise called Wanggom, chose Asadal,
also described as Muyop-san in the province of Paekju east of Kae­
so.ng, at a place now called Paegak-kung (1 modern P'yongyang) as his
:royal residence and founded a nation, calling it Chosun, at the same
period as Kao (legendary Chinese Emperor Yao)."
In the Old Book it is written, "In ancient times Hwan-in (Heavenly
King, Chesok or Sakrodeveendra) had a young son whose name was
Hwan-ung. The boy wished to descend from heaven and live in the
human world. His father, after examining three great mountains,
chose T'aebaek-san (the Myohyang Mountains in north Korea) as a
suitable place for his heavenly son to bring happiness to human beings.
He gave Hwan-ung three heavenly treasures, and commanded him to
rule over his people.
"With three thousand of his Joyal sllbjects Hwalll-ung descended
from heaven and appeared under a sandalwood tree on T'ae'baek Moun­
tain. He named the place Sin-si (dty of gpd) and assum:ed the title of
Hwan-ung Ch'6nwang (another .title meaning heavenly till'g)~ He. led
his ministers of wind, rain and clouds in teadlling tlte peo.p·le mote thatfll
360 useful arts, including agriculture and medreine, inculcated moral
principles and imposed a code of law.
"In those days there lived a she-bear and a tigress in the same cave.
They prayed to Sin-ung (another name ofHwan-ung) to be blessed with
incarnation as human beings. The king took pity on them and gave
them each a bunch of mugwort and twenty pieces of garlic, saying,
<Jfyou eat this holy food and do not see the sunlight for one hundred
days, you will become human beings.'
"The she-bear and the tigress took the food and ate it, and retired
-32­Wonder I
it . "~
into the cave .. In twenty-one days the bear, who had faithfully observed
•the king's instructions, became a woman. But the tigress, who had dis­
, obeyed, remained in her original form.
"But the bear-woman could find no husband, so she prayed under
the sandalwood tree to be blessed with a child. Hwan-ung heard her
prayers and married her. She conceived and bore a son who was called
Tangun Wanggom, the King of Sandalwood.
"In the fiftieth year of the reign of Tang Kao (legendary Chinese
· emperor Yao, traditional date some time before 2000 B.C.) in the year
· of Kyong-in (if it was Kyong-in, it must be the 23rd year) Tangun came
•. to P'yongyang (now Sogyong), set up his royal residence there and
bestowed the name Chosun upon his kingdom.
"Later Tangun moved his capital to Asadal on T'aebaek-san and
ruled 15QO years, untit king Wu of Chou (ancient Chinese dynasty)
placed Kija. on 1ihe throne (traditional date 1122 B.C.). When Kija
arrived, Tangun moved to Changtang-kyong and then returned to
:'Asadal, where he beca:me Ir. mQun.taitn god at the age of 1,908."
In the book of P'eichu-chuan of Tang (Chinese dynasty, 618-907
AD.) it is written, "Koryo (i.e. Koguryo) was originally Kojuk-kuk
(now Haeju) and was called Chosun by the Chou emperor on the in­
'vestiture of Kija. During the Han dynasty (Chinese, 206 B.C.-222
'A.D.) Chosun was divided into three counties-Hyonto, Nangnang and
·Taebang." The book Tung-tien gives the same account. However,
'the Han-shu tells of four counties (ChinbOn, Imtun, Hyonto and
;Nangnang) with names different from those in the other sources, for
some unknown reason. (This is an allusion to a portion of northwestern
Korea which was under direct Chinese rule from 108 B.C. to 313 A.D.
The' t'J1l1'yene ofany enduring importance was Nangnang, called Lolang I
in Chinese:)i -.I

chia, so he became king more than 40 years later than Hyokkose (Silla
founder) and Tongmyong (Kogury(S founder). (This statement corres­
ponds fairly well with the traditional foundation dates, which are Silla
57 B.C., Kogury(S 37 B.C. and Paekje 18 B.C.)
The Tang-shu states that the ancestors of Pyonhan lived in the
land of Nangnang because Onjo was descended from Tongmyong.
Perhaps a hero of Nangnang origin established a state in Pyonhan
which was in rivalry with Mahan before the reign of Onjo, but this
does not mean that Onjo himself came from the north of Nangnang.
(The latter statement is purely conjectural)
Some scholars call Mt. Kuryong Mt. Pyonna, but this is a mistake.
According to an authentic statement of an ancient sage there was a
mountain named Pyon-san in the land of Paekje, hence the country
was called Pyonhan. (This is evidently a mistake.)
In her heyday Paekje had a population of 152,300 households.9
15. Cbinban
In the Houhan-shu it is written, "The men of Chin han said, 'When
the refugees from Ch'in (One of the Chinese kingdoms during the War­
ring States period in China, previous to the Han dynasty) arrived in
Korea, Mahan ceded them an area along her esatern frontier, and host
and guest called each other 'to,' meaning fellow-man. The Chinese
pronunciation was 'tu.' This and qther similarities led to the writing of
the name ofChinhan in Chinese fashion, using the name ofthe Chinese
state of Ch'in plus the character designating Korea, Han. Chinhan was
-divided into 12small states,eachconsisting ofabout 10,000 households."
16. Kyoogju (Pleasure Ground for Each of the Four Seasons)
(This section is somewhat out ofplace chronologically but is left in
its original place as it sets the scene for much of what is to follow.)
When Silla reached the height of her prosperity the capital,
Kyongju, consisted of 178,936 houses, 1,360 sections, fifty-fiv~ ~t(~~ts
48­Wonder 1
and thirty-five mansions. There was a villa and pleasure ground for
each of the four seasons, to which the aristocrats resorted. These were
Tongya, the east field house, for spring; Kokyang house, for summer;
Kuchi house, for autumn; and Kai house for winter.
During the reign of the forty-ninth king H(Sngang, houses
with tiled roofs stood in rows in the capital and, not a thatched roof
was to be seen. Gentle sweet rain came with harmonious blessings and
all the harvests were plentiful. r17. King Hyokkose, the Founder of Silla
In ancient times there were six districts in Chinhan, each belonging
to a separate clan. They were the Yi, Chong, Son, Ch'oe, Pae and S(Sl
clans, each of which claimed to have a divine progenitor.
On the first day of the third month ofTi-chieh (during the Chinese
Han dynasty) the chieftains ofthese six clans and their families gathered
on the bank of a stream called Alch'(Sn to discuss problems ofcommon
interest. There was general agreement as follows: "It is not good for
us to live in scattered villages without protection. We are in danger of
attack by strong enemies nearby. We must therefore seek a noble and
glorious king to rule over us and defend us as ourcommander-in-chief."
The chieftains and their families then climbed a high mountain,
where they worshipped and prayed to heaven to send them a gracious
prince according to their wish. Suddenly there was a lightning.flash,
and an auspicious rainbow stretched down from heaven and touched
the earth in the south by the well called Najong in the direction of Mt.
Yang, where a white horse was seen kneeling and bowing to something.
In great wonderment they ran down to the well. When they came
near, the white horse neighed loudly and fl~w up to heaven on the rising
veil of the rainbow, leaving behind a large red egg (some say a blue egg)
lying on a giant rock near the well. When the people cracked the egg
they found within it a baby boy whose noble face shone like the sun.
When he was given a bath in the East Stream (where Tongch'(Sn Temple
stands, to the north) he looked everi more bright and handsome.
-49­

SOlliglik Ylisa
The people danced for joy, and the birds and beasts sang and
danced round the boy. Heaven and earth shook, and the sun and moon'
shone brightly (indicating that this was indeed the king they had prayed
for). They named him King Hye>kke>se, meaning bright ruler. (Ilye>n
goes on to cite similar stories of fabLlous births such as the goddess
mother of the Fairy Peach from Chinese sources, perhaps to authen­
ticate this one. The official records-compiled, of course, long after
the event-list Hye>kkose as the first king of Silla and give his reign
dates as 57 B.C. to 3 A.D.)lo
They offered the wonderful boy the royal title "Ke>siilgam" or
"Kosogan" because when he first spoke he declared "Alji-Kose>gan
(baby-king) is rising." For this reason succeeding Silla sovereigns all
bore the title Kosogan. (King) All the people in the country welcomed
the boy-king with cheerful acclamations and hoped that he would
marry a virtuous queen. .
On the same day a she-dragon descended from heaven to another
well, called Aryongjong in Saryang-ni, and from under her ribs on the
left side produced a baby girl, who burst like a flower from a bud. (Some
accounts say the she-dragon appeared and died, and the baby was found
inside when the body was opened.)
The child was fair offace and graceful ofform, but her mouth was
like the beak of a chick. However, when the people bathed her in the
North Stream of Moon Castle, the beak fell off, revealing her cherry­
red lips. The stream was thenceforth called Palch'on (beak-falling
stream).
The people erected a palace at the foot of South Mountain and
brought up the two babies, who grew to be a noble prince and princess.
Since the prince had been born from an egg in the shape of the gourd
called "pak" in the native tongue, they gave him the family name Pak.
(Evidently a foundation-myth of the Pak clan. The official records do
indeed indicate that the first three Silla kings and some later ones were
ofthis clan. The name is a common one in modern Korea.) The princess
was named Aryong after the well where she was born:
When they reached the age of thirteen in the first year of Wufeng.
-50 ­Wonder I
the prince was crowned king with Princess ArYe>ng as his queen consort.
The country at this time was called Sorabo! or SobOl, a native dialect
word. The name Silla was not used until a later time. during the reign
of Kirim-Nijilgiim (although some historians attribute this namjng
to the reign of Chijong Maripkan or King pophiing.)
(IlyiJn here inserts a brief account of the founding of the Kim clan.
The original Kim-the word means "gold" -was said to hal'e been found
in a/orest where a golden cock crowed. The Kim clan eventually took
over the Silla throne and kept it until the end of tlie kingdom. Kim is
the commonest surname in Korea.)
Thus Hye>kke>se, the Great Chief of the Pak family founded the
kingdom of Silla and ruled over it for sixty-two years, after which he
ascended to heaven. After seven days the ashes of his body fell to the
earth and scattered, and the soul of his queen ascended to join him in
paradise.
All the people wept over the ashes of their good king and queen.
and tried to bury them in the same tomb, but a large snake appeared
and prevented this. So the royal remains of each were divided into five
parts and interred in pairs in the Northern Mausoleum, within the
precincts of a temple called Tamom-sa. The people called these the
Five Mausoleums, or Saniing (Tomb of the Snake). The Crown Prince
succeeded to the throne and was given the title Namhae-wang (second I
Silla king in the official records, reigned 4-24 A.Q.) ---I
18. King Namhae
Namhae Ke>se>gan was also called Ch'ach'a Ung or High Chief,
a unique title honoring this king. His father was King Hye>kkose, his
mother was Lady Arye>ng and his queen was Lady Unje. Now to the
west of Yongil-hyoll rises Mt. Unje, where dwelt the queen's goddess
mother. She sent down ~ain in times 01 Clrought when the people offered
prayers. to her. <
King Namhae ascended the throne in the fourth year of Yuanshih
(Kapcha) during the reign of P'ing-ti of the prior (Chinese) Han

General's Voice: 	I, Your Majesty's humble subject, in life assisted the
throne as a soldier by destroying enemies and en­
hancing the royal power and after death became a
protective .spirit guarding the kingdom against
catastrophe. Nevertheless, in the year of Kyongsul
(771) my guiltless descendant was shamefully put to
death. It is evident that both the present king and his
court have forgotten my patriotic deeds. I would like
to move to another place and cease caring for
these ungrateful creatures. Now I pause for a reply
in the hope that Your Majesty will grant my
request.
King's Voice: 	 If you and I do not guard this couIJ.try with our
immortaL strength, what wiII become of our poor
people? I command you to continue.to display your
patriotic spirit with loyal mind for the welfare of the
state.
Thrice the King's spirit spoke persuasively and thrice the angry
general's ghost grumbled and complained. Then the wind arose once
more and he was gone.
King Hyegong was astonished when he heard of this. He sent the
grand vizier Kim Kyong-sin to the tomb of Kim Yu-sin to apologize
to his spirit. In addition, he donated a tract of royal land to Ch'uson
'Temple so that the income might be used for sacrifices to appease the
general's wrath and pray for the repose of his soul. This temple had
been erected in honor of Kim Yu-sin's triumphant return from
F'yongyang after a great victory over Koguryo.
Had it not been for the persuasion of the virtuous spirilt of King
Mich'u. Kim Yu-sin's anger could nothave been appeased. In this way
the great king protected Silla even after his death. For this reason his
countrymen remembered his august virtue and offered sacrifices to
his spirit with the same piety with which they worshipped the three
sacred mountains. Moreover they elevated his tomb to the highest
rank, even above that of the founder of the kingdom.

~.King Naemul and Pak Che-sang15
(King Naemul reignedfrom 356 to 402, so that his thirty-sixth year
would be 391. Japan at this time was not yet unified and historical data
.(In the period are extremely sketchy. The oldest Japanese records do
mention a Korean who may possibly be identified with M ihae. Which ofthe
Japanese islands Mihae was sent to is not specified, but Kyushu seems
the most likely. Throughout this story [lyon consistently refers to the
Japanese with the contemptuous term wai (dwarfs), probably an indica­
tion of his own attitude rather than that of the people whom he
describes.)
In the thirty-sixth year of King Naemul (391), the seventeenth SilIa
King, a Japanese ruler sent an envoy to Kyongju to pay homage to the
King. The envoy denounced Paekje for her attacks on Silla (there was
more or less constant war among the three kingdoms throughout
their history) and conveyed his lord's request that a prince of Silla be
sent to return the courtesy. (All this amounts to an offer of alliance.)
So King Naemul sent his third son Mihae,16 who was then ten years
old, with an elderly courtier named Pak Sa-ram to take care of him.
But the Japanese ruler did not respect his status as an envoy and
held him hostage. He did not return to his homeland until he was forty
)'ears old.
In the third year of King Nulji (419; King Nulji reigned from 417
to 458), the nineteenth sovereign of Silla, King Changsu of Koguryo
sent an envoy with the request that Pohae (in Samguk Sagi, Pohae is
represented as Pokhae), King Nulji's young,er brother, be sent to his
~ourt for a friendly visit. The King made peate with Koguryo and sent
Pohae to P'yongyang with Kim Mu-al, an old courtier, to attend him.
But King Changsu, like the Japanese ruler, held the young prince
hostage and would not release him ...
(There is some chronological c01ifusion in what follows. Between
King Naemul and King Nu(ji another· sovereign, King Silsong, is recorded
10 hal'e ruled from 402 to 417. A possible explanation is that King
6 1

Samguk Yusa
$ilsiJng was King Naemul's brother rather than his son, since passing 011
the throne to a brother was a common practice in East Asiall
mOl1archi~s. )
In the tenth year of King Nulji, even in the year of Ulch'uk
(426), the King invited his courtiers and military leaders to attend a
court entertainment. Amid the flowing of the wine and the singing and
dancing the King suddenly burst into tears and spoke as follows:
"My father (King Naemul, evidently) sent his beloved son to Japan
and died without the joy of seeing him again. Since I ascended the
throne my strong neighbor (i.e. Koguryo) has warred against me and
attacked our frontier time and again. Believing that the king of Ko­
guryo wanted peace with me, I sent my own younger brother to his.
court. But now he holds my brother hostage and will not let him return.
I am rich and noble, tears flow from my eyes day and night.
If only I could see my two brothers again and we (:ould apologize
before the shrine of my father, I would be most happy. Who can bring
the two princes back to my palace?"
"Your Majesty," the courtiers replieQ, "this is not an easy matter.
None but a wise and brave man can perform such a great mission. We
recommend Pak Che-sang, the magistrate ofSapna county."
Pak Che-sang was accordingly brought before the King and charg­
ed with the mission of returning the two princes. In accepting it he re­
plied. "When the King is grieved his subjects are disgraced. If the King
is in disgrace his subjects must die. If the subjects do only what is easy
and wilI not undertake what is most difficult, they are disloyal, and if
they consider only saving their own lives they are cowards. Though I
am an unworthy subject I will faithfully execute this mission, given
me by royal command."
The King was choked with emotion. He drank with Pak Che-sang
from the same cup and bid him a fond farewell, holding him by the
hand. Pak took leave of the court and immediately journeyed north­
ward in disguise. In Koguryo he gained access to. the place where
Pohae was being held. After explaining his plan of escape and setting
a time and place to meet, he hastened away to the rendezvous on the
-62­Wonder 1
seacoast at Kosong.
In order to disarm suspicion Pohae feigned illness and did not
appear at the king's morning audience for several days. Then on the
appointed evening he fled secretly to Kosong.
When the king of Koguryo was informed of Pohae's flight he
ordered out a score of soldiers to pursue and bring him back. But the
Prince ofSilla was so loved by Koguryo people for his deeds ofkindness
that the soldiers shot at him with headless arrows and thus be escaped
and arrived safely at the royal palace of Silla.
When the King saw Pohae he embraced him with the tenderest
affection, shedding tears of both joy and sorrow, saying "I have re­
gained one arm of my body, one eye of my face, but I am still sad
without the other."
"Your Majesty," Pak Che-sang replied, "only command and I
will bring back Prince Mihae 16 also." He prostrated himselfbefore the
throne, striking his head twice on tpe floor, and took leave of the King.
Without even visiting his home he journeyed to the seacoast at Yulp'o.
His wife pursued him on a white horse, but when she arrived at
the port he had already embarked and was sailing far over the blue
sea. She wept and called to him to return for a last farewell, but her
loyal husband only waved his hand and sailed straight on.
Pak soon reached the Japanese island where Mihae was being held,
and was received in audience by the king. "Who are you and what
has brought you here?" the king asked.
"I am a nobleman of Kerim (another name for Silla)" Pak replied.
"The king of Kerim killed my father and brothers without legitimate
reason, so r escaped and drifted to your sh~res seeking asylum."
"The king of Shiragi (SilIa) is not good," responded the Japanese
ruler. "I will give you a comfortable house to live in."
Pak Che-,ang soon made contact with Prince Mihae and the two
began to go fishing on the seashore everyr,porning. They made a prac­
tice of presenting their catch regularly t~ the king, who was highly
pleased and suspected nothing. Finally their opportunIty came, a
day when thick fog covered the island. As they put out to sea in their
-6.. 3 ­

Sa,nguk Yusa
fi~hing boat, Pak said, "Prince, today yeu must escape. It is now or
never."
"I want you to come with me," the prince replied.
"If we go together," counselled Pak, "the Japanese will pursue
us. I must stay behind to prevent them."
The prince was distressed. "I look up to you like my own father
and elder brother. How can I leave you behind and go alone?"
"If 1 can save your life and comfort my king I will be content. 1
cannot think only of myself."
Pak poured wine into a cup and offered it to the prince in farewell.
Then he ordered Kang Ku-ry<S, a Silla boatman, to take the prince
with him under full sail. He returned to Mihae's quarters and stayed
there till the following morning. When the Japanese became curious,
Pak came out and told them that Mihae had been hunting the previous
day and was relaxing in bed. At noon they came again, and Pak at last
told them that Mihae had escaped a long while before.
The king was very angry and ordered cavalrymen to go in pursuh,
but to no avail. He had Pak Che-sang arrested and brought before him.
"Why did you send the prince home without my knowledge?'
"I am a subject ofKerim and not your vassal. I have simply obeyed
the command of my king. I have no more to say."
The king became angrier still. "You became my vassal and now
you say no. What an insolent: fenow you are! Now you must suffer
the five penaltifts (extreme tonure ))\1 But even now, jif you will become
my subject, I will give you big rewards and make you rich and noble!'
But there was no persuading the loyal Pak. "I would rather be a
dog or a pig in Kerim than a nobleman, in Japan. I would rather be
beaten with long whips in Kerim tIlan receive court titles here."
"Here, men! Peel off his skin from thigJitoankle and make him
walk on the swordlike stubble of the harvested reeds." (Ily<Sn points
out here that an old tradition attributed the red color of a certain
variety ofreed to the blood of Pak Che-sang.)
When Pak had been tortured for a time the king said, "Now,
fellow! Of what kingdom are you a subject?"
-64­Wonder 1
'''1 am a subject of Kerim."
"Stand him on red-hot iron." The men did so. "Now whose
'Vassal are you?"
"I am a vassal of the' King of Kerim."
"You are straight like a bamboo, unbending and unyielding.
'But you are of no service to me. Hang him, men." So the Japanese
hanged him on a tree on Kishima and burned him to death.
Meanwhile, Mihae crossed the eastern sea and landed safely in
: Sma. He sent Kang Ku-ry<S, the sailor, to the palace to inform the King
·of his arrival. His Majesty expressed great joy and commanded his
'courtiers to meet the returning prince on the coast. Together with
· Prince Pohae he went out to the southern outskirts of Ky<Sngju, and
'when he saw Mihae, fell on his neck and wept for joy.
The King gave a g.reat banquet at the palace and proclaimed a
: general amnesty throughout the kingdom. He conferred the title of
· Grand Duchess on the wife ofPak Che-sang and married Prince Mihae
'to her daughter.
The courtiers praised the noble deeds of Pak Che-sang, saying,
'''In old China a vassal of Han named Chou Ko was capturoo by the
soldiers of Ch'u in Yingyang. Hsiang Yii said to Chou Ko, 'If you
become my vassal I will make you a governor, rich and noble.' But
Chou Ko would not yield and suffered death at the hand of Hsiang
Vii. Now Pak Che-sang's unswerving loyalty· outshines that of Chou
Ko."
Pak Che-sang's wife, overwhelmed with grief, prostrated herself
'On the sand beach south of Mangdok temple gate and cried long and
bitterly. People still call the place Changsa. m~aning long sand. The
good lady could not long endure the yearning of her heart for her
husband, who would return no more. She took her three daughters
with her to Ch'isul-Iy<sng (Kite Pass) in themount~ins. There she looked
away in the direction of Japan and wailed,Jor sorrow till she died. She
.became the tutelary spirit 'Of Kite Pass, and the people of Silla erected I
~ shrine to her there.' --l

drum. Becoming curious he asked the villagers what it was all about,
a~d a little girl told him that the daughter of a nobleman had been .
washing clothes in a mountain stream and had relieved herself in the
r forest.
Now really intrigued, the courtier visited the nobleman's house
and found that the girl was indeed a giant, seven feet five inches tall.
He hastened to inform the King, who immediately sent a royal carriage
drawn by two horses to bring her to the court. There they were married
and lived happily. (Another source gives her family name as Pak. She
was popularly known as Yonje Puin, the lady of the long emperor.)
During King Chich'oIlo's reign the people of DIlling-do (Dagelet
Island), two days' sail to the east, ceased to pay tribute to the
King's court, boasting that the deep sea was their ally. The King was
very angry and commanded General Pak Hong to go to the island and
punish its disobedient inhabitants. Pak had wooden lions made and
mounted them on the decks of his ships. Then he sailed to Dllling-do,
and said to the islanders, "If you do not surrender we will set the lions
upon you." Much afraid, the people fell on their knees and begged for
peace. The King rewarded Pak I-jong and made him governor of
DIlling-do.
28. King CbIohWig (540-576)
The twenty-fourth sovereign.was, King Chinhling. He was crown­
ed king at the age of fifteen (the Samguk Sagi says seven), with his
mother as regent. She was King PophUng's daughter, wife of Ipjong­
Kalmun-wang (PophUng's younger brother.)
On his deathbed, King ChinhUng had his head shaved and suffered
bis royal person to be clad in the robe, of a Buddhist monk. (An ex­
traordinary act of piety which would have been thought beneath the
dignity of a king.)
In the ninth moon of the third year of Chengsheng, an army from
Paekje invaded Chinsong and carried off 39.000 people, both male and
female, together with 8,000 horses. Previously Paekje had proposed
-68 ­Wonder 1
to Silla that the two kingdoms launch a joint attack on Koguryo.
King Chinhling flatly refused, however, saying "The rise and fall of
kingdoms depends upon heaven. If Koguryo has not provoked the
wrath of heaven, how can I dare to attack her?" When he heard of this
the king of Koguryo was deeply moved, and strengthened his ties with
Silla. This caused the exasperated king of Paekje to vent his anger by
attacking Silla.
29. Tohwanyo and Pihyongnang
The twenty-fifth ruler of Silla was King Saryun (posthumous name
Chinji, 576-579). His family name was Kim and his queen was Lady
Chido, a daughter of Kio-kong. During his short reign he was hated
by the people for his misgovernment and sexual indulgence. For these
reasons he was ultimately deposed.
While he was on the throne there lived in Saryang-pu a country
woman who was so beautiful that people called her Tohwarang or
Tohwanyo, meaning Peach Girl. The King heard of her extraordinary
beauty and had her brought to the inner palace.
"Tohwarang," he said, "you are my peach. I love you and I must
enjoy you tonight." And he attempted to take her in his arms.
"Let me go!" she cried. "I am a married woman and I cannot
accept your love. My body belongs to my husband and him only. Even
a king or an emperor shall not take away my woman's treasure."
"What a bold wenchl" the King said angrily. "Don't you know
lam an absolute monarch and everything in the kingdom belongs to
me? I can take any pretty woman I want for mytoncubine. If you do
not obey my command, 1 will kill you. Do you still dare to say no?"
But the woman was resolute. "I would rather die than be your
mistress."
The King laughed. "If ~our husband were to die, would you come
to me?"
She was crying now. "Yes, then it would be possible,"
The King sighed resignedly and said, "Go home in peace but do
-(j 9­

Samguk Yusa
not forget me, for I w11l keep your beauty in my heart forever."
The woman sobbed, "May you live ten thousand years, 0 King!"
and left the palace.
In that same year the king was deposed, and died soon afterwards.
Three years later the woman's husband died, and ten days later the king
appeared to her at midnight, looking just as he had in Ii fe.
"You gave me a promise long ago," he said, "and now your hus­
band is no more. Will you come to me and be my lover?"
"Yes, but first I must ask the advice of my parents."
Tohwarang's parents told her that the command of a king must
be obeyed. So she arrayed herself as a bride and entered her bed­
chamber. She did not emerge for seven days and nights, during which
time the scent of incense emanated from the room and five-colored
clouds hovered constantly over the roof ofthe house. Then she emerged
alone, her royal lover having vanished, and eventually it was found that
she was pregnant. When the hour ofher confinement drew near heaven
and earth shook with thunder. The child was a boy, whom she named
Pihyongnang.
When King Chinp'yong, Chinji's successor (579-632), heard this
story, he had Tohwarang and her baby brought to the palace to live,
and when the boy was fifteen he was made a knight. (This probably
means that he was enrolled in the order of Hwarang, a quasi-military,
quasi-religious organization ofaristocratic youth in the SiIla kingdom.)
It was noticed at court that the boy often wandered far from the
palace at night alone and the king, becoming curious, one night
assigned fifty soldiers to keep watch over him. Early next morning
the captain of the soldiers reported to the King as follows:
"Your Majesty, we saw Pihyong fly over Moon Castle and land
on the bank of Hwangch'on Stream (west of Kyongju). There he dis­
ported himself with a crowd of spirits from heaven and goblins from
earth until the ringing of the temple bell at dawn. Then he dismissed
his ghostly crew and turned his flying footsteps toward the palace."
Pihyong was summoned to the throne forthwith, and the King
enquired, "Is it true that you consort with ghosts and goblins?"
70­Wonder 1
"Yes, sire, it is true."
"Then I command you to build a bridge across the stream north
of Sinwon Temple."
"I obey, sire'/'
He gathered all his ghosts and goblins together and conveyed the
royal order to them. They fell to at once, and by morning a stone
bridge across the stream had been completed. The King was pleased,
and called it Kwi-gyo, the Bridge of Ghosts. Thinking to make further
use of Pihyong's supernatural acquaintances, he then asked, "Do you
know any ghost who could return to life and assist the throne in ad­
ministration ?"
"Yes," replied Piyhy6ng, "Kildal is a fine statesman."
"Bring him to me."
The following morning Pihy6ng presented Kildal before the
throne. The King made him a courtier, and found him to be loyal and
straight as a bamboo. He commanded Yim Chong, the grand vizier,
to adopt Kildal as his son, since Yim had no son ofhis own. Yim Chong
complied, and later ordered Kildal to erect a pavilion south of Hung­
nyun Temple and to stand guard there day and night, for which reason
the temple entrance became known as Kildal Gate.
But one day Kildal changed himself into a fox and ran away.
(Foxes are closely associated with ghosts and spirits in East Asian
folklore, somewhat as cats are in the West.) Pihyong then sent the other
ghosts and goblins to catch Kildal and kill him instantly. ·.,After this
all the bad ghosts and goblins feared Pihyong and came to him no more.
The people of Silla praised Pihyong in a song which goes as follows:
Here stands the house of Pihyong, ,
Strong son of the love-spirit of our great king.
All dancing devils, do not come but go away;
Fear the ghost-general and do not stay.
It became a custom to paste up copie~ of this song on the gates
of commoners' houses as a protection against evil spirits.

30: 1be Jade Belt from Heaven
The twenty-sixth sQvereign Qf Silla was King Paekji5ng (PQsthu­
mQUS title Chinp'yong, 579-632). He ascended the throne in the eighth
mQQn Qfthe eleventh year Qf Takien Qf Hsiian-ti Qf Chen (579) even
in the year Qf Kihae. He was eleven feet tall.
On Qne QccasiQn King Chinp'yong visited Ch'onju Temple, which
had been cQnstructed at his Qrder. As he was ascending the stQne steps,
three Qf them broke beneath his weight. He gave nO' sign Qf surprise,
hQwever, and tQld his attendant to leave the stQnes as they were to' shQW
his succeSSQrs. These stQnes still exist and are cQunted amQng the five
"immQvable" stQnes in the walled city Qf Kyongju.
In the year Qf King Chinp'yi5ng's cQrQnatiQn, an angel frQm hea­
ven appeared befQre the thrQne and said, "The heavenly emperQr has
cQmmanded me to' deliver this jade belt to' yQU as his gift. Rise and
accept it." When the King had accepted the heavenly gift with due de­
CQrum, the angel flew back to' heaven. Silla kings from that time Qn
always WQre this jade belt while attending impQrtant sacrificial rites.

LQng afterwad Wang Kon, the fQunder Qf the KQryo dynasty
(PQsthumQus title T'aejQ) cautiO'ned his generals and Qfficials Qn the:
eve Qf his cQnquest Qf Silla (935): "I fQrbid yQU to' lay hands Qn the

Rebuild the palace with steel fQr him to' tread!
(Jade was not only regarded as precious and beautiful but also had
religious significance, One of the Chinese deities was known as the Jade
Emperor.)
31. The Tbree Propbesies of Queen Sondok
The twenty-seventh sQvereign of Silla was Queen Tokman (PQst­
humQus title Si5ndi5k, 632-647). She was the daughter of King Chin­
p'YQng and ascended the thrQne in the sixth year (Imjin) Qf Chen-kuan
of T'ang T'ai-tsung, During her reign she made three remarkable pro­
phecies.
First, the Emperor T'ai-tsung (Qf the Chinese T'ang dynasty)
sent her a gift of three hand~uls of peony seeds with a picture of the
flQwers in red, white and purple. The Queen looked at the picture for
a while and said, "The flQwers will have no fragrance." The peonies
were planted in the palace garden, and sure enQugh they had no Qdor
from the time they bloomed until they faded.
Second, in the Jade Gate PQnd at the Holy Shrine Temple'a crQwd
of frogs gathered in winter (when fr~gs :;.re normally hibernating) and
croaked for three or fQur days. The people and court:ers wondered
at this, and asked the Queen what its significanc~ might be. She im­
mediately cQmmanded two gener::l.ls, Alch'on and P'i1t'an, to lead two
thousand crack troQPs to Woman's Reot Valley c·n tI,e western out­
skirts of Ky5ngju to search Qut and kill enemy troops hidden in the
fureM. ~
The generals set Qff with a thousand troops each, and when they
reached the valley fQund five hundred Paekje soldiers hidden in the
forest there. The Silla soldiers surrounded them and killed them all.
-73·­

Samguk Yusa
Then they found a Paekje general hiding behind a rock on South Moun~
tain, whom they also killed. Finally, they intercepted a large Paekje
force marching to invade Silla. This they routed, killing one thousand
three hundred in the process.
Third, one day while the Queen was still in perfect health, she
called her courtiers together and said, "I will surely die in a certain
year, in a certain month, on a certain day. When I am gone, bury me
in the middle of Torich'on." The courtiers did not know the place and
asked the Queen where it was, whereupon she pointed to the southern
hill called Wolf Mountain.
On the very day she had predicted the Queen died, and her ashes
were interred on the site she had chosen. Ten years later (656) the great·
King Munmu had Sach'onwang Temple (the Temple ofthe Four Deva
Kings) built beneath the Queen's tomb. Buddhist scripture alludes to
two heavens caIled-Torich'on and Sach'onwangch'on. All were
amazed at the Queen's prescience and knowledge of the afterlife.
(The second temple was presumably built further down the hill,
not directly under the tomb. The four deva kings are the Buddhist
guardian spirits of the four directions, and representations of them are
to befound at the entrance gates ofmost Korean Buddhist temples. King
Munmu (661-681) could have been living in 656 but could not have
been reigning as the date is early in the reign of his predecessor King
MurylJl. 654-661.}
During her lifetime the courtiers asked the Queen how she had
been able to make these prophecies. She replied: "In the picture there
were flowers but not butterflies, an indication that peonies have no
smell. The T'ang Emperor teased my having no husband. As to the
frogs at Jade Gate Pond, they seemed like soldiers, and Jade gate refers
the female genitals (and so is similar to the name of the valley, which
also contains the expression Okmun, jade gate). The female color is
white, which is also the color symbolic of the west, so I knew the in­
vaders were coming from the west (i.e. from Paekje) .. If a male organ
enters a female organ it will surely die (lose its erection after orgasm),
so I knew it would be easy to defeat the enemy.19
-74­Wonder I
(-The Tang emperor who sent the picture ofpeonies in three colors
meant it to symbolize the three queens of Korea, Sond6k, Chindok and
Chinsong, so perhaps he too had knowledge of the future. Chindok suc­
ceeded Sondok, 'reigning from 647 to 654, and Queen Chinsong did
not ascend the throne until 888.)
The book Yangjisa-jon contains a detailed description of Queen
Sondok's erection of Yongmyo (Holy Shrine) Temple. It was also this
queen who built the stone astronomical observatory called Ch'omsong­
dae. (This last still stands in Kyongju and is one of the most famous
sights in Korea.)
32. Queen Chindok (647-654)
Queen Chind6k was the twenty-eighth ruler of SiIIa. During her
reign she composed a poem called T'aep'yong-ga, the song of peaceful
reign. This, together with a piece of silk brocade which she had woven
and embroidered, she sent to the Tang Emperor in China. In great
delight, the Emperor invested the Queen with the title ofruler of Kerim.
(Jlyon mentions a variant account from another source here, mostly
because ofa discrepancy in dates. But the real significance ofthis episode
is that Si/la was to cOllquer the other two kingdoms shortly with the help
of Tang Chinese armies, and subsequently to acknol'.1edge Tang suze­
rainty, though there was little Chinese interference at home. The Si/la
kings, however, agreed to seek official confirmation from· the Chinese
court of their accession to the throne, and no Korean monarch. thereafter
was regarded as a legitimate ruler unless he had the assent ofthe Chinese
Emperor.)
Poem: "Great T'ang created the powerful Cel~~tial Empire,
The glorious royal achievements so high bloom for aye;
The reigning monarch ceases war giving his soldiers rest,
He esteems culture as a noble heir to a.hundred Kings.
He presides over wide heaven and,sends down sweet rain;
He rules over the whole creation and gives luster to everything­
His deep benevolence is matched only by the sun,~p.d moon.
His circulating fortunes tum toward the world ofYao and Shun:
-',75­

Samguk ¥USQ
Brightly his banners flutter, covering the sky,
Loudly his gongs and drums ring, filling the earth.
Foreign barbarians who disobey the Emperor's.~mmands
Fall to his swords and suffer heavy penalties;
Love and respect for warm-heartedness under bis sway
Shine on myriads in light and shade.
Far and near happy people vie in raising voices
To praise his august virtues.
The four seasons rotate harmoniously like burning candles;
The seven luminaries shine wide all over the universe.
From the high mountain descend his assisting ministers,
The Emperor entrusts his administration to loyal vassals.
The virtues of the five emperors and three kings in one
Radiant body illuminate our T'ang sovereign"
( Afew notes will be helpful here. The seven lights were the sun and moon
and the five planets then known, which were thought to correspond to the
five elements which the Chinese believed were the basic materials of the
universe. They were fire (Mars), water (Mercury), wood (Jupiter),
gold (Venus), and earth (Sa1urn). The "high mountain" referred to is
in tlte Kunlun mountains far to the west, and the line is quoted/rom the
Confucian Classic Book oj Odes. YaQ; and Shun, together with the five
emperors and three kings, were legendary rulers ofChina, whom its people
believed had introduce'/ the arts ofcivilization.}
One day six ofthe Queen's distinguished courtiers-Alch'on-gong.
Yimjong-gong, Suljong-gong, Horim-gong (father of the famous monk
Chajang), Yomjang-gong and Yusin-gong-held a meeting on a giant
rock on South Mountain to discuss state affairs. Suddenly a big tiger
rushed in among them. The other courtiers shrieked in fear, but
Alch'on-gong only laughed. He seized the tiger by the tail, swung it
against a rock and dashed out its brains.
In respect for his great strength and courage the courtiers offered
Alch' on-gong the presiding seat at their meeting, but they admired
most the majestic air and wise strategy of Yusin-gong. (This last was
Quite possibly the famous Kim Yu-sin, who comes next. "Gong" was
76­Wonder 1
evidently a title of rank.)
Silla had four sacred places where state ministers held councils
on national issues to insure success (Le. the sacred nature of the places
insured success). These were Ch'ongsong Mountain in the east, Kaeji
Mountain in the south, P'ijon in the west and KUmgang Mountain
in the north. During the reign ofQueen Chindok the first royal audience
was given on New Year's Day. The title of Sirang was first conferred
on high dignitaries during her reign.
(Some Korean historians hold that these council meetings were
a survival of the meetings of clan leaders that preceded the formation
of the monarchical government. They ceased after the unification.)
33. Kim Yu-sin
( Kim Yu-sin was a close relative ofthe royal family and a famous general.
It was mostly under hiS direction that the kingdoms of Paekje and
Koguryo were conquered in cooperation with forces from T'ang China
and the peninsula unified under Silla rule.)
In the seventeenth year of King Chinp'yong, even in the year of
Ulmyo (595) Kim Yu-sin was born to the royal Kim family of Sohyon­
Kakkan, the son of Horyok-I Kan. (These last are evidently titles.)
Seven star-crests were seen on the baby's back. His younger brother was
Hum-sun and his two younger sisters were Po-hui (Ahae) and Mun­
hili (Aji).
From his childhood he was admired by all who knew him for his
wonderful deeds, and they called him the seven-star general. At the
age of eighteen he mastered the art of swordsmanship and became a
\
Hwarang (the patriotic youth organization mentioned earlier).20
Now among the Hwarang there was a doubtful character named
Paek-sok (White Stone) who had mingled with them for many years,
though nobody knew his origin. He knew that Yu-sin was making plans
day and night to conquer Koguryo and Paekje. One night he whispered
secretly to Yu-sin, "'My comrade, we must spy out tQe enemy's true
strength before we go to attack him."

Yu-sin gladly agreed, and soon thereafter they set out on their
journey. One day as they paused on a mountain-top to rest, two girls
appeared from the forest and followed after Yu-sin. When they arrived
at the village of Kolhwach'on to put up for the night, a third girl
appeared, and all three,in a most engaging manner, presented delicious
cakes for Yu-sin to eat. (Paek-sok was presumably somewhere else and
knew nothing ofthis.) Yu-sin was transported with joy and immediately
fell in love with the three of them.
"My beautiful ladies," he said, "you are three laughing flowers
and I am a humming bee. Will you suffer me to suck honey from your
golden hearts the whole night?"
"Yes," they replied coyly, "we understand. Come to the forest
with us and there we shall have our pleasure in beds of fragrant flowers,
unseen and unheard by the other boy."
So Yu-sin went into the forest with the three girls, but as soon as
they arrived the girls changed into noble goddesses. "We are no laugh iog
flowers or nymphs," they told Yu-sin, "but three goddesses who
guard the three sacred mountains-Naerim, Hyollye and Kolhwa. We
have come to warn you that you are being lured by an enemy spy. Be
on your guard! F arewelll" And with these words the three goddesses
rose into the sky and flew away.
Yu-sin prostrated himself in amazement and gratitude before the
departing goddesses and then returned to his tavern in Kolhwa-kwan
where Paek-sok was fast asleep. ):arly next morning Yu-sin awakened
him and said, "Look! We started on a long journey to a foreign coun­
try in such a hurry that I forgot my purse, and left it at home. Let's go
back and get it before proceeding any farther."
Paek-sok suspected nothing, and they returned to Ky<5ngju, where
Yu-sin immediately had him arrested and bound hand and foot.
"Fellow!" he roared, "drop your Hwarang disguise and confess the
truth!"
Completely cowed, Paek-s<5k confessed. "I am a man of Kogury5.
The officials of my king's court believe that Kim Yu-sin of Silla is the
reincarnation of Ch'u-nam, a renowned fortune-teller in my country.
-78 ­Wonder I
"Listen! On the frontier between Silla· and Koguryo there .is a'
river that flows backwards. So King Pojang (642-668) called Ch'u­
nam to the inner palace and said to him, 'Look here! Why does the
water of this river flow backwards, upside down and inside out? Why
do they call it Ungja::'su (male and female water) while all other streams
are called Jaung-su (female and male water)? Can you tell me whether
this has any unusual significance?'
" 'Your Majesty,' replied the soothsayer, 'the Queen acts against
the natural course of urn (yin) and yang, and the abnormal situation
in the royal bed-chamber is reflected on the mirror-like surface of the
river.'"
(This is in reference to yin and yang, the male andfemale principles
whose interrelations are the basis of all natural processes in Chinese
philosophy. Ch'u-nam is implying that the Queen is the real ruler and
not the King, an evil situation from the contemporary point of
view.)
"'( am perplexed with shame,' the King said.
"The Queen was angry. 'He talks nonsense,' she said. 'This is a
disloyal libel by a cunning fox to undermine the Queen's position.'
"'[ have told the truth, Your Majesty,' said Ch'u-nam. "What
is done in the shade is brought into the light by my magic art."
"0 King,' said the Queen, 'if he knows everything let him answer
one more question, and if he is wrong let himsufl'er a heavy penalty."
She retired to her inner chamber and returned with a box in which
she had concealed a large rat.
" 'What is in the box?' the King asked.
" 'A rat,' said Ch'u-nam.
" 'How many rats?' asked the Queen.
" 'Eight.'
" 'Your answer is wrong,' the Queen said triumphantly, 'and you
shall die.'
" 'When I am dead,' said C;hu'u-nam,~I shall be reborn as a great
general who will destroy Koguryo.' ,
"So they cut off Ch'u-nam's head. But when they slit open the

"belly ofthe rat they found seven unborn rats in it. Then everyone in the
palace knew that Ch'unam had told the truth. On that very night King
Pojang had a dream in which he saw the spirit of Ch'u-nam enter the
bosom of the wife of Sohyon-gong (Kim Yu-sin's father) in Silla. The
King awoke in astonishment and discussed the matter with his cour­
tiers. They remembered Ch'u-nam's vow and sent me to take you to
Koguryo. So here I am."
Yu-sin put the Koguryo spy to the sword and offered sacrifices of
.a hundred delicacies to the three goddesses who had saved his life.
When Yu-sin's wife Lady Chaemae died, they buried her in the
upper valley of Ch'ongyon (Blue Pool), which has been known as
Chaemae Valley ever since. Every spring when the birds and flowers
returned the royal Kim clan used to gather on the bank of a stream in
a pine forest there to feast and do honor to her spirit. They also erected
a small temple there called Songhwa-bang (Pine-Flower Hermitage)
dedicated to her.
During the reign of King Kyongmyong the fifty-fourth sovereign
{9 I 7-924), the King conferred on Yu-sin the posthumous title of
Hilngmu-Taewang (Great King of Mars). His tomb now stands on a
mountain peak, facing east, to the northeast of Moji Temple on the
West Mountain.
34. T'aejong Ch'unch'u-gong (King Muryo!. 654-(61)
The twenty-ninth ruler of Silla was Kim Ch'un-ch'u, known as
T'aejong the Great. His father was Yongsu-kakkan, his mother was
Lady Ch'onmyong, a daughter of King Chinp'yong, and his Queen
was Munmyong-hwanghu, Mun-hili, the youngest sister of Kim Yu­
sin.
One night Mun-hili's sister Po-hili had a dream in which she clim­
bed up So-ak Mountain and urinated, and the stream of water from her
body rolled down in cataracts and inundated the whole city of Kyongiu.
In the morning she told her sister about it. "
"That is very interesting," said Mun-hili, "I will buy your ~am:'
-80­Wonder 1
"What will you give me for in" Po-hili asked.
"I will give you my skirt of embroidered brocade."
"Very well. I agree."
Mun-hili spread her skirt and said, "I am ready to catch your
dream."
"Fine \" laughed Po-hili. "I give you my dream of last night."
Mun-hili smiled. "Thank you, sister. Here is my skirt. Wear it and you
will look more beautiful."
Ten days later while Yu-sin and Ch'un-ch'u were playing ball on
the Festival of the Crow (see above. "The shooting of the harp-case"),
he accidentally stepped on a ribbon which was trailing from Ch'un­
ch'u's jacket and tore it off. "I am sorry, " said Yu-sin. "Come with
me to my house and we will have your ribbon sewn back on."
"Don't worry about it," said Ch'unch'u, and the two youths
went off to the ladies' quarters. Yu-sin called to Po-hili to come and
sew on the ribbon, but she was too shy and said it would be improper
for her to be with a young man. Then he called to Mun-hi1i, and she
came and sewed on the ribbon, blushing deeply all the while. Ch'unch'u
fell in love with her on the spot and from then on visited her day and
night.
Somewhat later Yu-sin discovered that Mun-hili was pregnant,
He was furious and immediately began preparations to have her burned
to death as an example to all immoral women.
That day when Queen Sondok went up South Mountain for a
picnic she noticed flames and smoke rising to the sky. Upon inquiring
of her attendants, she learned that Yu-sin was about to burn his sister
to death because an illicit love affair had resultrd in her pregnancy.
The Queeri looked around and noticed that Ch'un-ch'u was as pale
as death.
"So it was you!" she said. "Go quickly and save the girl!" Ch'un­
ch'u leaped on his horse and galloped quickly to Yu-sin's house. shout­
ing, "Queen's order! Queeri~s order! Do not put her to death!" And
so Mun-hili was saved.
A few days later Ch'un'ch'u and Mun-hl1i were formally married.

Following the death of Queen Chind6k he was elevated to the throne
in the fifth year ofT'ang Kao-tsung (654) and ruled eight years, dying
at the age of fifty-nine. They buried him near Aegong Temple and
erected a magnificent stone monument with beautiful carvings on it
which is known as Muryol-wang-nnng (the Tomb of King Muryol).
Because this king succeeded in conquering and adding to SilIa the
three Han territories (Mahan, Chinhan and Py6nhan, in the south)
with the assistance of Kim Yu-sin, one of the most valiant and skillful
generals Korea had ever produced, he was given the posthumous title
T'aejong (T'ai-tsung in Chinese), which means "grand ancestor" (and
was customarily given to the second ruler in a dynasty; llyon is pointing
out that it was an exceptional mark ofhonor to award this title to Ch'un­
ch'u.)
His six sons, the princes Papmin, Inmun, Munwang, Notan,
Chigyong and Kaewon, were all born of Mun-Mi, who thus fulfilled
her sister's dream, flooding the capital with the issue of her body. In
addition she brought up eight children (three boys and five girls) born
to the King of concubines and court ladies.
As for meals, the King ate three bushels of rice and nine pheasants
a day. After the conquest of Paekje in 660 he stopped eating lunch,
but his daily food amounted to six bushels of rice, six bushels (7) of
wine and ten pheasants. During his reign one roll (40 yards) of cotton
cloth could be bartered for thirty to fifty large bags of rice, and all the
people praised his benevolent rule. (It is unlikely that the King alone
consumed such quantities of food. Probably tlte daily supplies of his
court are intended here.)
While he was crown prince he visited Changan, the capital ofT'ang
China, to ask for military aid in his coming conquest of Koguryo.
The Emperor admired his majestic deportment and invited him to stay
at the Chinese court, but he excused himself and returned to Silla.
In those days the eldest son of King Mu of Paekje (600-641) was
praised for his moral integrity and military valor. But no sooner had
he ascended the throne, in the fifteenth year of T'ang T'ai-tsung (641)
than he gave himself up to drink and debauchery and forsook the
- 8 2­Wonder J
demanding duties of government. A loyal vassal, S6ng Ch'ung called
Chwap'y6ng (this is an official title for Minister of State) remonstrated
with the King, warning him of the imminence of foreign attack, for
which patriotic action lie was thrown into prison, where he died after
sending a memorial to the throne advising the fortification of the
mouth of the Paek-Kang (White River now Knm-gang) at KibOlp'o
(Now Changhang) against the coming of a Chinese fleet and the streng­
thening of fortifications at T'anhyon (Charcoal Pass) along the border
with SilIa, but the dissolute King Uija paid no heed to this prophetic
advice.
(The unlikely events described in the following paragraphs are all
evil omens. It will be recalled that foxes especially were associated with
ghosts and spirits, and that white is the color of mourning, and hence
of death, in East Asia.)
In the fourth year of Hsienking of the T'ang Emperor Kao-tsung
(659), a large red horse appeared at Ohoe-sa (Ohap-sa) Temple in
Paekje and galloped around the temple six times. In the second moon
of that year many foxes entered the palace of King Dijll and a white
fox jumped up on the monarch'sjade table and sat there for a long time.
In the fourth moon a hen in the palace of the crown prince mated
with a little bird that swooped down from the sky.
In the fifth moon a thirty-foot-Iong fish leaped out of the water
and died on the bank of Sabi-su (a river in Puy6), and everyone who
ate the flesh of this fish died.
In the ninth moon the awe-inspiring giant oaks in the palace
gardens wailed with human voices, and during the nights ghosts and
goblins cried on the boulevar~ south of the palac~\
In the second moon ofthe fifth year (660), the water in all the wells
of Puy6 and in Sabi-su (White-Horse River or Knm-gang) turned
blood-red, and small fish leaped out of the water on the western sea­
shore and fell dead. There were so many that the people could not
collect ana eat them all. '
In the fourth moon tens of thousands of frogs appeared in the
treetops. The citizens of the capital ran out of their houses in fear, and
- 8 J'­

Samguk Yusa
fell dead by hundreds as if they had been attacked from behind, aod.
people lost their fortunes by thousands.
In the sixth moon, the monks of Wanghung Temple saw.as in a
mirage a forest of ship's masts rush into the temple on the rising tide,
and dogs as big as deer leaped from the west to the banks of Sabi-su,
barked at the palace and were gone. The dogs of the city gathered in
packs on the roads, where they barked and howled in chorus and then
scattered with mournful whines. A terrifying ghost entered the palace
and cried loudly, "Paekje is ruined! Paekje is ruined I" and then
descended into the bowels of the earth.
King Uija ordered his servants to dig in the ground where the ghost
had disappeared and at a depth of three feet they found a turtle with
ten Chinese characters carved on its back which read, "Paekje is a
round moonwheel; Silla is a new moon." The King called for a fortune­
teller, and asked him what the inscription meant. The .aged soothsayer
replied, " 'Round moonwheel' means a full moon, which is about to
wane; the 'new moon' will grow larger and larger night by night."
The king was angry and had the fortune-teller put to death. Then a
courtier flattered him, saying, "Your Majesty, 'round moonwheel'
signifies the zenith of power, and 'new moon' represents the weak and
small. This means that Paekje is a large kingdom and Silla is a small
kingdom." The King laughed for joy.
When King Muryol of Silla (Kim Ch'un-ch'u) heard of these gro­
tesque events, he said "These are signs of the doom of Paekje." In the
fifth year of Hsienking (660) he dispatched Kim In-mun to the T'ang
court to ask for military aid.
The Emperor Kao-tsung ordered out 130,000 crack troops under
the command of his Left Tiger Guard General Su Ting-fang and his
'subordinates Liu Po-ying, Feng Shih-kuei and Pang Hsiao-kung. They
crossed the sea on 1,900 war vessels and attacked Paekje. (Ilyon notes
here that local records put the number ofT'ang troops at 122,711, but
that no definite figure is given in the official T'ang history.) Moreover
the Emperor appointed King Muryol commander of ground forces
and asked him to send Silla troops to fight on the side of the T'ang
-84­Wonder 1
army.
When general Su's forces arrived at Tokmul Island to the west of
Silla, King Muryol commanded general Kim Yu-sin to lead 50,000
picked warriors to cooperate with the Chinese army.
General Su landed his troops at the mouth of the White Horse
River and quickly defeated the Paekje defenders. At the same time,
his warships rode a favorable tide up the river to the accompaniment of
fifes and drums. The T'ang cavalry and infantry killed tens of thou­
sands of Paekje soldiers and laid siege to Puyo, the capital.
Meanwhile the SiIla army crossed the sky-kissing mountains
through the high pass ofT'anhyon. The patriotic general Kyebaek led
his 5,000 soldiers up to the plains of Hwangsan (now Yon san), where
he ordered them to hold or die. At first, through valiant efforts, they
were able to halt the superior Silla force, but not for long. The general
fell on the field of honor, and the last defensive line ofPaekje had been
broken.
The T'ang and Silla forces now settled down before the gates of
Puyo while the two commanders planned a coordinated attack. At this
time a fierce bird circled around the head of general Su, and a fortune­
teller said it was an omen of his sure death in the coming battle. The
general trembled from head to foot and was about to order his men to
turn back. But Kim Yu-sin unsheathed his long sword, struck the
swooping bird dead, and laid it at the general's feet, saying "A small
grotesque bird cannot interfere with our great expedition against a
bad king."
King Uija and his crown prince fled to Ungjin, while his second
son Prince T'ae assumed the throne and fought valiantly against the
invaders. But seeing his followers desert him and flee, " he opened the
city gates and surrendered. General Su captured King Uija and Crown
Prince Yung. He also took prisoner two further priJ?ces, the aforesaid
T'ae and Prince Yon, eighty-eight high official~and generals, and 12,807
Paekje civilians. All these he t0pk away to the T'ang capital, Changan.
Originally Paekje was divided into -five provinces, tl1!~~y-seven
counties, 200 towns and 760,000 households. But the victorious Chinese
- 8 S;:;::­

Sllmguk }"uJ't/
reorganized it and placed a Chinese military governor in each of the
provinces to take charge of the local administration. General Liu
Jen~yuan was put in command of Chinese forces occupying PuyO
while general Wang Wen~tao was appointed governor of Ungjin (now
Kongju) with the special task of pacifying the defeated Paekje troops.
(The significance of this was that the Tang gorernment plainZv
intended to incorporate Paekje into the Chinese empin: afact Irhicfr u'as
not lost upon Silla.)
General Su presented his prisoners to the T'ang Emperor, who,
after rebuking them, set them free. When King Uija died of an illness
soon after, the Emperor conferred a posthumous title on him, ordered
a royal funeral and had him buried beside the tombs of Sun Hao and
Chen Shu-pao. (These were the tombs of the rulers of states during
two periods of Chines(! disunity. By his action the Emperor, while /'ec~
ognizing Uija as having been a legitimate ruler, also announced that the
Paekje kingdom was now defunct like the states ruled by the (WO whose
tombs neighbored Uija's and implied that Paekje was now under Chinese
rule.)
In the secohd year of Lungshuo (662) Emperor Kao-tsung or­
dered out another large force under general Su Ting-fang to attack
Koguryo. These troops defeated a Koguryo army in the battle of P'ae­
gang and surrounded P'yongyang. But the valiant defenders held them
off and they were unable to take the city. Finally the Chinese troops
were routed in an attack during a snowstorm and forced to scatter and
flee.
Returning defeated to China, general Su was apointed the Emper­
or's special envoy to Liangchow, to pacify the troublesome barbarians
in that border area, but died soon after taking up his duties. The
Emperor mourned his death and conferred on him the posthumous
titles of Left Cavalry Marshal and Military governor of Yaochow.
(Ilyon says this last paragraph was taken from the official T'ang
history.)
Previous to this, a Tang army had been sent under general Su to
attack Koguryo a second time, and had pitched its tents on the out­
- 8 6­Wonder 1
skirts of P'yonyang. A courier was sent to Silla with a request for
food supplies.
This posed something of a problem. The supplies, if sent, would
have to pass through Koguryo territory, and thus there was a risk of
their being captured by the enemy. Not sending them, on the other
hand, would be abandoning an ally in his hour of need. Kim Yu-sin
volunteered to take charge of the transport and managed to reach the
Chinese camp with 20,000 bushels of grain under heavy guard.
Sometime later Kim Yu-sin dispatched two messengers to generai
Su, asking if his army should join the T'ang forces in an allied attack
on Koguryo. In return he received a drawing by the T'ang commander
of a calf and a young phoenix. This was a puzzle, and the great monk
Wonhyo was asked to interpret it. He said that both young creatures
had lost their mothers, and that this meant the Silla forces operating
in Koguryo were in danger and should be pulled back at once to rejoin
their "paren!."
Kim Yu-sin ordered his troops to cross the Pai River (now Tae­
dong-gang) and go north as fast as possible. But while the crossing was
in progress Koguryo troops attacked them from behind, and thousands
were killed. Kim Yu-sin launched a counterattack the following day
and slaughtered many Koguryo warriors.
An old Silla book contains the following account. "In the fifth year
of King Munmu (665) in the eighth moon, the King (of SiIla) led a
large army to the fortress of Ungjin, where he met with Prince Yung.
the (Tang) puppet ruler of Puyo. The two sovereigns built an altar
and killed a white horse as a sacrifice to the heavenly gods and guardian
deities of mountains and rivers. Then they paintliid their mouths with
the blood of the sacrifice as a symbol of their pledge of friendship.
(A very ancient custom is here recorded.) Next they read aloud the
following oath. (The oath is interesting evidence of the typical Chinese
assumption that because of her superior civiljzation China was by right
the ruler of all other states' and that political virtue consisted chiefly
in submission to the will of the Emperor.)
" 'The kings of Paekje hitherto have taken a vacillating course in
-81­

Samguk Yusa
their foreign relations and have neglected good neighborliness with
Silla. Instead of maintaining amity in accordance with the royal mar­
riage tie (there had been marriages between the Silla and Paekje royal
houses) they allied themselves with Koguryo and Japan in order to
commit repeated acts of brutality, raping the fair land and .massacring
the innocent inhabitants of Silla.
" 'The Celestial Emperor of the Middle Kingdom (China), mind­
ful of the welfare of these calamity-stricken people, dispatched celestial
envoys to the scene of conflict to make peace. Nevertheless Paekje,
relying on her remoteness and her fortifications, disdained the Celestial
Emperor's command, thus provoking him to send out an army to
subjugate the rebels.
" 'The palaces of Paekje ought to be demolished and ponds dug
in their ruins as an example to posterity. 'Embrace the meek and punish
the rebel' was the splendid practice of our imperial ancestors; 'Raise
the vanquished and heal the broken' was the benvolent rule of our
predecessors, whose noble virtues should be copied to add new luster
to the royal chronicles. Thus the Emperor made Yung ofPuyo, ex-king
of Paekje, governor of Ungjin to worship the shrines of his ancestors
and rule his native land.
" 'We command Prince Yung to rely upon SiJla as an ally and
friend, to dispel the old enmity and create new bonds of amity and
lasting peace between the two countries in order that they may become
our loyal vassals. We hereby send our right guard general Liu Jen-yuan
to convey our wish that marriages be contracted between the two royal
houses, and that the two kings paint their mouths with the blood of a
white horse in token of their pledge to share their joys and sorrows
and relieve each other's calamities like brothers.
" 'This our command is to be inscribed on an iron plate in letters
of gold and permanently displayed as a symbol of royal loyalty to the
imperial throne. If either of you disobeys our command and attacks
the other, the spirits of heaven will look down upon your rebellion and
send hundreds of catastrophes upon you, so that you will forfeit the
privileges of raising your children, ruling your native land and worship­
-88­Wonder I
ping your ancestors.'
"This the Celestial Emperor commanded Prince Yung of Puyo,.
and he now obeys. In witness whereof our solemn vow is inscribed in
letters of gold on this iron plate and placed in the royal shrine (of
SilIa) for our posterity to ten thousand generations to know and keep
our pledge and never to violate it. We pray the gods of heaven and earth
to drink this divine blood, to partake of the sacrifice and to give us
blessings."
After the ceremony the gifts for the gods were buried on the
northern side of the altar and the oath was inscribed in golden letters
on an iron plate and placed in the (Silia) royal shrine. The oath was
drafted by Liu Jen-kuei, military governor of Taebang (Le. northern
Paekje).
The official chronicle of the T'ang dynasty states that King Uija
and Crown Prince Yung were sent to the Chinese capital by general
Su Ting-fang. This oath is clear evidence that the Emperor released
Prince Yung and sent him back to rule Paekje in the Chinese behalf.
An old Paekje book states that King Uija with his concubines and
court ladies leaped from a great cliff north of Puyo into the river rather
than be captured by the victorious enemy, so that the people call it the
Rock of FaIling Deaths. But this is a mistake. Only the court ladies
leaped from the rock, while King Uija died in China as we have seen.
(There is indeed a sheer cliff on the bank ofthe White Horse River
near Puyo,from which the Paekje court ladies are reputed to have leaped
when the city was taken. It is known today as the· Rf!ck of the Falling
Flowers.)
A legend from Silla times says that after the\qestruction ofPaekje
and Koguryo Chinese forces remained in the Sangju area awaiting an
opportunity to attack Silla and bring the whole peninsula under
Chinese rule. Kim Yu-sin, the legend says, forestalled this plot by in­
viting the Chinese soldiers to a great banquet and feeding them poison­
ed birds' meat. The dead were then buried under a huge mound of
earth. Even today there is a mound ne;'u the T'ang bridge in Sangju
county northwest of Kyongju which it is claimed is the grave of the
-89­

Samgilk Yusa
poisoned T'ang soldiers.
But the official T'ang chronicles contain no mention of this in­
cident, either to conceal it or because the legend is groundless. More­
'Over, had this poisoning occurred. at the time stated in the legend, Silla
could hardly have asked the T'ang court for help in a later conflict
with Kogury~. It seems, therefore, that this Silla folk-tale has no basis
in fact. It is true that Silla took possession of Koguryo territory after
the battle of Mlljin (668) and was never subjugated to China, but
there is no evidence. of a murder of Chinese troops.
Following the defeat of Paekje and the withdrawal of Chinese
troops the King of Silla sent an army to conduct mopping-up oper­
ations. No sooner had they: taken up positions in Hansan Fortress,
however, then they were completely surrounded by forces from
Koguryo and Malgal (a Manchurian group ruled by Koguryo). Fierce
battles ensued, and by the time the siege had endured for forty days
the situation of the Silla troops seemed hopeless. .
In consternation, the King ofSilla called his courtiers together to
ask for their advice, but they all hung their heads in silent resignation.
But general Kim Yu-sin atose in the royal conference and said to the
King, "Your Majesty, this is too great a crisis to be warded off by
human strength alone. Only a miracle can bring succor to our men."
So saying he climbe.d :up Songbu-san (Star-floating Mountain)
where he built an altar and prayed. for a miracle from heaven. Suddenly
a huge fireball appeared above the altar and flew toward the north
shooting flames. Just as the enemy were about to attack the exhausted
troops in the lonely fortress, it changed into lightning and struck their
stone-shooting cannons .. (The existence of cannons in the seventh
century seems hardly likely; Perhaps they were catapults.) With thund­
erous sounds it smashed. bows, arrows; spears and projectiles, knocking
many of the enemy troops .to the ground. Those who survived this
heavenly bombing scattered and fled in all directions, and the Silla
troops were saved. Thisis the reason the place is named Star-floating
Mountain, for the fireball floated above it like a fiery star.
There is anothel1 story: about the Star-floating Mountain which
---() 0.­Wonder 1
has nothing to do with the fireball. It seems there was once a foolish
old man who planned to become an aristocrat overnight by obtair:itlg
a government position through some marvellous trick. He sent his son
to the top of a high mountain near the capital every night and in­
structed him to lift a flaming torch in the air at midnight. The people
of Kyongju thought that it was a fire-star of war floating low in the sky,
foretelling a national calamity.
The KiIig also saw it, and ordered the people to pray to heaven
for the removal of this evil omen which had appeared almost over his
palace, offering a big reward to anyone who could make it go away.
Then the foolish old man came forward and said that he could do it.
But the royal astrologer said to the King, "Your Majesty, this is not
a sign of national calamity but of private disaster, foretelling a son's
tragic death and a father's lamentation." ~o the King decided to take
no further action for the moment but to wait and see. Sure enough, the
very next morning as the old man's son was climbing down the moun­
tain he was caught and killed by a tiger.
During the reign of King Sinmun (68 I -692) the Tang Emperor
Kao-tsung sent 'an envoy to the Silla court with the following message:
"Our august father, because of his unification of the Celestial Empire
during his lifetime in harmony with the universal ',irtues and by the
merits of wise ministers such as Wei Cheng and Li Shun-feng, who
assisted the throne so well, was honored with the title T'ai-tsung (pro­
nounced T'aejong in Korean). Silla is a small nation outside Chi.na and
giving your former King (Muryol) the same posthumous title as a
Chinese Emperor is presumptuous and disloyal. We command you to
change this royal title at once." \
The King of Silla sent a polite reply to the Emperor as follows:
"Though Sma is a small nation, her King was able to unify the three
kingdoms during his lifetime by the merit of Kim Yu-sin, who assisted
the throne with unexcelled valor. ThereforeJhe King was honored with
the title T'aejong." .
When the Emperor read this letter he recalled havi,ng heard a
wondrous voice from heaven before his accession, saying that one of
-.9 J,­

Samguk Yusa
the great men in the thirty-three heavens was born in Silla and was
called Yu-sin. He could not help admiring the great warrior and sent
a second message to the court at Kyongju, which read "Do not bother
to change the royal title T'ai-tsung. Itis too good a name to change.­
from the T'ang Emperor."
Tradition says that when King Muryal ascended the throne (654) a
countryman presented to him as a congratulatory gift a pig with one
head, two bodies and eight legs. A wise man in the court interpreted
this as an omen that the King would annex all the territory in the
eight directions under heaven.
The Silla royal custom of wearing T'ang court robes and carrying
an ivory scepter in T'ang fashion began with King Muryol, for whom
the famous monk Chajang brought them back from China.
35. Changch'un-nang and P'arang
At the battle of Hwang-san (now Yonsan) between the armies of
Silla and Paekje, two SiIIa Hwarang named Changch'un-nang and
P'arang were killed. When King Muryol attacked Paekje in a later
battle, the two youths appeared to him in a dream and said, "We
offered our lives for king and country in a former battle. Though we
are now only pale ghosts, we wish to join Your Majesty's army to
defend the fatherland forever, but, being overshadowed by Su Ting­
fang, the T'ang general, we have to follow behind him all the time.
We beg you to give us a small unit of crack troops so that we may
attack the enemy and fight for a swift victory."
The King was deeply moved by their patriotic spirit even in death.
He ordered a memorial service to be held in a pavilion called
Mosan-jong, with a solemn Buddhist rite and erected Chang-iii
Temple in Puk-Hansanju (near modern Seoul) to the memory of
their gallant souls. (The ruins of this temple are still to be seen
outside Ch'ang-iii Mun (gate of righteousness) in t~e old city walls I
to the northwest of Seoul.) -J

'52. King Kyongmyong (917-924)
During the reign of King Kyongmy<5ng the fifty-fourth sovereign
the dogs in the mural painting at the Temple of the Four Deva Kings
began to whine mournfully. The monks chanted scriptures for three
days, until the dogs stopped, but after a time they again whined for
half a day. In February of 920 the shadow of the pagoda at Hwang­
nyong Temple appeared upside down on the grounds of the house of
Kilmmo-saji and in October of the same year the strings of the bows
held in the hands of the gods of the five directions at the Temple of the
Four Deva Kings were mysteriously cut away and the dogs in the mural
painting rushed out into the temple courtyard and back into the pic­
ture again.
53. King Kyong'ae (924-927)
The fifty-fifth sovereign was King Kyong'ae. In the first year of
his reign, on the 19th of February, the King held a Buddhist seminar
at Hwangnyong Temple, and entertained 300 monks of the "Son"
sect at a banquet. This was the beginning of the Hundred Seat
Preaching of the Son sect. (The practice became a daily one. "Son"
is more familiar to Western readers under its Japanese name, "Zen".) r 54. King Kyongsun (927-935, the last king)
The fifty-sixth sovereign of Silla was Kim Pu, the Great King,
whose posthumous title is Ky6ngsun. In the year 926, during the reign
ofhis predecessor King Ky6ng'ae, Chin Hwon, the tiger-spirited general
of Later Paekje invaded SilIa, attacking Koul-pu. King Kyl5ng'ae sent
a request for military aid to Wang Kon, the King of Koryo. but before
the troops could arrive Chin Hwon led an attack on Kyongju and took
the city.
King Kyong'ae had been enjoying a party with his Queen and court
-132 -Wonrier 2
ladies, merrily drinking, singing and dancing. When the rebel soldiers
entered the city the King and Queen hid themselves in the inner palace,
while the attendant nobles and their wives scattered in all directions.
prostrating themselves before the victorious enemy and offering to
be slaves if only their lives were spared.
Chin Hwon set up his headquarters in the royal palace and ordered
his men to plunder both public and private treasures. He forced the
King to fall on his own sword, violated the Queen and loosed his.
soldiers upon the court ladies and the King's concubines. After these
outrages he chose Kim Pu, a distant cousin of King Kyong'ae, placed
him on the throne, and withdrew from Kyongju in triumph, carrying
off hundreds of aristocrats and pretty women together with precious
jewels from the palace.
No sooner had the new King emerged from his coronation than
he changed his dragon robe for mourning clothes and his royal crown
for a hempen hat. Then he ordered that the body of King Kyong'ae
lie in state in the West Palace, where he wailed loudly with his courtiers.
The King of Koryl5 in Songdo (Kaesong) dispatched a special
envoy to Kyongju to convey his condolence and deep sympathy. In
March ofthe following year he visited Kyongju in person, accompa.nied
by fifty horsemen. King Kyongsun and his court came to the outskirts
of the city to greet him, and invited him to a welcoming banquet at
lmhae Pavilion.
After the formalities had been observed King Kyongsiln shed tears.
as he told his noble visitor of Chin Hwon's savage raid and the falling
fortunes of Silla. In tears himself, the King of Koryo comforted his
royal host, and extended his visit for ten days before returning home.
During his stay in Kyongju his soldiers behaved Iik"e gentlemen and not
one of them violated military discipline or committed lawless acts.
The people of Silla-men and women, boys and girls-congratulated
each other, comparing Chin Hwon to a man-eating tiger and Wang
Kon to an affectionate father.
On the day of the mid-autumn moon festival the King of Koryo
sent an envoy to the Silla court with an embroidered brocade robe and
-133 ­

Samguk Yusa
a saddle for the King and gifts for all the nobles and generals accord-,
ing to their rank.
By October of the year 935 most of the territory of Sma was
occupied by rebels, and there were more uprisings daiJy. The country­
side was infested with bandits, the royal troops had lost the martial
Hwarang spirit, and famine stalked the land. It seemed to the King that
there was no end to his troubles and that his decayed kingdom, despite
its glorious history ofa thousand years, might collapse at any moment.
In desperation His Majesty called a royal conference of his highest
officials and said to them, "We are met to discuss a very grave matter.
Should we surrender to Wang Kon and cede to this kind-hearted
neighboring monarch our sovereignty over Sma or should we continue
to fight the fierce wardogs at home and prepare for a final battle for
supremacy with Wang K<:in, which it seems to me would mean the total
destruction of Silla ?"
Opinions were divided and there was considerable argument. The
Crown Prince wished to fight to the end. "The rise or fall of a nation
depends on the will of Heaven," he said. "We must rally all loyal sub­
jects and patriotic soldiers to defend the fatherland with all our strength,
of one mind with our people till the last minute. Why should we give
up without a fight? How can we so easily surrender our thousand-year­
old country to a neighbor?"
"Silla is now helpless and we cannot hold out any longer," the
King replied. "If we are neither ,strong nor weak, we will be caught in
the middle. It is unbearable to see thousands of good people suffering
tragic deaths in a losing war. Rather, we must lose face and surrender
peacefully to save the people from great catastrophe. Kim Pong-hyu,
my loyal minister! Go and present my official letter of voluntary sur­
render to the King of Koryo. All is over."
"Ah, sad day!" said the Crown Prince, weeping bitterly. "Farewell,
King and kingdom! I am going to Kaegol-san (the Diamond Moun­
tains)" So the young prince departed and entered a deep, rocky valley
under Pirobong, the highest peak in the range. There he dressed himself
in hemp and fed on grass roots, and rallied the loyal sons of the Hwa­
134 ­Wonder 2
rang to fight Wang Kon.
The King's youngest son shaved his head and became a monk of
the Hwaom sect with the religious name Pomgong, residing at Popsu
and Haein temples during the rest of his life.
Wang Kon, the King ofKoryo, when he received the letter of sur­
render, immediately dispatched his first minister of state Wang Ch'al
to Kyongju with orders to conduct King Kyongsun and his entourage
to Songdo (Kaesong) with an honor guard. The King accordingly set
out for Songdo accompanied by the civil and military officials of his
court. The long procession of carriages and carts laden with royal
treasures stretched over ten miles ofthe highway, which was lined from
Kyongju to Songdo with vast throngs of spectators.
Wang Kon came to the outskirts of his capital to meet the royal
procession from Silla. He celebrated the day with a great feast on Man­
wol-dae (Full Moon Hill) and gave his eldest daughter, the Princess
ofNangnang, to the surrendered Silla king in marriage. He reconfirmed
his title as King and promoted him to the highest position in the Koryo
court, ranking above even the Crown Prince. Moreover, Wang Kon
granted the Silla King an annual allowance of one thousand large bags
of rice and gave him the old Silla territory (which he called Kyongju)
as his fief.
The alliance between the two royal houses was further cemented
when King Kyongsun gave the beautiful daughter ofhis uncle to Wang
Kon as his wife. (This uncle, Ilyon says, was Ok-nyom, younger
brother of the King's father Hyojong-Kakkan. This was" Queen
Sinsong.)
However, according to the royal family trre prepared by Kim
Kwan-ui during the Koyri:S dyansty, Queen SinSQng was of the Yi
family and Wang Kon married her during a trip to Hapju county, of
which Yi ChOng-on, a Kyongju nobleman, was magistrate. She bore
the King a son who was known as Anjong. The day ofher death was the
25th of March and her tom~ was called Ch'ong-nung, where a temple,
Hyonhwa-sa. was erected in her memory. ~mongthe twenty-five queens
and concubines of the King, no woman of the Kim family is recorded
-135 ­

Samguk Yusa
in the royal chronicle, but the annalist does record that Prince Anjong.
was a grandson (on the maternal side) of Silla.
Wang K6n's grandson Sin (King Kyongjong, 975-981) married
King Ky6ngsun's daughter.
When King Ky6ngsun died in 978, his old royal title was again
conferred upon him together with the title Sang-pu (royal father-in­
law). King Kyongjong issued a royal decree as follows:
"Know ye, my loyal subjects: When Chou of the Chi family
founded a new kingdom he first invested Lu Wang with an honorary
title and when Han of the Uti family rose to power he first invested
Su Ho with an honorary title. Hence the royal glory shone far and wide
over all the world and the happiness of the royal household bloomed
for thirty generations of the Dragon Picture and four hundred years
of the Giraffe-Hooves, bright as the sun and moon, coeval with heaven
and earth. This institution began with a ruler assisted by his wise
ministers.
(The allusions here are to the Chou and Han dynasties of ancient
China. The reader will recall the dragon with a picture Oil its back de­
scribed in the prologue as the portent of a great king. "Giraffe Hooves" .
is the title ofa section of the Confucian Book ofOdes, but is here used
to allude to the Han dynast)'. which did indeed endure for about 40().
years.}
"Kim Pu, King of Nangnang, who is endowed with a fief of 8,000.
households, hereditarily residing jn Kerim (Sill a), and honored with
a royal title, possessed eminently noble qualities and was gifted with
fine literary talent.
"Looking forward to greater happiness, he lived comfortably in
his fief with a Military Strategy (a well-known Chinese work on this
subject is here alluded to) in his bosom. The founder of our kingdom,
having bound the two royal families in friendly ties, gave him a
daughter in marriage. Now the two kingdoms are united and the new
state ruling over the Three Hans prospers anew daily, with one pa­
triotic mind from the throne to the plough. .
"I hereby confer on him the title of Royal Father-in-Jaw and
-136­Wonder 2
increase his fief to 10,000 households in consideration of his loyal and
meritorious services to the state. I command you, all competent officials
to execute my orders with due ceremony."
"The 10th month of the 8th year of Kaipao
(Royal Sign Manual, Royal Seal)
Countersigned by Yung-son
His Majesty's President
of the Privy Council
and His Majesty's Cabinet Ministers."
According to 'Saron' the progenitors of the Pak and Sok clans of
Silla were born of eggs, while that of the Kim clan was found in a
golden box which' descended from heaven on a golden chariot. But
these stories are too fantastic to believe, although they have traditional­
ly been accepted by the populace as facts. The early Silla rulers were
frugal in their personal lives and generous to others. They maintained
few government offices and observed the annual rites gjmply. They
sent tribute to and received envoys from the Middle Kingdom across
the sea, and dispatched youths to study in that kingdom, thereby to
cultivate decorum in their nation through the influence of the refined
customs and advanced culture taught by the ancient sages. Moreover,
with the aid of the military might of the Imperial Tang army Silla
subjugated Paekje :md Koguryo, making them provinces under her
single rule in her days of greatness.
However, due to the evils ofBuddhism. pagodas and temples lined
the streets and the common people deserted their farms to become
monks and nuns,. The morale of the army fell into decay, calling down
rebellion and destruction upon the nation. King 'Kyong'ae gave him­
self up to merriment and soft pleasures. He revelled at the Pavilion of
the Stone Abalone with his choicest beauties and flattering courtiers,
unaware of his doom until Chin Hwon, like Han Ch'in-hu, sprang at
his throat, and his Queen f~1I prey to Hwon, like Chang li-hua. (The
King and Queen are compared to figur~s in Chinese history.)

because his kingdom was in extremities, but his decision was neverthe­
less praiseworthy. Had he chosen to fight on until the end the royal
Kim clan would have been exterminated and a great catastrophe would
have fallen upon his innocent people. His cession of sovereignty over
his kingdom, sealing his royal treasure vaults without awaiting the
King's orders, was an act not only of obeisance to our King but of
mercy to myriads of living creatures. In the olden days Su Tzu-chen
praised Chen-shih as a loyal vassal for surrendering Wu and Yueh to
Sung, but the virtue of the Silla King outshines that of Chen-shih.
(Yet another Chinese precedent is cited here.)
Thefounderofthe Koryo dynasty had many queens and concubines
who bore him many children, but ever since King Hyonjong ascended
the throne (l009) as the maternal grandson of Silla royalty the succes­
sive Koryo Kings have been his descendants, with the royal throne
transmitted in an unbroken line thanks to the charity ofKing Kyongsun.
When Silla fell and the old land passed under tlie rule of a new
dynasty, Agan-Sinhoe, a noble-hearted Silla courtier, withdrew from
official life and returned to his native place in Kyongju. Seeing the
desolate condition of the ruined capital he recited the old poem Shu
Li-Ji (The Millet Hangs its Head, a poem from the Book ofOdes about
a ruined palace which had been turned into a millet-field). His heart sank
with grief and he wept when he sa,,': the millet heads and wild grass
tossing among the ruins of the Sillapalace. He composed a song about
the fall of Silla but unfortunatel~ it has been lost.
(This whole last passage, following the decree, has a decidedly
Confucian tone. Its rejection ofthe old legends and its blaming Buddhism
for the fall of Silla are quite unlike Jlyon in other parts of the book.)
55. South Puyo, Early Paekje and l'i"orth Puyo
Puyo-gun(county) was the capital of early Paekje, According to
the Samguk Sagi, in the spring of the twenty-sixth year of King Song
of Paekje (548) the King moved his court to Saja (or Sabi), calling his
kingdom Nam (south) Puyo. (Saja or Sabi was another name for Soburi.
-138­Wonder 2
now Kos()ngjin.)
In the (Kory1S) land survey it is registered as Ch1Snj1Sng Chuch'op
in Soburi-gun and the present Puyo-gun has had its old name restored
in honor of the name of the Paekje royal family, Pu. Puyo was
also called yoju. To the west of Puyo is a temple called Chapok-sa
on whose curtains the following is embroidered in Chinese characters:
"The Great Temple of Merit in Yoju, May, 15th year of Tung-huo,
year of the chicken (Chong-yu)." An old document of the magistrate
of Hanam-Imju says that Imju is now Karim-gun and Yoju is now
Puyo-gun
In the Paichi Tili-chih it is written (quoting the Hou Han-shu),
"Paichi (Paekje) is one of the seventy-eight states of the three Han
nations." The Pei-shih says, "Paichi (Paekje) is bounded on the east
by Silla, on the southwest by the Great Sea and on the north by the Han
River. Its capital was in Kobal-song, also called Koma-song and
Obang-song." (The suffix "song" means "fortress.")
The Tung-tien states, "Paichi (Paekje) adjoins Silla 011 the south,
Koguryo on the north, and faces the Great Sea to the west." The Chiu
Tang-shu says, "Paichi (Paekje) is another name for Puyo. On its
northeast is Silla, on its south and west are Wo (Japan) and Yuehchow
across the sea, and on its north is Koguryo. The King's palaces are
surrounded by two city walls on the east and west" The Hsin Tang­
shu also says Paekje is bounded on the south and west by Wo (Japan)
and Yuehchow across the sea and on the north by Koguryo. According
to the Samguk Sagi the royal founder of Paekje was Onjo, whose father
was King Ch'umo, also called Chumong.
When Chumong the good bowman escaped Sfuthward from Puk­
puyo to Cholbon-Puyo, the king ofthat land, who had three daughters
but no son, found Chumong a great hero and gave him his second
daughter in marriage. When the King died soon after, Chumong
succeeded to the throne. Two sons-Pullyu and Onjo-were born to
him by this queen. "
These two sons were afraid of Yuri" the crown prince, and fled
southward with ten courtiers including Ogan and Maryo. On'reaching
-139 ­

Samguk Yusa
year of Tai-yuan of Tsin Hsiao Wu-ti, he took ten copies of Buddhist
scriptures to Liaotung, where he preached Buddhism and won many
converts. This was the beginning of Buddhism in Koguryo. (Parts of
the Liaotung peninsula were at various times included in Koguryo.)
In the first year of l-hsi (405) T'an-shih returned to Kuan-chung
and preached the gospel of Buddha to the people of Changan and its
environs. T'anshih's snowy feet were whiter than his snowy face, so
the people called him tbe white-footed monk. His feet never got wet,
even when he waded across muddy streams.
In the closing days of the Tsin dynasty a fierce leader of the north­
ern Hsiung-nu named Ho-lien Po-po led his barbarian army into
Kuan-chung from the north, massacring the inhabitants in countless
numbers. (The Hsiung-nu were a major group of nomadic tribes in
north Asia who plagued China for centuries.) Ho-lien Po-po stabbed
T'an-shih through and through with his spear, but the strange monk
remained unrufiled, repelling every thrust with a laugh, and not
taking the least harm. The barbarian admired his superhuman powers
and saved the lives of all his fellow monks. T'anshih fled through
woods and swamps, undergoing all sorts of ordeals as he traveled in
the habit of a mendicant.
When T'o Pa-tao, a general in revolt against the reigning monarch,
recaptured Changan from the Hsiung-nu and seized control of the
state there lived in Poling a man named Tsui Ho who worshipped
paganism (Taoism is intended here), hating Buddhism with a deep
hatred. When T'o Pa-tao appointe'd him prime minister he immediately
persuaded the usurper to persecute the followers of Buddha, con­
demning them as inimical to the state and interfering with the daily
lives of the people. K'ou Chien-chih, who called himself a "Heavenly
Teacher of Taoism," abetted him in this.
On New Year's Day in the last year of Tap'ing, T'an-shih appeared
at the palace gate and asked for an audience with T'o Pa-tao in order
to convert him to Buddhism. The usurper became angry and ordered
his soldiers to cut off the head of the bold monk. The men struck at
his neck with their long scimitars and blue dragon swords, but the
-184­Rise of Buddhism
blades rebounded without doing the least injury to T'an-shih. In a·
towering passion, T'o Pa-tao himself swung his great battleaxe, but to
no avail. Finally they threw the monk into a garden where a pet tiger
was kept, but the tiger simply ignored him.
To Pa-tao at last realized that the monk was under the protection
of Buddha. He was confined to his bed with a high fever, while T'sui
Ho and K'ou Chieu'chih were stricken with pestilence. As soon as he
could, To struck off the heads of T'sui and K'ou and destroyed their
families, asserting that they had caused him to fall into the grave crime
of persecuting a monk.
To Pa-tao repented his sins and issued a decree granting freedom
of Buddhist belief to the people throughout his domain. The account
breaks off at this point, and there is no record of the later days of T'an­
shih.
According to this account Tan-shih came to the East in the last
year of Tai-yuan and returned to Kuan-chung in the first year of l-hsi,
so he lived in the eastern lalld for ten years, although this fact is not
recorded in the Tung-shih. The miracles he worked are similar to those
of Ado, Mukhoja and Marananta at about the same period, so it is
possible that "Tan-shih" is a pseudonym of one of these.

PopMng (527), Ech'adon, a petty official of the court, "immolated

himself for the sake of Buddha. This event occurred in the eighth year
()f Pao-tung of Hsiao-Liang Wu-ti, when Dharma arrived in Chinling
(Nanking) from West Ch'<snch'uk (India) and Nangji P6psa the high
priest first opened a lecture hall on Mt. Y6ngch'u to preach Bud­
dhism.
During the years of Yuan-huo of T'ang Hsien-tsung (806-820).
Ilnyom, a monk at Namgan Temple, wrote a eulogy of Ech'adon's
martyrdom for Buddha which may be summarized as follows.
When King Pophting was seated on his throne in the Purple
Palace one day, he looked out over his domain in this eastern land
and said, "The Han Emperor Ming-ti received a revelation from
Buddha in a dream before the :flow of Buddhist teaching to the East. I
wish to build a sanctuary in which all my people can wash away their
sins and receive eternai blessings."
His courtiers did not understand the inner significance of the
King's words, and so his desire to build a Buddhist temple went
unfulfilled. The King sighed deeply and said, "Because of my lack of
virtue heaven and earth show no harmonious signs and my people
enjoy no real happiness. I am therefore minded to turn to Buddhism
for the peace of my heart, but there is no one who can assist me."
There was in the court a minor official of the rank of Sa-in. His
family name was Pak and his nickname was Ech'adon, or Y6mch'ok,
a pun for porcupine. Although his father was undistinguished, his
grandfather had held the rank of Ajinjong (fourth of the seventeen
court grades of SilIa) and his great-grandfather Sl1ppo Ka!mun-wang
(Kalmun-wang is a title bestowed on the father of a reigning king,
similar to that of Hilngson Taewongun, father of King Kojong, during
the Yi dynasty).
In the Biography of Ado the Monk compiled by Kim Yong-haeng
it is written, " ... By that time Yomch'ok was twenty-six years old.
His father was Kit-sung, his grandfather was Kong-han and his
great-grandfather was K<Slhae-wang."
The great-grandson of a noble king who had performed virtuous
deeds, Yomch'ok's steadfast loyal heart was like a straight bamboo
-186 ­Rise of Buddhism
or an evergreen pine tree and his morals were as clear as a water­
mirror. He was thus. a ,likely candidate for promotion to high office
in the court of the clear river4 to attend the King.
(When he heard of the King's desire to build a temple) the young
official took courage. He looked upon the King's face and said in a
dignified tone, "The sages of old would lend their ears even to men of
low degree if they gave wise counsel. Since I know Your Majesty's
mind, I will dare to say a few words. As the song of birds heralds the
approach ofspring, so the gush ofblood from my neck will foreshadow
the full bloom of Buddhism, for in my spouting blood the people will
see a miracle."
"For mercy's sake," cried the King, "that is not a thing for you
to do."
"A loyal subject will die for his country," Yomch'ok replied,
"and a righteous man will die for his king. If you cut off my head
immediately for disobeying your orders to erect a temple as an example
to the stubborn courtiers, who will never believe in Buddha unless
they are shown a miracle, the myriad people will prostrate themselves
before your throne and will worship Buddha."
"A great and merciful being," the King said, "will cut his own
:flesh and shed his own blood to atone for the sin' of the myriad
creatures. He will sacrifice his own life even for the sake of the birds
of the air and beasts in the slaughterhouse. Though I desire to save
my people, how can I kill an innocent man like you? You would do
better to avoid this fate."
Y6mch'ok remained steadfast. "One man's earthly life is dear,"
he said, "but the eternal lives of many people are dearer. If I vanish
\with the morning dew today, the life-giving Buddhist faith will rise
with the blazing sun tomorrow. This will bring peace to your heart."
Finally the King assented. "The chick of the phoenix, though
young, desires to :fly into the high heavens. The chick of the ibis, from
its hatching, wishes to swiI!l in the strong'waves. If you have set your
heart on advancing the spread of Buddhism by the sacrifice of your
life, you are a great man." .

After this conversation with Yomch'ok the King called the,
courtiers into a royal conference and solemnly declared to them, "I
wished to build a Buddhist temple in order to share peace ofmind with
all my loyal subjects, but you are too headstrong to execute my orders.
I will put you to the rack."
All the courtiers trembled from head to foot. White with rage,
the King roared at Yomch'ok, "You too hindered my orders and
miscarried my messages. Your crime is unpardonable and you shall
die. You shave your head and wear a long robe, you utter strange
words-'Buddha is mystery, Buddhism gives life.' Now let your
Buddha perform a miracle and save your life." (This would seem to
indicate that Yomch'ok had actually become a monk, a fact not
indicated in the foregoing.)
On the day appointed for Yomch'ok's death the executioner lifted
his great sword above the young monk's head. The. King, courtiers
and citizens who had gathered to witness the execution aU averted
their eyes, for they dared not look on the horrible sight. Looking up
to heaven Yomch'ok said "I die happy for the sake of Buddha. ]f
Buddha is worth believing in, let there be a wonder after my death."
Down came the sword on the monk's neck, and up flew his head
spouting blood as white as milk. Suddenly dark clouds covered the sky,
rain poured down and there was thunder and lightning. Fish leaped
from the depths of the streams and flapped in the air, frightened
monkeys jumped and shrieked .as the trees swayed in the whistling
wind, tigers ran and dragons flew, ghosts mourned and goblins wept.
It seemed that heaven and earth had turned upside down. From afar
came the sound ofa bell as the goddess ofmercy welcomed the martyr's
fragrant soul into the Lotus Paradise.
Hot tears rolled down the King's dragon robe and cold sweat
wet the courtiers to the hone. Yomch'ok's childhood friends clung to
his casket and wailed as if they had lost their parents. In tears, the
onlookers praised him, saying that his glorious death outshone the
heroic deeds of Kaijach'u and Hong-yon in old China.s They admired
him as an immortal saint for his self-sacrificing support of the King's
188 ­Rise of Buddhism
faith in Buddhism and for the completion of the missionary task of
Ado.
They buried his headless body on the western peak of North
Mountain (Ki1mgang-san) in the Diamond Mountains, which were
named for the Diamond Sutra, one of the Buddhist scriptures, and
erected a temple in his memory called Chach'u-sa. Legend says his
body was buried in the place where his flying head had fallen.
In the fifth year of King Chinhung (544) the King erected Hung­
nyun-sa as one of the cardinal temples of Kyongju where his people
might worship Buddha. According to the Samguk Sagi and local tales,
the construction of this temple had actually begun in the fourteenth
year of King Pophi1ng's reign (527). In the twenty-first year of this
King's reign huge trees were cut down in Ch'onkyong-nim (Heaven
Mirror Forest) and fashioned into magnificent pillars and other parts
ofthe temple, which stood on large foundation stones, facing beautiful­
ly carved stone lanterns and pagodas in the courtyard.
In the first year of Ta-ch'ing of Liang Wu-ti the Liang Emperor's
envoy Shenhu brought a gift of Sari (Buddhist relics) and in the sixth
year of T'ien-chia of Chen Wen-ti the Chen Emperor's envoy Liu Szu
and the monk Ming-kuan brought Buddhist scriptures with them to
Silla. By that time in Kyongju and its environs the golden roofs of
temples glittered against the sky like the Milky Way and lotus-crowned
pagodas stood in unending lines like flights of wild geese. There were
bell-towers with Sanscrit-inscrihed bronze bells and Buddhist banners
flew from every housetop.
Strong, brave monks, like elephants on the land and dragons in
the sea carried the blessings of Buddhism to every corner of the land.
Living Bodhisattvas appeared, such as Chinna at 'Punhwang Temple,
Pogae at Pusok Temple and Odae at Naksan Temple, while celebrated
monks from the West (China) visited these temples. This heavenly
faith made the Three Hans one nation and their inhabitants one family,
with the name of Buddha written on the heavenly door and his merit
reflected in the Milky Way. Thus Budghism arose in Silla through
the grace of three sages-Ado, PophUng and Yomch'ok~(otherwise
-189 ­

Samguk Yusa
called Ech'adon).
Some years later leading Silla monks including Hyeryung, Hyo­
won, Nokp'ung, Chinno and Kumui repaired Yomch'ok's grave and
carved an elegy on him on his monument nearby.
On the fifteenth of the eighth moon in the twelfth year of Yuan­
huo, the ninth year of King H<5ndok (817), when Y<5ngsu-Sonsa, of
the Yuga sect, the chief priest of Hilngnyun-sa offered sacrifices at
Yomch'ok's grave, he organized his fellow monks into a prayer circle
and held a memorial service on the fifth of each month to pray for the
repose of Y<5mch'ok's soul. According to a local biography the elders
of Kyongju went to Hungnyun-sa early in the morning of the fifth
day of the eighth moon to offer sacrifices to Yomch'ok's soul and to
mark the day and hour of his martyrdom.
The rise of Buddhism in Silla was brought about by the harmoni­
ous labors of King PophUng and Y<5mch'ok, who wer!'! like water and
fish in the kingdom of Buddha, as Liu Pei and Chu Koliang were during
the Ch'u-Han (Ch'ok-Han) working the wonders of a dragon in the
clouds.
When Hungnyun-sa was built, King Pophilng doffed his crown
and donned a monk's robe. He made temple slaves of his royal re­
latives and himself became chief priest of the temple. Later, during
the reign of King T'aejong (Muryol, 654-661), Prime Minister Kim
Yang-to became a devout Buddhist and sent his two daughters Hwapo
and Yonpo (Flower Jewel and Lotus Jewel) to be slaves of this temple.
The whole family of Moch'ok, a traitor, were also made temple slaves_
AU the descendants of these families remained slaves of Hungnyun-sa,
and to this day the slaves of that temple are called "royal children,"
Upon succeeding King Pophung to the throne, King Chinhung
immediately bestowed upon Hungnyun-sa a panel in the royal cal­
ligraphy bearing the Chinese inscription, "Great King's Temple of
Hungnyun." King Pophung's family name was Kim and his Buddhist
name was P<5pun or Popkong (Holy Cloud or Empty Spirit).
The Biographies of the Monks and various books of legends say
that King P<5phUng's Queen became a nun with the Buddhist name
-190 ­Rise of Bllddhism
popun. King Chinhung and his Queen also entered the order and
both took this same name, popun. Another book, Ch'aek-pu Won­
ku, says that King Pophung's family name was Mo and his given ,Iname Chin. In the year in whicll the construdion of Hungnyun-sa
began, King pophung's Queen founded a temple of her own called
yonghilng-sa. She shaved her head when her royal husband did
and became a nun, taking the religious name MyopoP (Holy Mystery),
and resided in the temple until she died a few years later.
The Samguk Sagi says that in the thirty-first year of King Chin­
p'yong (614) a Buddha image at Yonghung-sa fell down, and soon
afterward the nun who had been the consort of King ChinhUng passed
away. King Chinhilng was King pophung's nephew and his Queen
Sado Puin(pak-ssi) was a daughter of Yongsil Kakkan of Moryang-ni.
She also left her palace and became a nun, but she was not the builder
and mistress of yonghung-sa. It was King pophung's Queen Lady
Pado who built Yonghilng-sa, with Buddha images erected in its hall.
and she died there as a nun.
The Samguk Sagi makes a serious mistake in omitting the fact
that Kings P15phung and Chinhilng both renounced the throne to
become monks. It makes another mistake in the following passage.
"In the first year of Ta-t'ung, in the year of the goat (ChOng-mi) a
temple was erected in Ungch'onju called Tait'ong-sa (Temple of
Ta-t'ung) in honor of tile Liang Emperor in China." Ungch'on is noW
Kongju and was then part of Silla. s But this temple could not have
been erected in the year indicated, because at that time the erc;:ction of
Hungnyun-sa in Kyongju was in full swing, so that there were neither
time nor resources to work on another one. Perhaps Tait'ong-sa was
erected in the first year of Chung Ta-t'ung (529).\

63. King Pop Prohibits Killing
The twenty-ninth sovereign of Paekje was King PiSp. His child­
hood name was SiSn and he was also called Hyosun. ~e ascended the
throne in the tenth year of Kai-huang of Sui Wen-ti (599). In the winter
of that same year he promulgated a law prohibiting the taking of life
(in accordance with Buddhist belief) and commanding his people to
free falcons and destroy fishing tackle in private homes. In the following
year he ordained thirty new monks and began the construction of
Wanghilng Temple in his capital, Sajasong (Sabisong). Work had
hardly been finished on preparation of the site, however, when he
died, leaving completion of the task to his son King Mu, who finally
finished it in the thirty-fifth year of his reign.
This temple was also called Mirilk-sa (Temple of Maitreya
Buddha). Behind it stood a picturesque mountain like an embroidered
wind-screen, overlooking the silvery Saja River. The temple was a
scene of natural beauty in all seasons, with rare flowering plants and
awe-inspiring trees within its precincts. The King often sailed down
the river to visit the temple and admire its beauty.
This account is at variance with those given in old books oflegends,
which say that King Mu was born of a poor woman who had fallen
in love with a pond-dragon and that his childhood name was Sodong
(Potato Boy; see the account in Book Two under this name). After

~. Taoism and the Downfall of Koguryo
According to the KoryO Pon-gi, in the closing days of that
'kingdom, during the days of Wu-te and Chen-kuan (Tang Emperors
Kao-tsu and Tai-tsung, 618-649), the people of Kogury6 turned
'to the worship of Taoism, contributing five bushels of rice each to
'the priests. When the Tang Emperor Kao-tsu heard of this, he sent
,a Taoist priest to Koguryo with portraits of Lao Tzu to expound his
'Classic of Morality (probably the Tao Te Ching is intended here) to
'the people. Among those who listened to this priest was King Yong­
nyu of Koguryo, who had been on the throne for seven years, the
'date then being the seventh year of Wu-te (624). ,
In the following year the King sent an envoy to the Tang court
to seek; knowledge of Taoism and Buddhism and the Emperor (Kao­
tsu) granted his wish. \ After his coronation in the sixteenth year of Chen-yuan (642),
King pojang wished to see Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism
;flourish in harmony in his kingdom. Thereupon his prime minister
~Hapsomun (also called Kaesomun; full name Ch'iSn or YiSn Hapsomun
'Or Kaeso ) said, "Confucianism and Buddhism are popular among

Sainguk Yusa
Song of the Blind Child
I fall on my knees and clasp both my hands
To pray thee to have mercy on me, 0 Kwanum Bodhisattva!
Thou hast touched so many dark eyes with thy thousand hands
And made them bright as daylight;
Pray give me one eye for love and another for charity.
If thou givst me mine eyes, I will sing thy great mercy.
Song of Praise to the Goddess of Mercy
Riding a bamboo horse, playing an onion pipe.
I played on hills and streams.
But alas, in a twinkling I lost the sight of both eyes!
Had the goddess not given me back my bright eyes,
How many springs would have come and gone without my seeing
the pussy-willows!
The two Buddhas of Naksan and Chosin, the Lovesick Monk r~·
In the olden days, when Uisang Popsa had returned from his first
visit to China, he heard that the goddess of mercy (Kwanum) had taken
up her abode in a cave on the seacoast. He therefore called the place
Naksan, after the lndian mountain Pota-Nakka-san, which is better
known as So-Paekhwa (Small. White Flower) because the graceful
white-clad image of Kwanum Bodhisattva there resembled a white
flower on a slender stem.
(Uisang evidently went to this place for a religious retreat of some
sort). On the seventh day of his purification, Uisang stood up and
pushed his cushion into the sea so that it would float away on the
morning tide. Eight gods from the Four Deva Kings then ,conducted
him into the cave. There he looked up to heaven and worshipped
Buddha, and a crystal rosary was given to him. He took it, and as he
stepped backward the Dragon of the Eastern Sea offered him a bead­
like gem (Cintamani) , which he also accepted. Uisang purified himself
-244 1l 1
j
Pagodas and Buddhist Images
for a further seven days, after which he beheld the splendid face and
graceful figure of the living Buddha.
The Buddha said, "If you climb this mountain you will see a pair
of bamboos growing at the top. There build a palace for me." When
Uisang had left the presence of the Buddha he climbed the mountain,
and above the cave two bamboo plants shot suddenly outofthe ground
and then disappeared. Usiang therefore knew that this was the holy
abode of Buddha, and on this spot he built a temple called Naksan-sa
with a lifelike image of the graceful Buddha in its Golden Hall, where
he also deposited the crystal rosary before his departure.
Soon afterward Wonhyo, another famous Silla monk, made a
pilgrimage to worship this Buddha. When he arrived at the southern
foot ofthe mountain, he saw a woman harvesting rice in a field. Won­
hyo liked women and pleasantry, so he said to her jestingly, "Will you
give me some rice?"
"No, I am sorry, I cannot," she replied. "It is a lean year and
beggars are not welcome."
Proceeding further, he met a woman washing her menstrual band
in running water under a bridge. She too he addressed in jest: "Let
me have a drink of the cool water."
"All right, come and drink," rang out her clarion voic:e, and she
scooped up some of the unclean water in a half-moon-shaped gourd
and pressed it to his lips. Wonhyo drained the gourd and dipped more
water from the mountain stream to quench his thirst._,
As he did so, a blue bird in a pine tree nearby called to him "Come
on, my good monk Huiche-Hwasang!" and disappeared, leaving a
woman's shoe under the tree. When Won~yo reached the tempie he
found another shoe, of the same size and shape, by the pedestal of the
Kwanum Bodhisattva. He then realized that these shoes belonged to
the two women whom he had met, and that they were both incarnate
Buddhas. From that time on peopl~, called the pine from which the
bird had called the K:wanum pine. '
Wonhyo wished to enter the cave and see the gr~~eful figure of the
living Buddha there, but a storm was raging at sea and his little boat

almost capsized, so he was forced to desist.
Many years later Pomil, the founder of Kulsan Temple, traveled
to China in the years of T'ai-huo (827-835) and visited Kaikuo Temple
in Mingchow. There, occupying the lowest place in the temple, he met
a strange monk whose left ear was missing. This monk said to Pomil,
"I am one of your fellow countrymen. My home is in Tokki-pang,
Iknyong-hyon, on the boundary of Myongju (Yangyang in Kangwon
Province). When you return home, visit my native place and build a
house for me."
Pomil visited all the famous Chinese temples and learned much
esoteric Buddhist doctrine. When he returned home in the seventh year
ofT'ang Hui-ch'ang, the year of the hare (847) he founded Kulsan-sa.
On the night of the fifteenth of February in the twelfth year of T'ang
Ta-chung, in the year of the tiger (858), Pomil had a dream about the
one-eared monk whom he had met years before in China. The monk
stood under his bedroom window and said, "You made me a promise
at the temple in Mingchow. Why are you so late in keeping it?" In
great surprise Pomil arose and gathered a party of fellow monks to
seek the native place of the one-eared monk near Iknyong (Wing Pass).
In a village at the foot of Naksan he met a woman named Tokki
whose eight-year-old son was accustomed to play near a stone bridge
south of the village. One day the child said to her, "Mother, one of my
playmates has a face that shines with golden rays." The woman told this
to Pomi!, who in great joy took the child with him to the stone bridge.
Under the bridge in midstream he found a stone Buddha image. When
it was taken from the stream he saw that it exactly resembled the monk
he had met in China-its left ear was missing. This was the noble image
of Chongch'wi Bodhisattva. Pomil selected an auspicious site on Nak­
san and built a temple, enshrining the holy image in its Golden Hall.
(llyon notes here: In an old book the stories of Pomil are placed
before those ofUisang and Wonhyo. But since Uisang and Wonhyo lived
during the reign ofTang Kao-tsung in China(649-683) and Pomi! in the
days of Hui-ch 'ang 170 years later, this is a mistake in chronology. Some
scholars say that Pomi! was a disciple of U isang, but this also is a mis­

" In a forest fire which broke out a hundred years after these events, :l all the temples and shrines on Naksan went up in flames except the
temples of the Kwanilm and ChOngch'wi Bodhisattvas.
After the Invasion of the West Mountain (the Mangol invasion,
1253-1254) the images of the two Bodhisattvas together with the two
jewels were moved to Yangju-song (Yangyang, Kangwondo). When
:1 the city was about to fall to the Mongols, Ahaeng the abbot (formerly
,; -called Hili-ko) tried to save the rosaries by hiding them in a brass vessel.
!i Kolsilng, a temple slave, buried this vessel in the ground and swore
an oath: "If I do not escape death in this war these treasures will
i , vanish from the human world forever, but if I survive I will present
them to the King."
Finally, on the twenty-second of October in the year of the tiger
(1254) Ahaeng was killed when the city fell, but Kolsilng escaped. When
il the enemy had evacuated the ruined city he dug up the brass vessel and
ii presented it to Yi Nok-yu, the keeper of the royal treasury, to be pre­

'I 	 served under strong guard. In October of the year of the horse (l25~)
l! 	 Kakyu, the abbot of Chirim-sa, said to the King, "The two rosaries
·are sacred treasures ofthe nation. Before the fall ofYangju Kolsilng the
temple slave buried them in the city, and after the enemy left he dug
them up and presented them to the royal treasury in Myongju. Now
Myongju is in imminent danger of falling into enemy hands, so they
should be transferred to Your Majesty's inner p,alace."
The King approved this plan and sent ten soldiers to Myongju by
I: 	 night to fetch the rosaries and bring them to his inner palace. He I'
II rewarded the ten soldiers with one pqund of silver and five large bags
~f rice each.
During the Silla period when the Kings ruled in Kyongju there
was in Nalli county in Myongju prefecture a manor belonging to Sekyu
Temple (now called Hilnggyo-~a). The abbot of this temple appointed
a young monk named Chosin careta~er of the manor. No sooner had
,
II 	 he arrived to take up his duties than Chosin feV. in love with the daugh­
II ter of Kim Hun-kong, the county magistrate. She was a girl of sixteen,

Samguk Yusa
fairer than the moon and more charming than all the flowers put to­
gether. But though she smib~dt on him she was unyielding, like a bell­
flower growing betweem rocks tOG DEgh for his hands to reach.
At length he kneltbef.ore the: goddess of mercy, who now appeared
to him in the sembfrurce of hi;$, love, and prayed, uOh great Buddha!
Only make this.gid my wife for even a moment's joy if not for life, for
.she is my jewel, whfcb l wish to cherish in my bosom in love's palace
I,on earth before I ealm-tbe to·tus paradise in heaven. So be it, Namu­
'amitabul !"
Thus he prayed all through the flowering spring and the rainy
autumn, but all in vain, for the girl was betrothed to another man.
When he thought of the blooming bride in her glittering jewels and
compared the richly-dressed bridegroom with himself-a poor monk
in a grey hemp robe-he shed tears of bitter despair.
At last the wedding day arrived,. and as Chosin knelt for his evening
prayers he saw ilj his mind's eye the magnificent wedding feast and the
lovemaking of the young couple. A flame ofjealousy rose in his heart.
and he said to himself, "Go and kill the bridegroom! Set fire to the
rich man's house! Destroy everything and jump into the flames! If
you die you will forget the girl and everything else in this tragic world."
Chosin writhed in an agony like that of death, complaining to
Buddha for not answering his prayer. At last, worn out with weeping,
he fem asleep in the Buddha Hall.
Suddenly an autumn breeze blew out the candles. Chosin looked
toward the door, which was ajar, and as he did so it was flung open and
there in the moonlight stood the bride, fresh as a rosebud in her wed­
ding dress. She threw her arms around his neck and pressed her face
to his bosom, sobbing softly.
Chosin was dumbfounded with joy and surprise. "This is your
wedding night," he said. "Why have you forsaken your bridegroom ?'.
"He is my parents' choice," she said softly through her tears.
"I do not want him. You have my love." And her slender body moved
in his. arms like a butterfly dancing on a flower.
"You love me?" Chosin asked.
-248 Pagodas and Buddhist Images
"A woman is kept within her garden walls," the girl replied. "She
is forbidden to meet young men. Though I am a girl of gentle birth.
since we met in .the rosebed under the tunnel of wildflowers, eye to eye
and lip to lip, I havf! not forgotten you for a moment. I am yours, and
I have come to live with you and be your love until we go together to
the same grave."
Chosin clasped his bride in his arms and danced for joy. Then he
took her hand and led her from the Buddha Hall and down a mountain
path, until they reached a quiet valley near his native place. Here he
built a snug cotttage in the green forest. It was only a one-room cabin
but it was sweet to Chosin, for he and his wife loved each other pas­
sionately. He was familiar with the forest and made his living by cutting
wood and hunting hare and deer. which he and his love-mate cooked
in a pan over crackling flames and ate with good appetite.
Time sped by like a warrior's arrow, and at last .they had lived
together in the forest for forty years, during which five children were
born to them. They had been able to live for some time by selling the
bride's jewelry, but at last it was all gone and they were reduced to
abject poverty. There was not a grain of rice or barley in the house and
the family had to subsist on grass and roots. Chosin hunted and cut
wood as diligently as he was able, but he could not supply his now large
family with even the bare necessities of life. He knew that killing the
mountain creatures was against the commandment of Buddha, not to
speak of the sin of living with a woman, but now he would have killed
even human beings to keep his wife and children from starvation.
The whole family wandered in rags through the mountain villages
begging for food. As they were crossing Haehyon-nyong (Crab Pass)
their fifteen-year-old eldest son fell de~d of hunger. With many tears
Chosin and his wife buried the beloved child on the mountainside and
continued with the remaining four to Ugok-hyon (now U-hyon), where
they built a lowly cottage with a thatched roof.
More years passed. Now Chosin and his wife were as grey as if
snow had fallen on their heads, and thin and pale as death. Both of
them fell ill, while their children cried for fOod. The ten-year-old
-249­

Pagodas and Buddhist ImagesSamguk Yusa
daughter walked fifteen miles through the mountain villages begging
for food for the family; She was bitten by a str.ay dog and collapsed
in pain on her return. Tears streamed down the sunken cheeks of the
aged couple.
At last, wiping away her tears, the old wife spoke to her husband:
"When I married you in the flower of my youth and beauty, you kissed
my blushing cheeks and called them roses. Then we had fine clothes to
wear and good food to eat, and our married love deepened as long as
the mellow wine flowed from our barrels, But now my rosy cheeks and
cherry lips and the glow of strength in your eyes are gone. Nothing is
left to us but sunken stomachs, the pains of old age, sorrow and the
fear ofdeath. No one in this wide world will give us so much as a night's
sojourn in a storeroom or a bottle of soy-sauce. We have become a
laughing-stock.
"If we cannot feed our own children, how can we enjoy our
remaining years in love? Coquettish smiles have vanished like the dew,
and the pledge of our love has fled like the pussy-willows on the four
winds. The passionate, carnal desires of our green youth have led only
to this bottomless grief of the grey winter. It would be better to be a
lone bird pecking at a mirror and calling for its mate than a pair dying
with its young in hunger and cold. It is intolerable that lovers should
meet in wealth and part in poverty, but such is the end of our ill-fated
love. Since there is no other remedy, let us kiss and part, each taking
two of the children."
Chosin consented, though he grieved deeply at the thought of
parting from his loving wife and two of his children. "Farewell, hus­
band," said his wife. "I am going to myoid home in the north; you go
south." At this bitter parting, Chosin gave a great cry, and awoke.
Ithad all been a dream. He lay in the Buddha hall, before the altar,
where the candle he had lighted had burned down to a stump. In one
night he had tasted all the sweetness and bitterness of life. Tears of
disillusion stood in his eyes. As the dying moon sank into the bosom
of the sea, the dawn light revealed that his hair and beard had turned
white in a few hours. With his disenchantment with love came a turning away from all worldly ambition. He was tired of work, and the. hot:
flame of greed in his heart melted away as. if it had been cold ic.e. I~'
shame and remorse he turned his eyes from the holy Buddha images to
the frost-covered tiles of the temple roof, which shone like spearheads.
Chosin then went to Haehyon-nyong (Crab Pass) where he had
buried his son in the dream. Digging in the place of the imagined grave,
he discovered a stone image of Maitreya Buddha, which he enshrined
in a nearby temple. After this he returned to his home temple in the
capital and resigned from the position ofcaretaker of the country manor
at Myongju. Before his death he built CMngt'o-sa (Temple of the
Purified Land) with funds from his private fortune.
Reading this story, we realize that not only Chosin but many
people like him dream the same dream, and we give them warning in the
following lines.
Youth and beauty may meet in love for a moment's joy,
But rosy cheeks soon pale in sadness, like autumn leaves;
Wealth and nobility are like floating clouds,
And this temporal life of desire is only an empty dream;
Men's good or bad behavior stems from their inner minds,
Yet young men dream of fair brows and thieves of treasure;
Behold how one night's dreaming under the autumn sky I
Can lead a man to enjoy the cool air with closed eyes. --l

~Ol. M;racles of Hyesuk and Hyegon.
, The monk Hyesuk was in his youth a follower of Hoserang, one of
the most renowned of the Hwarang of Silla. When his master was
excluded from this order, Hyesuk retired to a mountain villa called
ChOkson-ch'on (ChOkkok-ch'on in Ankang-hy15n), where: he led the
life of a religious recluse for twenty years.
One day Kugam, a noble Hwarang came riding to hunt in the
mountains near his residence. Hyesuk ran out to meet him and held his
horse's head. "Welcome, master," he said. "Permit me to follow you in
the hunt. I can keep up with your steed on my flying feet."
"FineI" said Kugam. "Come along, then." They had a long chase
over the hills, and when they had killed many birds and animals with
their arrows they sat down to rest while the meat was cooked and fell
into cortversation.
"I have some meat more delicious than this," Hyesuk said. "May
I serve it to you?"
"Good, bring it," said Kugam. "I have a good appetite today."
Hyesuk thereupon cut a piece of flesh from his thigh with a sharp
knife and set it before Kugam. "Please help yourself," he said.
"What are you doing?" Kugam exclaimed in astonishment.
Then Hyesuk admonished him. "I thought you were a kind-hearted
gentleman and merciful to your fellow creatures, so I followed you in
admiration of your high virtues. But now I see that you are a cruel and
selfish man who likes to kill living creatures, doing harm to others in
order to fill your stomach. This is not the way of benevolence and you
do not belong to our order." And with these words he went away.
"Ah, the sad day," ,said Kugam, blushing with shame. "But what
is this? I have eaten my fill, and yet the table is still spread with the same
-294­Anecdotes 0/ Renowned Monks
dishes and appears untouched."
Kugam returned and told his strange story to King Chinp'yong.
The King thought that Hyesuk must be an uncommon monk, arul sent
an official to fetch him to the court. When the official arrived he found
Hyesuk (as he thought) lying in bed with a woman, and cursing him for
his shameless breach of Buddhist law turned back. But he hadgone only
seven or eight Ii when he met the same monk coming from the opposite
direction. "Hello, good monk," he said, "where have you been?"
"I have been at a rich man's house in the city." Hyesuk said. "I
officiated at a memorial service and offered prayers for the departed
soul for seven days, and now I am returning to my home in the moun­
tains."
The official went and reported his experience at court. Puzzled, the
King sent a messenger to the house Hyesuk had mentioned and found
that indeed the monk had been there when he said he was.
Not long after this Hyesuk died and the village people buried him
on a hill east of E-hyon (Ear Pass). But while his friends were still
crowded around the grave a traveler arrived from the other side of E­
hyon who said that he had just met Hyesuk over the hill. When asked
where he was going, Hyesuk had said, "I have lived too long in this
mountain vi11age and now I am going on a sight-seeing trip." Then,
the traveller said, the monk had mounted a cloud and soared into the
sky about half a mile from where he had said goodbye. Amazed. the
villagers dug into the grave they had just finished, and found in it only
one of the monk's old shoes.
Even today there is a temple called Hyesuk-sa north of Ankang­
hyon, where the mysterious monk lived, IlQd visitors can see his image
in bas-relief on one of its walls.
Another famous Silla monk was named Hyegong. He was the son
of a woman servant in the house of Ch'onjin-kong and his childhood
name was Ujo. One day the master ,~f the house was taken seriously ill
with a maligllant growth, and felt that death was approaching. The
house was constantly full of pedple, noble and cgmmon, who came
to ellquire after his health. Ujo was only seven years old, but he
-295­

knew that something unusual had happened.
"0 my mother," the child said, "What has brought so many
peope into this house?"
"Don'tyou know," she replied, "that the master ofthe house is very
sick, and lies upon his deathbed T'
"I can cure his disease," said Ujo.
"What! YOllcan, can you?"
"Yes I can."
With a wondering heart the woman told Ch'onjin-kong what her
child had said, and the nobleman sent a servant to fetch tbe lad.
When Ujo appeared he sat down at the foot ofthe sick man's bed with
his mouth shut tight. Then suddenly the abcess burst and the patient
was saved. Ch'onjin-kong did not wonder greatly at this, however,
considering it to have been a mere cQmcidence.
When Ujo had grown into a youth he tamed Ch'onjin-kong's pet
falcon, and was such a good fowler that his master could not help
liking him. One day Ch'onjin-kom,g's younger brother set out on a
,long journey to take up a new official post in the country and took this
hawk with him by permission of the nobleman. But one night Ch'onjin­
kong bethought him of his faraway falcon and decided to send Ujo
to bring it back early the next morning.
Ujo knew the mind of his master. Magically, he brought the:falcon
back in an instant and presented it to Ch'onjin-kong before daybreak,
The latter reflected that this was the same lad who had cured his abcess,
earlier. "I did not know a great sage was living in my house," he
exclaimed, "and 1 abused him with mad words and discourtesy. How
can I apologize enough to you? And he stepped down into the
courtyard and made a low bow to the fowler boy.
When Ujo's wonder-workings had become widely known in the
world he became a monk, changing his name to Hyegong, and went
to live at a small temple. He often d rank wine like a whale and staggered
about the streets singing and dancing like a madman, with a pan­
shaped refuse basket slung over his shoulder. The people called him
Pugwe-Hwasang (Basket-carrying monk) and named his temple:
-296­19
I
Anecdotes of Renowned Monks
Pugae-sa (a corruption of Pug we-sa).
He often went down into the temple well and would not come "
out for two or three months, so this well was named after him. When
he did come out a heavenly being dressed in blue was SUre to precede
him. Stranger still, even though he had been sitting in the water for so
long, his robe never got wet.
Late in life he went to live at Hangsa-sa (now Oo-sa in Yongil­
hyon), where he associated with the great monk Wonhyo, who was then
compiling a commentary on the Buddhist scriptures. Wonhyo asked
him all sorts of difficult questions which he did not understand, but
he would always answer quickly and in jest. One day the two monks
went fishing and made a good catch. While they were eating some of
the fish on a rock, Hyegong laughingly said, "You eat my fish." From
that time the people called the temple Oo-sa (My Fish Temple.)
One day when Kugam-kong was out on a picnic he found the
body of Hyegong on a mountain path, mouldering in the open air and
infested with maggots. He mourned over the body of the faithful
follower of his Hwarang days and returned to Kyongju, where he
found Hyegong singing and dancing merrily in his cups. {This sounds as
if Hyegong had gotten confused with Hyesuk.}
Another time Hyegong twisted rice-straw into a long rope and
wrapped it round and round the Golden Hall and the south gate tower
of Yongmyo-sa. Then he said to the chief monk, "Undo this fastening
in three days and you will see a miracle." The dumbfounded monk
followed his directions and sure enough, in three days the beautiful
Queen Sond5k visited the temple and the flames of Chigwi, the "Love
fire of the heart" swallowed the temple pagoda, but the Golden Hall
and the tower were not damaged,! "
Myongnang, the founder of Sinin-sa (Heavenly Seal Temple) also
founded Kilmgang-sa (Diamond Temple) and held a ceremony on this
occasion in which the nation's most eminent monks participated.
Hyegong was abseQt, and it was not until after Myongnang had lighted
incense and chanted prayers that he appeared in, the temple. He carne
through a heavy downpour but his robe was not wet, nor were his.

feet soiled with mud. He smiled at Myongnang and said, "You called
me, so here I am."
After working countless wonders like this he disappeared into
the sky, from which thousands of sari fell toeartth. While in this life

: -:'~\ From this it would appear that Cho was one of his previous incar­
nations.
(Some of the antics of Hyegong are strongly suggestive of the
tenets of the Son (Zen) sect, which held that the study of scripture
was worthless and that only pure meditation could bring salvatiOIl.
The apparently pointless tricks of tlte monks of this sect were intended
to detach the neophyte's mind from the logic and conventions of the
material world so that it might more readily penetrate to the spiritual
reality behind it and thus achieve enlightenment.)
Song of Praise to Hyesuk and Hyegong

And return to sleep in a woman's bed.

And returning, sleep in the well.

102. Cbajang Establisbes tbe Buddbist Laws
The family name of the great monk Chajang was Kim-ssi and he
was the son of Murim, a nobleman of Chingol (royal) stock who was
honored with the third-rank title ofSopan in Chinhan. His father was
an important court official who, since he had no son, prayed to
Kwanum Boddhisattva, pledging, "Jf I have a son f will make him
a bridge to the world of Buddha."
On the night when he ended his prayer, his wife 'dreamed that a
star fell from heaven and entered her bosom. She conceived that very
~98 ­Anecdotes ofRenowend Monks
night and in due time bore a son. This was Chajang. Because he was
born on Buddha's birthday he was named Sonjongnang.
Chajang was pure of heart and keen of mind. He had no use for
worldly ;Jleasures and occupied himself solely with literature and art.
In his youth fiRe verses rich in noble conceptions already floweo from
his brush. He was orphaned early in life. Tired of the annoyances of
worldly society he took leave of his wife and children and gave away
his estates to found a temple called W onyong-sa. There he lived a
hermit's life in the deep mountains, unafraid of tigers and wolves, and
meditated on the transience of this life, seeing all human beings as no
more than withered bones.
In order to combat weariness and idleness he built a small cell;
whose four walls were covered with brambles and thorns and whose
ceiling consisted ofchestnut burrs. He sat naked and erect in the middle
of this cell with his head tied to a roof-beam to help keep his mind in
full awareness. '
At that time a ministerial post fell vacant at court and Chajaog was
repeatedly asked to fill it in view ofhls noble birth,2 but he consistently
refused. The King was displeased and sent a message saying, "Ifyou do
110t accep, this official position I will have your head cut off for diso­
bedience to your King."
But the dauntless monk replied, .of would rather die in one day
for the sake of keeping Buddha's commandments than live for a
hundred years while breaking them." When the King received this
reply, he finally gave formal permission for Chajang to remain a monk
for life.
There was nothing to eat among the rocks and trees where he lived, , e~
and he would surely have starved to death~had it not been for a strange
bird which brought him dainty and nourishing fruit for his daily food.
One day he fell into a trance in which a heavenly being appeared to ,
him and expounded the Five Commandments of Buddha. After this
he walked down iQto the valley and began explaining these com­
mandments to the people, who gathered from near and far with great
rejoicing.

"'i, The stranger cooly replied, "Go and tell your master that I am
here to see him-only that and nothing more."
When the incident was described to Chajang he wondered if the
fellow were a madman. But when they shouted at him to go, the old man
said "How can a Narcissus see me?" and turned his basket upside
down. Out ofit came, not a dead puppy but a lion on a throne, radiating
a dazzling light for a moment, and then the old man vanished. (A
symbol of Buddha as preeminent among both men and beasts.)
Informed of this miracle, Chajang hastened to pursue the light
until he reached Namnyong (South Pass), where it vanished in a mist.
As it did so, Chajang fell dead. He was cremated there and his bones
enshrined In a cave.
During his lifetime Chajang founded more than a dozen temples
and pagodas, and on each such occasion unusually auspicious signs
appeared. This brought faithful followers to him in crowds to help
compleJ~" ..the-sacr:ed buildings quickly. His perso~J!-Le~cts; including

used to play there and did some miracles. A monk named Wonsung
preceded Chajang to China and returned to Silla with him to help in
the propagation of Buddhism there.

'--:03. Woahyo, the Unbridled MoDk
The family name of the sacred monk Wonhyo was Sol-ssi, His
grandfather was Ingp'i-kong, otherwise called ChOktae-kong, whose
shrine now stands near Choktaeyon pool. His great-grandfather was
Tamnal-naemal.
The birth of Wonhyo came about in this manner, When his mother
was near her time she was passing under a chestnut tree to the southwest
of Yulgok (Chestnut Valley) north ofPuljich'on (Village ofthe Buddha
Mind) south of Apnyang county. There suddenly her labor pains came
upon her. As there was no time to reach shelter her husband's clothes
were hung from the branches ofthe tree to hide her from view. The local
folk call this chestnut tree Sala-su and its fruit Sala-yul. It has a peculiar
shape and an uncommon flavor.
(This story is remarkably similar to that of the birth of Buddha as
recorded in the scriptures. "SaZa" is the name of the tree under which
Buddha is said to have departed this life and entered Nirvana.)
There is a legend that long, long ago an abbot gave his temple
slave two chestnuts for his supper. The indignant slave brought suit
against the abbot because of his meager rations. The local magistrate
ordered the slave to produce the chestnuts, and when he did so it was
observed that one of them was large enough to fill a wooden bowl.
The magistrate therefore ruled that henceforth" only one chestnut
should be given for a meal. Since that time the place where these chest­
nuts grew has been called Yulgok (Chestnut Valley).
When Wonhyo became a monk,he gave away his house for the
foundation of a temple called Ch'ogae-sa (Temple of First Opening)
and near a tree in his garden he built another temple named Sal a-sa.
In his biography Wonhyo is represented as a man of Kyongju
because his grandfather lived there, but the T'ang Biographies of
Monks describes. him as a native of Ha-Sangju. In the second year of
Lin-te (665) King Munmu of: Silla divided the old land of Sangju and
Haju to create Sapnyangju in the new territory: Haju is now Ch'ang­

Samgllk Yusa
nyong county and Apnyang county was originally a sub-prefecture of.
Haju. Pulchich'on was part of the Chain-hyon of today, a sub-pre­
fecture of Apnyang county.
Wonhyo's childhood names were So-tang (Pledging Flag) and Sin­
tang (New Flag). On the night he was conceived his mother dreamed
that a shooting star entered her bosom, and when he was born five­
colored clouds covered the earth. This was in the thirty-ninth year of
King Chinp'yong of Silla (617).
As the boy grew into a healthy and handsome youth he proved to
be an uncommon person. He did not study with a teacher, b~t.J~ew

\~l:-incl\:ld~(jl'llyafew anecdotes from the'B~of Silla. "1,
One day Wonhyo saw bees and butterflies flitting from flower to
flower, and he felt a strong desire for a woman. He walked through the
streets of Kyongju singing, "Who will lend me an axe that has lost its
handle? I wish to cut a heaven-supporting pole." The passers-by
laughed at him, 110t realizing the real meaning ofhis song, but T'aejong
(King Muryal) said when he heard it, "The love-lorn monk wants to
marry a noble lady and get a wise son by her. If a sage is born, so much
the better for the country."
(Wonhyo's song alludes to a poem in the Book of Odes, one of the
ConfUCian Classics. In this poem the axe-handle symbolizes the male sexual
organ, so that an axe without a handle means a widow. WOllhyo is looking
for a go-between to find a widow to be his lover, and the King agrees.to
play this part. This is one more example of Wonhyo's disregard of con­
vention, since ConfUCian custom forbade widows to remarry or otherwise
ha),e to do with men.)
There was at this time a widowed princess living in Yosok Palace
(now a monastery, I1yon says). The King told his servants to conduct
Wonhyo to that palace, and they found that he had already descended
Namsan (South Mountain) and reached Munch'on-gyo, the Mosquito
Stream Bridge. Here he deliberately fell into the stream and got his.

The princess became pregnant as a result, and bore a son whose
name was Sol Ch'ong. He was so intelligent that he mastered all the
classical histories in his youth. He composed books on folk customs
and the place-names of China and Silla, using the "Idu" system of
.' sip:1plified Chinese characters as phonetic signs to convey the Korean
language. Until then there had been no method of writing the Korean
language and people who wished to be educated had to read and write
in Chinese, although the spoken Korean language is distinctly
different from Chinese.
Sol Ch'ong also translated the Six Chinese Classics (Probably the
Confucian Classics are meant) into Korean by this method and wrote
commentaries on them. All these have been handed down to the scho­
lars ofthe East (Korea). For his virtuous deeds and literary accomplish­
ments, Sol Ch'ong is acclaimed as one of the ten sages of Silla. (Un­
fortunately, all but one of Sol Chong's works are lost.)
Having broken a Buddhist commandment by his union with the
princess and the birth of Sol Ch'ong, Wonhyo doffed his monk's robe
and put on secular dress, adopting the punning nickname Sosong Kosa
(Little Hermit). One day he met an actor and performed a gourd dance,
wearing a grotesque mask on his face. He made a utensil in the shape of
a gourd and called it Mu-ae (Boundless; this is an allusion to the
Hwaom sect scriptural phrase, "Both life and death are Nirvana and
paradise when a sage king rules within the bounds of decorum and
music"). He composed a song about the gqurd for this dance. Wearing
the mask and carrying the gourd he performed his dance in every corner
ofthe country, so that eVen usurers and poor old bachelors (both much

When he wrote a commentary on the Hwaom scripture he stopped
at the fortieth chapter, and when he lived at Punhwang temple in
early life he was constantly occupied with public affairs. For these
reasons he never rose above the lowest ranks ofthe monks. Guided by
a sea dragon, he received a commandment from Buddha to write while
traveling a song aoout Sammae-gyong. He put his ink-stone and his
writing brush on the two horns ofthe ox he rode, and therefore people
called him Kaksilng (Horn Rider). The two horns represented the
awake!ljng.o:f·h~ inner self and of the inner selves of others. He met
'Ilean popsa"...-another famous monk, who presented Wonhyo with
wIj'irng·pap;r, and they chanted the song together.
When W onhyo died his bones were crushed and incorporated in to
a lifelike image of him which his son Sol Ch'ong enshrined in Pun­
hwang-sa, where he held a memorial service and chanted a dirge in his
father's memory. As SI:SI Ch'ong prostrated himself to. one side of the
image, it suddenly turned its head toward him This image is still to be
seen, with its head turned to one side. Legend says that Sol Ch'ong
lived in a cottage near a cave where his father had once lived. The
ruins of this cottage are still there.

104. Uisang Transmits the Hwaom Sutra to the Cardinal Temples jUisang's father was Han-sin and his family name was Kim. At the
age of twenty-nine he shaved his head and became a monk, residing at
Hwangpok Temple. Soon afterward he decided to go to China to study t Buddhist doctrine, and set out on his journey with Wbnhyo. But when j
he reached Liaotung he was arrested by Koguryo border guards and ! Anecdotes 0/ Renowned MOllks
detained for ten days, after which he was allowed to return home.
(I1yon says this account is found in Ch'oe Hu's Chronicles and in
Wonhyo's Autobiography.)
In the first yearofYing-hui(650)hejoined the party ofa T'angenvoy
returning to China and entered the Middle Kingdom. When he ar­
rived at Yangchow, the Chinese military commander there gave hitn a
luxurious reception and provided him with living quarters in the govern­
ment headquarters. After a few days he visited the monk Chih-yen on
the South Mountain of Changan. Chih-yen had had a dream the night
before in which he had seen a great tree growing in Haedong (Silla)
whose boughs and leaves covered the whole of Shenchow (Land of
God, i.e. China) and in the top ofwhich was a phoenix nest. He climbed
the tree, and his eyes were dazzled by M anipao (jewels said to have
been emitted from the brain of a king dragon) whose light radiated far
and wide. Waking in wonder and surprise, he tidied his house and
waited until Uisang knocked at his door. After receiving his guest with
special ceremony he said, "In a dream last night I saw signs of your
coming." The two sat facing each other and discussed the mysteries
of the Hwaom Sutra to the profoundest depths. Chih-yen was glad to
hear the intelligent words of Uisang, and declared that his visitor
outshone him on many points of Buddhist scripture.
At this time the Silla ministers Kim Hum-sun (another book says
Kim In-mun, Ilyon notes) and Yang-to were detained in Changan by
T'ang Emperor Kao-tsung, who was planning to attack Silla with a
large army. Uisang was informed of this by Hum-sun, who urged him
to return home at once and warn the court. Therefore, in the first year
of Hsien-heng (670), Uisang returned to Silla and told King Munmu of
the imminent danger. At the same tl'(l1e he ordered Myl:Sngnang, a
clever monk, to improvise a secret Buddhist altar to deceive a Chinese
envoy who had come to Kyongju for purposes of espionage. Thus
the King was able to surmount the crisis.

Uisang at Chih-yen's monastery, sent Uisang a copy of his Selections

Peach. Here is her lifelike image.' "
When Wang Hsiang, a Sung envoy, came to Koryo, he offered
sacrifice to the goddess-mother and read a memorial which said in
part, "She gave birth to a sage who founded a nation."
Shasu donated gold to make a Buddhist image. She lighted the
incense and established a ferry and bridge, not for herself to enjoy
long life, but for all creatures to enter paradise. (Here is a perfect
example of the way in which Buddhism assimilated the beliefs which
it encountered. The goddess-mother, who very probably constitutes
a legend antedating the coming of Buddhism, is incorporated into the
Buddhist scheme of things by being given the attributes of a Bodhi­
sattva.)

~5. Ukmyon, the Slave Gid who En''''''' the Lotu, Pa,..,i"
During the reign of King Kyongdok (742-765) a group of devoted
Buddhists in Kangju (now Chinju) built a temple called Mita-sa in
a grove of trees and began to worship Buddha for ten thousand days
in order to enter the lotus paradise. Among the worshippers was a
female slave belonging to the aristocratic family of Kwi-jin whose
name was Ukmyon. She followed her noble master to the temple every
evening and offered a prayer, standing outside in the courtyard and
bowing toward the august image in the main hall.
Her unkind master did not like this. He gave lier two large bags
(ten bushels) of rice to pound to pearly white each day, to keep her
-342­Tales ofDevotion
'busy at home. But she worked so diligently that she was able to attend
prayers before dawn and after sunset each day. Moreover, as a sign
of her devotion, she gouged holes in her two hands and passed a
straw rope through them, which was then tied to two pegs on opposite
sides of the temple courtyard.
One evening the assembled worhsippers heard a voice from the
sky, which said, "Ukmyon, my faithful maid, enter the main hall of
the Buddha and offer your prayer." They invited the poor girl to enter,
and she approached the image of the merciful Buddha on her knees
and murmured her prayer in a low voice, lifting her eyes in rapture
to the half-closed eyes of Buddha. Suddenly the sound of heavenly
music was heard from the west, and a swift whirlwind swept into the
palace of the Buddha. Ukmyon was lifted into the sky through a
gaping hole in the ceiling and roof, higher and higher as she flew to­
ward the western side of the temple. There her mortal body fell away
and she became a Kwanum (Goddess of Mercy) seated on a lotus
pedestal and flew to the lotus paradise while heavenly music con­
tinued from the sky and brilliant rays illuminated the rapturous
spectators below.
Another version of this story is found in the Book of Monks
{Sung-jon). Tongnyang-P'aljin, an incarnation of Kwanum, organized
a Hwarang order of one thousand men and divided them into two
groups, one for physical labor and one for mental culture. One of the
members of the labor group violated the Buddhist commandments
and in consequence was reborn as a cow at Pusok Temple. While carry­
ing Buddhist books on her back the cow died and was reborn as a
human being by the power of the books: This was Ukmyon, a slave
in the household of Kwijin, a nobleman.
One day Ukmyon went on an errand to a mountain called Haga­
san, and there she experienced a trance in which she saw Buddha and
was possessed with the holy spirit.'>·
Mita-sa, found~d by Hyesuk Popsa, was not far from the house
of Kwijin. For nine years, wh~never her master went to worship
Buddha in that temple, Ukmyon followed him to offer her prayers.

On the twenty-first day of the first month of the tenth year, while she
was worshipping Buddha, she soared up into the sky, breaking through'

est peak of Sobaek-san, where she dropped one of her straw shoes.
The first Bo Temple was built near this mountain crest; The second
Bo Temple was built in a grove of Bo trees (Bodedrum) below the
mountain, where she shed her earthly shell and her soul entered the
lotus paradise. At Mita-sa there was hung a gilt panel which read
"Ukmyon's Ascension Palace."
In the roof of the temple there was a hole large enough for a man
to pass through, and wonderfut to tell, even during heavy rain and
snow the palace of Buddha where her image was seated never got wet.
In later generations, however, the admirers of Ukmyon filled the hole
by building a gilt pagoda on the floor of the temple, decorated with
lotus petals and buds, and on this pagoda they inscribed the story of
Ukmyon the slave girl.
After Ukmyon had gone to the lotus paradise, Kwijin donated
his house to the monks, declaring it to be a holy place where an angel
had lived. When it had been remodeled into a temple he called it
popwang-sa. He also donated farmland to the temple.
After many years, when the temple lay in ruins on a hillside, a
pious monk named Hoegyong, together with Yusok and Yi Won­
chang, two local officials, promoted its reconstruction. Hoegyong,
the strong monk, carried the timbers on his shoulders. In a dream
one night an old man gave him two pairs of shoes woven of hemp and
arrowroot vines, led him to the old shrine, and pointed out some
giant trees in the forest, giving him instruction in Buddhist doctrine.
(When he awoke) Hoegyong felled the trees and used them in building
the temple, which was finished in five years. This was the famous
temple of slaves in the southeast. All the pilgrims who visited it said
that Kwijin had been reborn as Hoegyong, the good monk.
An old local legend book says the miracle of Ukmyon occurred
during the reign of King Kyongdok, whereas the Biography of Jin
says that she lived during the reign of King Aejang and did this wonder
-344­Tales of Devotioll
in the third year of Yuan-huo (808). There were four kings between
the reigns of Kings Kyongdok and Aejang during a period of more
than sixty years. In fact, K wijin came first and Ukmyon last. The
biography differs from the legend in introducing them the other way
around.
(This is fairly mystifying as the present text represents them as COIl­
temporaries.)
Song in Praise of Ukmyon
When Buddha's lantern was bright in the old western temple,
She finished pounding rice to worship Buddha at midnight;
She punctured her clasped hands with a straw rope to mortify
her flesh;
As she murmured softly in prayer she flew to heaven in Buddha's J
arms.
116. Kwangdok and Omjang, Two Friendly Monks
During the reign of King Munmu (661-681) two friendly monks
lived in Kyongju. Kwangdok lived in a quiet place in the western
precincts of Punhwang Temple with his wife and made his living by
weaving straw shoes, and Omjang worked on a farm near a hermitage
which he had built in the valley of Nam-ak.
One evening as the last rays of sunlight illuminated the silent
treetops. Omjang heard a voice: "I am going to t11e lotus paradise.
Be faithful to Buddha and come to see me there soon. Goodbye."
Omjang saw that a rainbow had made a bridge from earth to heav­" en, while sweet music played above the Clouds. He envied his friend,
who had gone to the world of eternal peace and comfort ahead of
him, and sighed, "Ah me! It is his voice telling of his journey home to
paradise. Indeed, we promised to inform one another of our final de­
parture from earth, to heaven, and now the angels have taken him
first." ,
Early next morning Omjan~ visited the home of Kwangdok and

During the night gods and goddesses descended from heaven and
restored the stone to its original condition. Tae-s<Sng awoke in joy and
climbed the southern peak of Mt. T'oham, where he burned incense
and worshipped the celestial deities. People thereafter called the place
Hyang-ny<sng (Incense Peak).
The two stone bridges of the blue and white clouds, the seven­
treasure lotus flowers and the two pagodas, Tabo-t'ap (Pagoda ofMany
Treasures) and Sokka-t'ap (Pagoda of Sakyamuni) at Pulguk-sa, in
addition to the seated image of Buddha and the bas-reliefs ofKwanum
on the walls and ceiling of Sokkul-am, are unsurpassed in exquisite
workmanship among the art works in the temples of Korea. 4
In addition to the above account, which is derived from old
legends, the official records of these two temples give the following
information: "During the reign of King Kyongdok, Tae-song, the
King's first minister. commenced the construction of Pulguk-sa in the
tenth year of T'ien-pao (742). Tae-s<sng died during the reign of King
Hyegong, on the second of December in the ninth year of Ta-Ii (774);
the construction of the temple was finished some years later."
Song in Praise of Kim Tae-song.
When spring ended in Moryang he donated three furrows ofJand;
When autumn came to Hyang-nyong he harvested ten thousand

137. SOD Sun Offers to Sacrifice his Son.
During the reign of King HOngd6k a poor man named Son Sun
lived in the mountain village of Moryang-ni near Kyongju. After the
death of his father (Hak-san) he and his wife worked at a neighboring
house as day laborers and supported his old mother with the rice and
vegetables they earned in this way.
Son Sun had a little son. This baby ate all the food served to his
grandmother, for she was very fond of her grandson and would put
the dainties she got into his mouth.
"This is good for our son but bad for my mother," Son Sun said.
"We may have another son but we can never have another mother.
We must get rid ofthis hindrance to our first duty." His wife was deeply
moved by her husband's filial piety and readily agreed.
One night the mother took the child and carried it at her breast
while her husband carried a spade on his shoulder, and they climbed
the northern side of Mt. eh'wi northeast of the Village. With heavy
hearts and many tears they began to dig a grave in which to bury their
son alive. But Son Sun's spade struck a stone which gave a musical
sound, and when he dug it out he found it was a small bell of exquisite
beauty, about the size of the water jars which women carryon their
heads.
The young couple looked at the bell with wondering eyes. They
hung it on a tree and struck it with a pebble and it rang with a wonderful
sound. In great joy the wife exclaimed. "We have discovered a wonder­
ful bell, a God-sent gift. My good husband, do not bury my child, but
spare his life." Son Sun agreed. With singing hearts and dancing feet
they descended the hill with the bell and the baby.
On reaching home at daybreak they hung the bell under the eaves
of their thatched house, and ~t swung in the wind and rang out its music
far and wide. The King heard it in his palace and said, "I hear the
