Chapter VI was cut on figures made of stone, wood, etc. (ushabtiu),
which were placed in the tomb, and when the deceased recited it these
figures became alive and did everything he wished. The shabti figure,
took the place of the human funerary sacrifice which was common all
over Egypt before the general adoption of the cult of Osiris under
the XIIth dynasty. About 700 ushabtiu figures were found in the tomb
of Seti I, and many of them are in the British Museum. Chapter VII
is a spell to destroy the Great Serpent Aapep, the Arch-enemy of
Horus the Elder, Ra, Osiris, Horus son of Isis, and of every follower
of Osiris. Chapters VIII and IX secured a passage for the deceased
through the Tuat, and Chapters X and XI gave him power over the
enemies he met there. Chapters XII and XIII gave him great freedom of
movement in the Kingdom of Osiris. Chapter XIV is a prayer in which
Osiris is entreated to put away any feeling of dissatisfaction that
he may have for the deceased, who says, "Wash away my sins, Lord of
Truth; destroy my transgressions, wickedness and iniquity, O God of
Truth. May this god be at peace with me. Destroy the things that are
obstacles between us. Give me peace, and remove all dissatisfaction
from thy heart in respect of me."
