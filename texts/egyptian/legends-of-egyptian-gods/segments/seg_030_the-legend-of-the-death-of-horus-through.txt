THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH OF HORUS THROUGH THE STING OF A SCORPION AND OF
HIS RESURRECTION THROUGH THOTH, AND OTHER MAGICAL TEXTS.


I.--INCANTATIONS AGAINST REPTILES AND NOXIOUS CREATURES IN GENERAL.


Get thee back, Apep, thou enemy of Ra, thou winding serpent in the form
of an intestine, without arms [and] without legs.  Thy body cannot
stand upright so that thou mayest have therein being, long is
thy[FN#199] tail in front of thy den, thou enemy; retreat before Ra.
Thy head shall be cut off, and the slaughter of thee shall be carried
out.  Thou shalt not lift up thy face, for his (i.e., Ra's) flame is in
thy accursed soul.  The odour which is in his chamber of slaughter is
in thy members, and thy form shall be overthrown by the slaughtering
knife of the great god.  The spell of the Scorpion-goddess Serq driveth
back thy might.  Stand still, stand still, and retreat through her
spell.


[FN#199]  Literally, "his."


Be vomited, O poison, I adjure thee to come forth on the earth.  Horus
uttereth a spell over thee, Horus hacketh thee in pieces, he spitteth
upon thee; thou shalt not rise up towards heaven, but shalt totter
downwards, O feeble one, without strength, cowardly, unable to fight,
blind, without eyes, and with thine head turned upside down.  Lift not
up thy face.  Get thee back quickly, and find not the way.  Lie down in
despair, rejoice not, retreat speedily, and show not thy face because
of the speech of Horus, who is perfect in words of power.  The poison
rejoiced, [but] the heart[s] of many were very sad thereat.  Horus hath
smitten it with his magical spells, and he who was in sorrow is [now]
in joy.  Stand still then, O thou who art in sorrow, [for] Horus hath
been endowed with life.  He coineth charged, appearing himself to
overthrow the Sebiu fiends which bite.  All men when they see Ra praise
the son of Osiris.  Get thee back, Worm, and draw out thy poison which
is in all the members of him that is under the knife.  Verily the might
of the word of power of Horus is against thee. Vomit thou, O Enemy, get
thee back, O poison.


9. THE CHAPTER OF CASTING A SPELL ON THE CAT.


Recite [the following formula]:--

"Hail, Ra, come to thy daughter!  A scorpion hath stung her on a
lonely road.  Her cry hath penetrated the heights of heaven, and is
heard along the paths.  The poison hath entered into her body, and
circulateth through her flesh.  She hath set her mouth against
it;[FN#200] verily the poison is in her members.


[FN#200]  i.e., she hath directed her words against it.


"Come then with thy strength, with thy fierce attack, and with thy red
powers, and force it to be hidden before thee.  Behold, the poison hath
entered into all the members of this Cat which is under my fingers.  Be
not afraid, be not afraid, my daughter, my splendour, [for] I have set
myself near (or, behind) thee.  I have overthrown the poison which is
in all the limbs of this Cat.  O thou Cat, thy head is the head of Ra,
the Lord of the Two Lands, the smiter of the rebellious peoples.
Thy[FN#201] fear is in all lands, O Lord of the living, Lord of
eternity.  O thou Cat, thy two eyes are the Eye of the Lord of the Khut
uraeus, who illumineth the Two Lands with his Eye, and illumineth the
face on the path of darkness.  O thou Cat, thy nose is the nose of
Thoth, the Twice Great, Lord of Khemenu (Hermopolis), the Chief of the
Two Lands of Ra, who putteth breath into the nostrils of every person.
O thou Cat, thine ears are the ears of Nebertcher, who hearkeneth unto
the voice of all persons when they appeal to him, and weigheth words
(i.e., judgeth) in all the earth.  O thou Cat, thy mouth is the mouth
of Tem, the Lord of life, the uniter (?) of creation, who hath caused
the union (?) of creation; he shall deliver thee from every poison.  O
thou Cat, thy neck (nehebt) is the neck of Neheb-ka, President of the
Great House, vivifier of men and women by means of the mouth of his two
arms.  O thou Cat, thy breast is the breast of Thoth, the Lord of
Truth, who hath given to thee breath to refresh (?) thy throat, and
hath given breath to that which is therein.  O thou Cat, thy heart is
the heart of the god Ptah, who healeth thy heart of the evil poison
which is in all thy limbs.  O thou Cat, thy hands 25 are the hands of
the Great Company of the gods and the Little Company of the gods, and
they shall deliver thy hand from the poison from the mouth of every
serpent.  O thou Cat, thy belly is the belly of Osiris, Lord of
Busiris, the poison shall not work any of its wishes in thy belly.  O
thou Cat, thy thighs are the thighs of the god Menthu, who shall make
thy thighs to stand up, and shall bring the poison to the ground.  O
thou Cat, thy leg-bones are the leg-bones of Khensu,[FN#202] who
travelleth over all the Two Lands by day and by night, and shall lead
the poison to the ground.  O thou Cat, thy legs (or, feet) are the legs
of Amen the Great, Horus, Lord of Thebes, who shall stablish thy feet
on the earth, and shall overthrow the poison.  O thou Cat, thy haunches
are the haunches of Horus, the avenger (or, advocate) of his father
Osiris, and they shall place Set in the evil which he hath wrought.  O
thou Cat, thy soles are the soles of Ra, who shall make the poison to
return to the earth.  O thou Cat, thy bowels are the bowels of the Cow-
goddess Meh-urt, who shall overthrow and cut in pieces the poison which
is in thy belly and in all the members in thee, and in [all] the
members of the gods in heaven, and in [all] the members of the gods on
earth, and shall overthrow every poison in thee.  There is no member in
thee without the goddess who shall overthrow and cut in pieces the
poison of every male serpent, and every female serpent, and every
scorpion, and every reptile, which may be in any member of this Cat
which is under the knife.  Verily Isis weaveth and Nephthys spinneth
against the poison.  This woven garment strengtheneth this [being,
i.e., Horus], who is perfect in words of power, through the speech of
Ra Heru-khuti, the great god, President of the South and North: 'O evil
poison which is in any member of this Cat which is under the knife,
come, issue forth upon the earth.'"


[FN#201]  Literally "his."


[FN#202]  He was the messenger of the gods, and travelled across the
sky under the form of the Moon; he sometimes appears as a form of
Thoth.


ANOTHER CHAPTER.


Say the [following] words:--

"O Ra-[Khuti], come to thy daughter.  O Shu, come to thy wife.  O Isis,
come to thy sister, and deliver her from the evil poison which is in
all her members.  Hail, O ye gods, come ye and overthrow ye the evil
poison which is in all the members of the Cat which is under the knife.


"Hail, O aged one, who renewest thy youth in thy season, thou old man
who makest thyself to be a boy, grant thou that Thoth may come to me at
[the sound of] my voice, and behold, let him turn back from me Netater.
Osiris is on the water, the Eye of Horus is with him.  A great
Beetle spreadeth himself over him, great by reason of his grasp,
produced by the gods from a child.  He who is over the water appeareth
in a healthy form.  If he who is over the water shall be approached
(or, attacked), the Eye of Horus, which weepeth, shall be approached.


"Get ye back, O ye who dwell in the water, crocodiles, fish, that
Enemy, male dead person and female dead person, male fiend and female
fiend, of every kind whatsoever, lift not up your faces, O ye who dwell
in the waters, ye crocodiles and fish.  When Osiris journeyeth over
you, permit ye him to go to Busiris.  Let your nostrils [be closed],
your throats stopped up.


"Get ye back, Seba fiends!  Lift ye not up your faces against him that
is on the water . . . . . Osiris-Ra, riseth up in his Boat to look at
the gods of Kher-ahat, and the Lords of the Tuat stand up to slay thee
when [thou] comest, O Neha-her, against Osiris.  [When] he is on the
water the Eye of Horus is over him to turn your faces upside down and
to set you on your backs.


"Hail, ye who dwell in the water, crocodiles and fish, Ra shutteth up
your mouths, Sekhet stoppeth up your throats, Thoth cutteth out your
tongues, and {cont} Heka blindeth your eyes.  These are the four great
gods who protect Osiris by their magical power, and they effect the
protection of him that is on the water, of men and women of every kind,
and of beasts and animals of every kind which are on the water by day.
Protected are those who dwell in the waters, protected is the sky
wherein is Ra, protected is the great god who is in the sarcophagus,
protected is he who is on the water.

"A voice [which] crieth loudly is in the House of Net (Neith), a loud
voice is in the Great House, a great outcry from the mouth of the Cat.
The gods and the goddesses say, 'What is it?  What is it?'  [It]
concerneth the Abtu Fish which is born.  Make to retreat from me thy
footsteps, O Sebau fiend.  I am Khnemu, the Lord of Her-urt.  Guard
thyself again from the attack which is repeated, besides this which
thou hast done in the presence of the Great Company of the gods.  Get
thee back, retreat thou from me.  I am the god.  Oh, Oh, O [Ra], hast
thou not heard the voice which cried out loudly until the evening on
the bank of Netit, the voice of all the gods and goddesses which cried
out loudly, the outcry concerning the wickedness which thou hast done,
O wicked Sebau fiend?  Verily the lord Ra thundered and growled
thereat, and he ordered thy slaughter to be carried out.  Get thee
back, Seba fiend!  Hail!  Hail!"


II.--THE NARRATIVE OF ISIS.


I am Isis, [and] I have come forth from the dwelling (or, prison)
wherein my brother Set placed me.  Behold the god Thoth, the great god,
the Chief of Maat[FN#203] [both] in heaven and on the earth, said unto
me, "Come now, O Isis, thou goddess, moreover it is a good thing to
hearken,[FN#204] [for there is] life to one who shall be guided [by the
advice] of another.  Hide thou thyself with [thy] son the child, and
there shall come unto him these things.  His members shall
grow,[FN#205] and two-fold strength of every kind shall spring up [in
him].  [And he] shall be made to take his seat upon the throne of his
father, [whom] he shall avenge,[FN#206] [and he shall take possession
of] the exalted position of Heq[FN#207] of the Two Lands."[FN#208]


[FN#203]  i.e., Law, or Truth.

[FN#204]  Or, obey.

[FN#205]  i.e., flourish.


[FN#206]  He avenged his father Osiris by vanquishing Set.


[FN#207]  i.e., tribal chief.


[FN#208]  i.e., Upper and Lower Egypt.


I came forth [from the dwelling] at the time of evening, and there came
forth the Seven Scorpions which were to accompany me and to strike(?)
for me with [their] stings.  Two scorpions, Tefen and Befen, were
behind me, two scorpions, Mestet and Mestetef, were by my side, and
three scorpions, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet (or, Martet), were for
preparing the road for me.  I charged them very strictly (or, in a loud
voice), and my words penetrated into their ears: "Have no knowledge of
[any], make no cry to the Tesheru beings, and pay no attention to the
'son of a man' (i.e., anyone) who belongeth to a man of no account,"
[and I said,] "Let your faces be turned towards the ground [that ye may
show me] the way."  So the guardian of the company brought me to the
boundaries of the city of Pa-Sui,[FN#209] the city of the goddesses of
the Divine Sandals, [which was situated] in front of the Papyrus
Swamps.[FN#210]


[FN#209]  "The House of the Crocodile," perhaps the same town as Pa-
Sebekt, a district in the VIIth nome of Lower Egypt (Metelites).

[FN#210]  Perhaps a district in the Metelite nome.


When I had arrived at the place where the people lived[FN#211] I came
to the houses wherein dwelt the wives [and] husbands.  And a certain
woman of quality spied me as I was journeying along the road, and she
shut her doors on me.  Now she was sick at heart by reason of those
[scorpions] which were with me.  Then [the Seven Scorpions] took
counsel concerning her, and they all at one time shot out their venom
on the tail of the scorpion Tefen; as for me, the woman Taha[FN#212]
opened her door, and I entered into the house of the miserable lady.


[FN#211]  In Egyptian Teb, which may be the Tebut in the Metelite nome.


[FN#212]  Taha may be the name of a woman, or goddess, or the word may
mean a "dweller in the swamps," as Golenischeff thinks.


Then the scorpion Tefen entered in under the leaves of the door and
smote (i.e., stung) the son of Usert, and a fire broke out in the house
of Usert, and there was no water there to extinguish it; [but] the sky
rained upon the house of Usert, though it was not the season for
rain.[FN#213]


[FN#213]  i.e., it was not the season of the inundation.


Behold, the heart of her who had not opened her door to me was
grievously sad, for she knew not whether he (i.e., her son) would live
[or not], and although she went round about through her town uttering
cries [for help], there was none who came at [the sound of] her voice.
Now mine own heart was grievously sad for the sake of the child, and [I
wished] to make to live [again] him that was free from fault.
[Thereupon] I cried out to the noble lady, "Come to me.  Come to me.
Verily my mouth (?) possesseth life.  I am a daughter [well] known in
her town, [and I] can destroy the demon of death by the spell (or,
utterance) which my father taught me to know. I am his daughter, the
beloved [offspring] of his body."


Then Isis placed her two hands on the child in order to make to live him
whose throat was stopped, [and she said], "O poison of the scorpion
Tefent, come forth and appear on the ground! Thou shalt neither enter
nor penetrate [further into the body of the child].  O poison of the
scorpion Befent, come forth and appear on the ground!  I am Isis, the
goddess, the lady (or, mistress) of words of power, and I am the maker
of words of power (i.e., spells), and I know how to utter words with
magical effect.[FN#214]  Hearken ye unto me, O every reptile which
possesseth the power to bite (i.e., to sting), and fall headlong to the
ground! O poison of the scorpion Mestet, make no advance [into his
body].  O poison of the scorpion Mestetef, rise not up [in his body].  O
poison of the scorpions Petet and Thetet, penetrate not [into his body].
[O poison of] the scorpion Maatet (or, Martet), fall down on the
ground."


[FN#214]  By uttering spells Isis restored life to her husband Osiris
for a season, and so became with child by him.  She made a magical
figure of a reptile, and having endowed it with life, it stung Ra as he
passed through the sky, and the great god almost died.  In Greek times
it was believed that she discovered a medicine which would raise the
dead, and she was reputed to be a great expert in the art of healing
men's sicknesses.  As a goddess she appeared to the sick, and cured
them.


[Here follows the] "Chapter of the stinging [of scorpions]."

And Isis, the goddess, the great mistress of spells (or, words of
power), she who is at the head of the gods, unto whom the god Keb gave
his own magical spells for the driving away of poison at noon-day (?),
and for making poison to go back, and retreat, and withdraw, and go
backward, spake, saying, "Ascend not into heaven, through the command
of the beloved one of Ra, the egg of the Smen goose which cometh forth
from the sycamore.  Verily my words are made to command the uttermost
limit of the night.  I speak unto you, [O scorpions] I am alone and in
sorrow because our names will suffer disgrace throughout the nomes.  Do
not make love, do not cry out to the Tesheru fiends, and cast no
glances upon the noble ladies in their houses.  Turn your faces towards
the earth and [find out] the road, so that we may arrive at the hidden
places in the town of Khebt.[FN#215]  Oh the child shall live and the
poison die!  Ra liveth and the poison dieth!  Verily Horus shall be in
good case (or, healthy) for his mother Isis.  Verily he who is stricken
shall be in good case likewise."


[FN#215]  The island of Chemmis of classical writers.


And the fire [which was in the house of Usert] was extinguished, and
heaven was satisfied with the utterance of Isis, the goddess.


Then the lady Usert came, and she brought unto me her possessions, and
she filled the house of the woman Tah (?), for the Ka of Tah
(?) because [she] had opened to me her door.  Now the lady Usert
suffered pain and anguish the whole night, and her mouth tasted (i.e.,
felt) the sting [which] her son [had suffered].  And she brought her
possessions as the penalty for not having opened the door to me.  Oh
the child shall live and the poison die!  Verily Horus shall be in good
case for his mother Isis.  Verily everyone who is stricken shall be in
good case likewise.


Lo, a bread-cake [made] of barley meal shall drive out (or, destroy)
the poison, and natron shall make it to withdraw, and the fire [made]
of hetchet-plant shall drive out (or, destroy) fever-heat from the
limbs.


"O Isis, O Isis, come thou to thy Horus, O thou woman of the wise
mouth!  Come to thy son"--thus cried the gods who dwelt in her quarter
of the town--"for he is as one whom a scorpion hath stung, and like
one whom the scorpion Uhat, which the animal Antesh drove away, hath
wounded."


[Then] Isis ran out like one who had a knife [stuck] in her body, and
she opened her arms wide, [saying] "Behold me, behold me, my son Horus,
have no fear, have no fear, O son my glory!  No evil thing of any kind
whatsoever shall happen unto thee, [for] there is in thee the essence
(or, fluid) which made the things which exist.  Thou art the son from
the country of Mesqet,[FN#216] [thou hast] come forth from the
celestial waters Nu, and thou shalt not die by the heat of the poison.
Thou wast the Great Bennu,[FN#217] who art born (or, produced) or; the
top of the balsam-trees[FN#218] which are in the House of the Aged One
in Anu (Heliopolis).  Thou art the brother of the Abtu Fish,[FN#219]
who orderest what is to be, and art the nursling of the Cat[FN#220] who
dwelleth in the House of Neith.  The goddess Reret,[FN#221] the goddess
Hat, and the god Bes protect thy members.  Thy head shall not fall to
the Tchat fiend that attacketh thee.  Thy members shall not receive the
fire of that which is thy poison.  Thou shalt not go backwards on the
land, and thou shalt not be brought low on the water.  No reptile which
biteth (or, stingeth) shall gain the mastery over thee, and no lion
shall subdue thee or have dominion over thee.  Thou art the son of the
sublime god 82 who proceeded from Keb.  Thou art Horus, and the poison
shall not gain the mastery over thy members.  Thou art the son of the
sublime god who proceeded from Keb, and thus likewise shall it be with
those who are under the knife.  And the four august goddesses shall
protect thy members."


[FN#216]  Mesqet was originally the name of the bull's skin in which
the deceased was wrapped in order to secure for him the now life; later
the name was applied to the Other World generally.  {See Book of the
Dead, Chap. xvii. 121.}

[FN#217]  The Bennu who kept the book of destiny. See Book of the Dead,
Chap. xvii. 25.

[FN#218]  These are the balsam-trees for which Heliopolis has been
always famous.  They are described by Wansleben, L'Histoire de
l'Eglise, pp. 88-93, and by 'Abd al-Latif (ed. de Sacy), p. 88.

[FN#219]  The Abtu and Ant Fishes swam before the Boat of Ra and guided
it.

[FN#220]  This is the Cat who lived by the Persea tree in Heliopolis.
See Book of the Dead, Chap. xvii. 18.

[FN#221]  A hippopotamus goddess.


[Here the narrative is interrupted by the following texts:]

[I am] he who rolleth up into the sky, and who goeth down (i.e.,
setteth) in the Tuat, whose form is in the House of height, through
whom when he openeth his Eye the light cometh into being, and when he
closeth his Eye it becometh night.  [I am] the Water-god Het when he
giveth commands, whose name is unknown to the gods.  I illumine the Two
Lands, night betaketh itself to flight, and I shine by day and by
night.[FN#222]  I am the Bull of Bakha[FN#223], and the Lion of
Manu[FN#224].  I am he who traverseth the heavens by day and by night
without being repulsed.  I have come 85 by reason of the voice (or,
cry) of the son of Isis.  Verily the blind serpent Na hath bitten the
Bull.  O thou poison which floweth through every member of him that is
under the knife, come forth, I charge thee, upon the ground.  Behold,
he that is under the knife shall not be bitten.  Thou art Menu, the
Lord of Coptos, the child of the White Shat[FN#225] which is in Anu
(Heliopolis), which was bitten [by a reptile].  O Menu, Lord of Coptos,
give thou air unto him that is under the knife; and air shall be given
to thee.  Hail, divine father and minister of the god Nebun, [called]
Mer-Tem, son of the divine father and minister of the god Nebun, scribe
of the Water-god Het, [called] Ankh-Semptek (sic), son of the lady of
the house Tent-Het-nub!  He restored this inscription after he had
found it in a ruined state in the Temple of Osiris-Mnevis, because he
wished to make to live her name . . . . . . . . . . and to give air
unto him that is under [the knife], and to give life unto the ancestors
of all the gods.  And his Lord Osiris-Mnevis shall make long his life
with happiness of heart, [and shall give him] a beautiful burial after
[attaining to] an old age, because of what he hath done for the Temple
of Osiris-Mnevis.


[FN#222]  i.e., always.

[FN#223]  The land of the sunrise, the East.


[FN#224]  The land of the sunset, the West.


[FN#225] Perhaps an animal of the Lynx class.


89. Horus was bitten (i.e., stung) in Sekhet-An, to the north of Hetep-
hemt, whilst his mother Isis was in the celestial houses making a
libation for her brother Osiris.  And Horus sent forth his cry into the
horizon, and it was heard by those who were in . . . . . .  Thereupon
the keepers of the doors who were in the [temple of] the holy Acacia
Tree started up at the voice of Horus.  And one sent forth a cry of
lamentation, and Heaven gave the order that Horus was to be healed.
And [the gods] took counsel [together] concerning the life [of Horus,
saying,] "O goddess Pai(?), O god Asten, who dwellest in Aat-Khus(?)
. . . . .[FN#226] thy . . . . . . enter in . . . . . lord of sleep . .
. . . . the child Horus.  Oh, Oh, bring thou the things which are thine
to cut off the poison which is in every member of Horus, the son of
Isis, and which is in every member of him that is under the knife
likewise."


[FN#226]  The text appears to be corrupt in this passage.


101. A HYMN OF PRAISE TO HORUS TO GLORIFY HIM, WHICH IS TO BE SAID 102
OVER THE WATERS AND OVER THE LAND.


Thoth speaketh and this god reciteth [the following]:--


"Homage to thee, god, son of a god.  Homage to thee, heir, son of an
heir.  Homage to thee, bull, son of a bull, who wast brought forth by a
holy goddess.  Homage to thee, Horus, who comest forth from Osiris, and
wast brought forth by the goddess Isis.  I recite thy words of power, I
speak with thy magical utterance.  I pronounce a spell in thine own
words, which thy heart hath created, and all the spells and
incantations which have come forth from thy mouth, which thy father Keb
commanded thee [to recite], and thy mother Nut gave to thee, and the
majesty of the Governor of Sekhem taught thee to make use of for thy
protection, in order to double (or, repeat) thy protective formulae, to
shut the mouth of every reptile which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and in the waters, to make men and women to live, to make the gods to
be at peace [with thee], and to make Ra to employ his magical spells
through thy chants of praise.  Come to me this day, quickly, quickly,
as thou workest the paddle of the Boat of the god.  Drive thou away
from me every lion on the plain, and every crocodile in the waters, and
all mouths which bite (or, sting) in their holes.  Make thou them
before me like the stone of the mountain, like a broken pot lying about
in a quarter of the town.  Dig thou out from me the poison which riseth
and is in every member of him that is under the knife.  Keep thou watch
over him . . . . . . by means of thy words.  Verily let thy name be
invoked this day.  Let thy power (qefau) come into being in him.  Exalt
thou thy magical powers.  Make me to live and him whose throat is
closed up.  Then shall mankind give thee praise, and the righteous (?)
shall give thanks unto thy forms.  And all the gods likewise shall
invoke thee, and in truth thy name shall be invoked this day.  I am
Horus [of] Shet[enu] (?).


"O thou who art in the cavern,[FN#227] O thou who art in the cavern. O
thou who art at the mouth of the cavern.  O thou who art on the way, O
thou who art on the way.  O thou who art at the mouth of the way.  He
is Urmer (Mnevis) who approacheth every man and every beast.  He is
like the god Sep who is in Anu (Heliopolis).  He is the Scorpion-[god]
who is in the Great House (Het-ur).  Bite him not, for he is Ra.  Sting
him not, for he is Thoth.  Shoot ye not your poison over him, for he is
Nefer-Tem.  O every male serpent, O every female serpent, O every
antesh (scorpion?) which bite with your mouths, and sting with your
tails, bite ye him not with your mouths, and sting ye him not with your
tails.  Get ye afar off from him, make ye not your fire to be against
him, for he is the son of Osiris.  Vomit ye. [Say] four times:--

"I am Thoth, I have come from heaven to make protection of Horus, and
to drive away the poison of the scorpion which is in every member of
Horus.  Thy head is to thee, Horus; it shall be stable under the Urert
Crown.  Thine eye is to thee, Horus, [for] thou art Horus, the son of
Keb, the Lord of the Two Eyes, in the midst of the Company [of the
gods].  Thy nose is to thee, Horus, [for] thou art Horus the Elder, the
son of Ra, and thou shalt not inhale the fiery wind.  Thine arm is to
thee, Horus, great is thy strength to slaughter the enemies of thy
father.  Thy two thighs[FN#228] are to thee, Horus.  Receive thou the
rank and dignity of thy father Osiris.  Ptah hath balanced for thee thy
mouth on the day of thy birth.  Thy heart (or, breast) is to thee,
Horus, and the Disk maketh thy protection.  Thine eye is to thee,
Horus; thy right eye is like Shu, and thy left eye like Tefnut, who are
the children of Ra.  Thy belly is to thee, Horus, and the Children are
the gods who are therein, and they shall not receive the essence (or,
fluid) of the scorpion.  Thy strength is to thee, Horus, and the
strength of Set shall not exist against thee.  Thy phallus is to thee,
Horus, and thou art Kamutef, the protector of his father, who maketh an
answer for his children in the course of every day.  Thy thighs are to
thee, Horus, and thy strength shall slaughter the enemies of thy
father.  Thy calves are to thee, Horus; the god Khnemu hath builded
[them], and the goddess Isis hath covered them with flesh.  The soles
of thy feet are to thee, Horus, and the nations who fight with the bow
(Peti) fall under thy feet.  Thou rulest the South, North, West, and
East, and thou seest like Ra. [Say] four times.  And likewise him that
is under the knife."


[FN#227]  Or, den or hole.

[FN#228]  We ought, perhaps, to translate this as "forearms."


Beautiful god, Senetchem-ab-Ra-setep-[en]-Amen, son of Ra, Nekht-Heru-
Hebit, thou art protected, and the gods and goddesses are protected,
and conversely.  Beautiful god, Senetchem-ab-Ra-setep-[en]-Ra, son of
Ra, Nekht-Heru-Hebit, thou art protected, and Heru-Shet[enu], the great
god, is protected, and conversely.


ANOTHER CHAPTER LIKE UNTO IT.  "Fear not, fear not, O Bast, the strong
of heart, at the head of the holy field, the mighty one among all the
gods, nothing shall gain the mastery over thee.  Come thou outside,
following my speech (or, mouth), O evil poison which is in all the
members of the lion (or, cat) which is under the knife."


[The narrative of the stinging of Horus by a scorpion is continued
thus]:


"I am Isis, who conceived a child by her husband, and she became heavy
with Horus, the divine [child].  I gave birth to Horus, the son of
Osiris, in a nest of papyrus plants.[FN#229]  I rejoiced exceedingly
over this, because I saw [in him one] who would make answer for his
father.  I hid him, and I concealed him through fear of that [fiend
(?)].[FN#230]  I went away to the city of Am, [where] the people gave
thanks [for me] through [their] fear of my making trouble [for them].
I passed the day in seeking to provide food for the child, [and] on
returning to take Horus into my arms I found him, Horus, the beautiful
one of gold, the boy, the child, without [life].  He had bedewed the
ground with the water of his eye, and with foam from his lips.  His
body was motionless, his heart was powerless to move, and the sinews
(or, muscles) of his members were [helpless].  I sent forth a cry,
[saying]:


[FN#229]  Or, Ateh, the papyrus swamp.


[FN#230]  i.e., Set.


"'I, even I, lack a son to make answer [for me].[FN#231]  [My] two
breasts are full to overflowing, [but] my body is empty.  [My] mouth
wished for that which concerned him.[FN#232]  A cistern of water and a
stream of the inundation was I. The child was the desire of my heart,
and I longed to protect him (?). I carried him in my womb, I gave birth
to him, I endured the agony of the birth pangs, I was all alone, and
the great ones were afraid of disaster and to come out at the sound of
my voice.  My father is in the Tuat,[FN#233] my mother is in
Aqert,[FN#234] and my elder brother is in the sarcophagus.  Think of
the enemy and of how prolonged was the wrath of his heart against me,
[when] I, the great lady, was in his house.'


[FN#231]  i.e., to be my advocate.


[FN#232]  Literally "his thing."


[FN#233]  Tuat is a very ancient name of the Other World, which was
situated either parallel with Egypt or across the celestial ocean which
surrounded the world.


[FN#234]  The "perfect place," i.e., the Other World.


"I cried then, [saying,] 'Who among the people will indeed let their
hearts come round to me?'  I cried then to those who dwelt in the
papyrus swamps (or, Ateh), and they inclined to me straightway.  And
the people came forth to me from their houses, and they thronged about
me at [the sound of] my voice, and they loudly bewailed with me the
greatness of my affliction.  There was no man there who set restraint
(?) on his mouth, every person among them lamented with great
lamentation.  There was none there who knew how to make [my child] to
live.


"And there came forth unto me a woman who was [well] known in her city,
a lady who was mistress of her [own] estate.[FN#235]  She came forth to
me.  Her mouth possessed life, and her heart was filled with the matter
which was therein, [and she said,] 'Fear not, fear not, O son Horus!
Be not cast down, be not cast down, O mother of the god.  The child of
the Olive-tree is by the mountain of his brother, the bush is hidden,
and no enemy shall enter therein.  The word of power of Tem, the Father
of the gods, who is in heaven, maketh to live.  Set shall not enter
into this region, he shall not go round about it.  The marsh of Horus
of the Olive-tree is by the mountain of his brother; those who are in
his following shall not at any time . . . . . . it.  This shall happen
to him: Horus shall live for his mother, and shall salute (?) [her]
with his mouth. A scorpion hath smitten (i.e., stung) him, and the
reptile Aun-ab hath wounded him.'"


[FN#235]  Or perhaps, "a lady who was at the head of her district."


Then Isis placed her nose in his mouth[FN#236] so that she might know
whether he who was in his coffin breathed, and she examined the
wound[FN#237] of the heir of the god, and she found that there was
poison in it.  She threw her arms round him, and then quickly she
leaped about with him like fish when they are laid upon the hot coals,
[saying]:


[FN#236]  i.e., the mouth of Horus.


[FN#237]  Literally, "pain" or "disease."


"Horus is bitten, O Ra.  Thy son is bitten, [O Osiris].  Horus is
bitten, the flesh and blood of the Heir, the Lord of the diadems (?) of
the kingdoms of Shu.  Horus is bitten, the Boy of the marsh city of
Ateh, the Child in the House of the Prince.  The beautiful Child of
gold is bitten, the Babe hath suffered pain and is not.[FN#238]  Horus
is bitten, he the son of Un-Nefer, who was born of Auh-mu (?).  Horus
is bitten, he in whom there was nothing abominable, the son, the youth
among the gods.  Horus is bitten, he for whose wants I prepared in
abundance, for I saw that he would make answer[FN#239] for his father.
Horus is bitten, he for whom [I] had care [when he was] in the hidden
woman [and for whom I was afraid when he was] in the womb of his
mother.  Horus is bitten, he whom I guarded to look upon.  I have
wished for the life of his heart.  Calamity hath befallen the child on
the water, and the child hath perished."


[FN#238]  He is nothing, i.e., he is dead.

[FN#239]  i.e., become an advocate for.


Then came Nephthys shedding tears and uttering cries of lamentation, and
going round about through the papyrus swamps.  And Serq [came also and
they said]: "Behold, behold, what hath happened to Horus, son of Isis,
and who [hath done it]? Pray then to heaven, and let the mariners of Ra
cease their labours for a space, for the Boat of Ra cannot travel
onwards [whilst] son Horus [lieth dead] on his place."

And Isis sent forth her voice into heaven, and made supplication to the
Boat of Millions of Years, and the Disk stopped[FN#240] in its
journeying, and moved not from the place whereon it rested.  Then came
forth Thoth, who is equipped with his spells (or, words of power), and
possesseth the great word of command of maa-kheru,[FN#241] [and said:]
"What [aileth thee], what [aileth thee], O Isis, thou goddess who hast
magical spells, whose mouth hath understanding?  Assuredly no evil
thing hath befallen [thy] son Horus, [for] the Boat of Ra hath him
under its protection.  I have come this day in the Divine Boat of the
Disk from the place where it was yesterday,--now darkness came and the
light was destroyed--in order to heal Horus for his mother Isis and
every person who is under the knife likewise."


[FN#240]  Literally, "alighted."


[FN#241]  When a god or a man was declared to be maa-kheru, "true of
voice," or "true of word," his power became illimitable.  It gave him
rule and authority, and every command uttered by him was immediately
followed by the effect required.


And Isis, the goddess, said: "O Thoth, great things [are in] thy heart,
[but] delay belongeth to thy plan.  Hast thou come equipped with thy
spells and incantations, and having the great formula of maa-kheru, and
one [spell] after the other, the numbers whereof are not known?  Verily
Horus is in the cradle(?) of the poison.  Evil, evil is his case,
death, [and] misery to the fullest [extent].  The cry of his mouth is
towards his mother(?).  I cannot [bear] to see these things in his
train.  My heart [hath not] rested because of them since the
beginning(?) [when] I made haste to make answer [for] Horus-Ra (?),
placing [myself] on the earth, [and] since the day [when] I was taken
possession of by him. I desired Neheb-ka . . . . . . ."

[And Thoth said:] "Fear not, fear not, O goddess Isis, fear not, fear
not, O Nephthys, and let not anxiety [be to you].  I have come from
heaven having life to heal(?) the child for his mother, Horus is . . .
Let thy heart be firm;[FN#242] he shall not sink under the flame.
Horus is protected as the Dweller in his Disk,[FN#243] who lighteth up
the Two Lands by the splendour of his two Eyes;[FN#244] and he who is
under the knife is likewise protected.  Horus is protected as the
First-born son in heaven,[FN#245] who is ordained to be the guide of
the things which exist and of the things which are not yet created; and
he who under the knife is protected likewise.  Horus is protected as
that great Dwarf (nemu)[FN#246] who goeth round about the Two Lands in
the darkness; and he who is under the knife is protected likewise.
Horus is protected as the Lord (?) in the night, who revolveth at the
head of the Land of the Sunset (Manu); and he who is under the knife is
protected likewise.  Horus is protected as the Mighty Ram[FN#247] who
is hidden, and who goeth round about in front of his Eyes; and he who
is under the knife is protected likewise.  Horus is protected as the
Great Hawk[FN#248] which flieth through heaven, earth, and the Other
World (Tuat); and he who is under the knife is protected likewise.
Horus is protected as the Holy Beetle, the mighty (?) wings of which
are at the head of the sky;[FN#249] and he who is under the knife is
protected likewise.  Horus is protected as the Hidden Body,[FN#250] and
as he whose mummy is in his sarcophagus; and he who is under the knife
is protected likewise.  Horus is protected [as the Dweller] in the
Other World [and in the] Two Lands, who goeth round about 'Those who
are over Hidden Things'; and he who is under the knife is protected
likewise.  Horus is protected as the Divine Bennu[FN#251] who alighteth
in front of his two Eyes; and he who is under the knife is protected
likewise.  Horus is protected 230 in his own body, and the spells which
his mother Isis hath woven protect him.  Horus is protected by the
names of his father [Osiris] in his forms in the nomes;[FN#252] and he
who is under the knife is protected likewise.  Horus is protected by
the weeping of his mother, and by the cries of grief of his brethren;
and he who is under the knife is protected likewise.  Horus is
protected by his own name and heart, and the gods go round about him to
make his funeral bed; and he who is under the knife is protected
likewise."

[FN#244]  The Sun and Moon.

of the Book of the Dead.


[And Thoth said:]

"Wake up, Horus!  Thy protection is established.  Make thou happy the
heart of thy mother Isis.  The words of Horus shall bind up hearts, he
shall cause to be at peace him who is in affliction.  Let your hearts
be happy, O ye who dwell in the heavens (Nut).  Horus, he who hath
avenged (or, protected) his father shall cause the poison to retreat.
Verily that which is in the mouth of Ra shall go round about (i.e.,
circulate), and the tongue of the Great God shall repulse
[opposition].  The Boat [of Ra] standeth still, and travelleth not
onwards.  The Disk is in the [same] place where it was yesterday to
heal Horus for his mother Isis, and to heal him that is under the knife
of his mother[FN#253] likewise.  Come to the earth, draw nigh, O Boat
of Ra, make the boat to travel, O mariners of heaven, transport
provisions (?) of . . . . . . Sekhem[FN#254] to heal Horus for his
mother Isis, and to heal him that is under the knife of his mother
likewise.  Hasten away, O pain which is in the region round about, and
let it (i.e., the Boat) descend upon the place where it was yesterday
to heal Horus for his mother Isis, and to heal him that is under the
knife of his mother likewise.  Get thee round and round, O bald (?)
fiend, without horns at the seasons (?), not seeing the forms through
the shadow of the two Eyes, to heal Horus for his mother Isis, and to
heal him that is under the knife likewise.  Be filled, O two halves of
heaven, be empty, O papyrus roll, return, O life, into the living to
heal Horus for his it mother Isis, and to heal him that is under the
knife likewise.  Come thou to earth, O poison.  Let hearts be glad, and
let radiance (or, light) go round about.


[FN#253]  We should probably strike out the words "of his mother."

[FN#254]  The city in the Delta called by the Greeks Letopolis.


"I am Thoth,[FN#255] the firstborn son, the son of Ra, and Tem and the
Company of the gods have commanded me to heal Horus for his mother
Isis, and to heal him that is under the knife likewise.  O Horus, O
Horus, thy Ka protecteth thee, and thy Image worketh protection for
thee.  The poison is as the daughter of its [own] flame; [it is]
destroyed [because] it smote the strong son.  Your temples are in good
condition for you, [for] Horus liveth for his mother, and he who is
under the knife likewise."


[FN#255]  Thoth stood by during the fight between Horus and Set, and
healed the wounds which they inflicted on each other.


And the goddess Isis said:


"Set thou his face towards those who dwell in the North Land (Ateh),
the nurses who dwell in the city Pe-Tept (Buto), for they have offered
very large offerings in order to cause the child to be made strong for
his mother, and to make strong him that is under the knife likewise.
Do not allow them to recognize the divine Ka in the Swamp Land, in the
city (?) of Nemhettu (?) [and] in her city."


Then spake Thoth unto the great gods who dwell in the Swamp-Land
[saying]: "O ye nurses who dwell in the city of Pe, who smite [fiends]
with your hands, and overthrow [them] with your arms on behalf of that
Great One who appeareth in front of you [in] the Sektet Boat,[FN#256]
let the Matet[FN#257] (Mantchet) Boat travel on.  Horus is to you, he
is counted up for life, and he is declared for the life of his father
[Osiris].  I have given gladness unto those who are in the Sektet Boat,
and the mariners [of Ra] make it to journey on.  Horus liveth for his
mother Isis and he who is under the knife liveth for his mother
likewise.  As for the poison, the strength thereof has been made
powerless.  Verily I am a favoured one, and I will join myself to his
hour[FN#258] to hurl back the report of evil to him that sent it forth.
The heart of Ra-Heru-Khuti rejoiceth.  Thy son Horus is counted up for
life [which is] on this child to make him to smite, and to retreat (?)
from those who are above, and to turn back the paths of the Sebiu
fiends from him, so that he may take possession of the throne of the
Two Lands.  Ra is in heaven to make answer on 251 behalf of him and his
father.  The words of power of his mother have lifted up his face, and
they protect him and enable him to go round about wheresoever he
pleaseth, and to set the terror of him in celestial beings.  I have
made haste . . . . . ."


[FN#256]  The boat in which Ra travelled from noon to sunset, or
perhaps until midnight.


[FN#257]  The boat in which Ra travelled from dawn, or perhaps from
midnight, to noon.

[FN#258]  i.e., I will be with him at the moment of his need.


THE HISTORY OF ISIS AND OSIRIS,


WITH EXPLANATIONS OF THE SAME, COLLECTED BY PLUTARCH, AND SUPPLEMENTED
BY HIS OWN VIEWS.


I.  Though it be the wise man's duty, O Clea,[FN#259] to apply to the
gods for every good thing which he hopes to enjoy, yet ought he more
especially to pray to them for their assistance in his search after
that knowledge which more immediately regards themselves, as far as
such knowledge may be attained, inasmuch as there is nothing which they
can bestow more truly beneficial to mankind, or more worthy themselves,
than truth.  For whatever other good things are indulged to the wants
of men, they have all, properly speaking, no relation to, and are of a
nature quite different from, that of their divine donors.  For 'tis not
the abundance of their gold and silver, nor the command of the thunder,
but wisdom and knowledge which constitute the power and happiness of
those heavenly beings.  It is therefore well observed by Homer (Iliad,
xiii. 354), and indeed with more propriety than be usually talks of the
gods, when, speaking of Zeus and Poseidon, he tells us that both were
descended from the same parents, and born in the same region, but that
Zeus was the elder and knew most; plainly intimating thereby that the
empire of the former was more august and honourable than that of his
brother, as by means of his age he was his superior, and more advanced
in wisdom and science.  Nay, 'tis my opinion, I own, that even the
blessedness of that eternity which is the portion of the Deity himself
consists in that universal knowledge of all nature which accompanies
it; for setting this aside, eternity might be more properly styled an
endless duration than an enjoyment of existence.


[FN#259]  She is said to have been a priestess of Isis and of Apollo
Delphicus.


II.  To desire, therefore, and covet after truth, those truths more
especially which concern the divine nature, is to aspire to be
partakers of that nature itself, and to profess that all our studies
and inquiries are devoted to the acquisition of holiness.  This
occupation is surely more truly religious than any external
purifications or mere service of the temple can be.  But more
especially must such a disposition of mind be highly acceptable to that
goddess to whose service you are dedicated, for her especial
characteristics are wisdom and foresight, and her very name seems to
express the peculiar relation which she bears to knowledge.  For
"Isis"[FN#260] is a Greek word, and means "knowledge," and
"Typhon,"[FN#261] the name of her professed adversary, is also a Greek
word, and means "pride and insolence."  This latter name is well
adapted to one who, full of ignorance and error, tears in pieces and
conceals that holy doctrine which the goddess collects, compiles, and
delivers to those who aspire after the most perfect participation in
the divine nature.  This doctrine inculcates a steady perseverance in
one uniform and temperate course of life, and an abstinence from
particular kinds of foods, as well as from all indulgence of the carnal
appetite, and it restrains the intemperate and voluptuous part within
due bounds, and at the same time habituates her votaries to undergo
those austere and rigid ceremonies which their religion obliges them to
observe.  The end and aim of all these toils and labours is the
attainment of the knowledge of the First and Chief Being, who alone is
the object of the understanding of the mind; and this knowledge the
goddess invites us to seek after, as being near and dwelling
continually with her.  And this also is what the very name of her
temple promiseth to us, that is to say, the knowledge and understanding
of the eternal and self-existent Being (tou ontas)-now, it is called
"Iseion," which suggests that if we approach the temple of the goddess
rightly, and with purity, we shall obtain the knowledge of that eternal
and self-existent Being (to on).


[FN#260]  The Egyptian form of the name is As-T, ####, ####, or ####.
Plutarch wishes to derive the name from some form of {greek oida}.

[FN#261]  In Egyptian, Tebh.


III.  The goddess Isis is said by some authors to be the
daughter[FN#262] of Hermes, [FN#263] and by others of Prometheus, both
of them famous for their philosophic turn of mind.  The latter is
supposed to have first taught mankind wisdom and foresight, as the
former is reputed to have invented letters and music.


[FN#262]  According to the Egyptian Heliopolitan doctrine, Isis was the
daughter of Keb, the Earth-god, and Nut, the Sky-goddess; she was the
wife of Osiris, mother of Horus, and sister of Set and Nephthys.

[FN#263]  The Egyptian. Tehuti, or Thoth, who invented letters,
mathematics, &c.  He was the "heart of Ra," the scribe of the gods, and
he uttered the words which created the world; he composed the "words of
power," or magical formulae which were beneficial for the dead, and the
religious works which were used by souls in their journey from this
world to the next.


They likewise call the former of the two Muses at Hermopolis[FN#264]
Isis as well as Dikaiosune,[FN#265] she being none other, it is said,
than Wisdom pointing out the knowledge of divine truths to her
votaries, the true Hierophori and Hierostoli.  Now, by the former of
these are meant such who carry about them looked up in their souls, as
in a chest, the sacred doctrine concerning the gods, purified from all
such superfluities as superstition may have added thereto.  And the
holy apparel with which the Hierostoli adorn the statues of these
deities, which is partly of a dark and gloomy and partly of a more
bright and shining colour, seems aptly enough to represent the notions
which this doctrine teaches us to entertain of the divine nature
itself, partly clear and partly obscure.  And inasmuch as the devotees
of Isis after their decease are wrapped up in these sacred vestments,
is not this intended to signify that this holy doctrine still abides
with them, and that this alone accompanies them in another life?  For
as 'tis not the length of the beard or the coarseness of the habit
which makes a philosopher, so neither will these frequent shavings, or
the mere wearing of a linen vestment, constitute a votary of Isis.  He
alone is a true servant or follower of this goddess who, after he has
heard, and has been made acquainted in a proper manner with the history
of the actions of these gods, searches into the hidden truths which lie
concealed under them, and examines the whole by the dictates of reason
and philosophy.


[FN#264]  The Hermopolis here referred to is the city of Khemenu in
Upper Egypt, wherein was the great sanctuary of Thoth.

[FN#265]  i.e., Righteousness, or Justice.  The goddess referred to is
probably Maat.


IV.  Nor, indeed, ought such an examination to be looked on as
unnecessary whilst there are so many ignorant of the true reason even
of the most ordinary rites observed by the Egyptian priests, such as
their shavings[FN#266] and wearing linen garments.  Some, indeed, there
are who never trouble themselves to think at all about these matters,
whilst others rest satisfied with the most superficial accounts of
them: "They pay a peculiar veneration to the sheep,[FN#267] therefore
they think it their duty not only to abstain from eating its flesh, but
likewise from wearing its wool.  They are continually mourning for
their gods, therefore they shave themselves.  The light azure blossom
of the flax resembles the clear and bloomy colour of the ethereal sky,
therefore they wear linen"; whereas the true reason of the institution
and observation of these rites is but one, and that common to all of
them, namely, the extraordinary notions which they entertain of
cleanliness, persuaded as they are, according to the saying of Plato,
"none but the pure ought to approach the pure."  Now, no superfluity of
our food, and no excrementitious substance, is looked upon by them as
pure and clean; such, however, are all kinds of wool and down, our hair
and our nails.  It would be the highest absurdity, therefore, for those
who, whilst; they are in a course of purification, are at so much pains
to take off the hair from every part of their own bodies, at the same
time to clothe themselves with that of other animals.  So when we are
told by Hesiod "not to pare our nails whilst we are present at the
festivals of the gods,"[FN#268] we ought to understand that he intended
hereby to inculcate that purity wherewith we ought to come prepared
before we enter upon any religious duty, that we have not to make
ourselves clean whilst we ought to be occupied in attending to the
solemnity itself.  Now, with regard to flax, this springs out of the
immortal earth itself; and not only produces a fruit fit for food, but
moreover furnishes a light and neat sort of clothing, extremely
agreeable to the wearer, adapted to all the seasons of the year, and
not in the least subject, as is said, to produce or nourish vermin; but
more of this in another place.


[FN#266]  A rubric in the papyrus of Nes-Menu in the British Museum
orders the priestesses of Isis and Nephthys to have "the hair of their
bodies shaved off" (No. 10,188, col. 1), but they are also ordered to
wear fillets of rams' wool on their heads.

[FN#267]  Probably the ram of Amen. Animal sacrifices were invariably
bulls and cows.


[FN#268]  This saying is by Pythagoras--{greek Para dusian
mh`onuxizou}.  The saying of Hesiod (Works and Days, 740) is rendered
by Goodwin:--


"Not at a feast of Gods from five-branched tree,
With sharp-edged steel to part the green from dry."


V.  Now, the priests are so scrupulous in endeavouring to avoid
everything which may tend to the increase of the above-mentioned
excrementitious substances, that, on this account, they abstain not
only from most sorts of pulse, and from the flesh of sheep and swine,
but likewise, in their more solemn purifications, they even exclude
salt from their meals.  This they do for many reasons, but chiefly
because it whets their appetites, and incites them to eat more than
they otherwise would.  Now, as to salt being accounted impure because,
as Aristagoras tells us, many little insects are caught in it whilst it
is hardening, and are thereby killed therein-this view is wholly
trifling and absurd.  From these same motives also they give the Apis
Bull his water from a well specially set apart for the purpose,[FN#269]
and they prevent him altogether from drinking of the Nile, not indeed
that they regard the river as impure, and polluted because of the
crocodiles which are in it, as some pretend, for there is nothing which
the Egyptians hold in greater veneration than the Nile, but because its
waters are observed to be particularly nourishing[FN#270] and
fattening.  And they strive to prevent fatness in Apis as well as in
themselves, for they are anxious that their bodies should sit as light
and easy about their souls as possible, and that their mortal part
should not oppress and weigh down the divine and immortal.


[FN#269]  It is quite possible that Apis drank from a special well, but
the water in it certainly came from the Nile by infiltration.  In all
the old wells at Memphis the water sinks as the Nile sinks, and rises
as it rises.

[FN#270]  On account of the large amount of animal matter contained in
it.


VI. The priests of the Sun at Heliopolis[FN#271] never carry wine into
their temples, for they regard it as indecent for those who are devoted
to the service of any god to indulge in the drinking of wine whilst
they are under the immediate inspection of their Lord and King.[FN#272]
The priests of the other deities are not so scrupulous in this respect,
for they use it, though sparingly.  During their more solemn
purifications they abstain from wine wholly, and they give themselves
up entirely to study and meditation, and to the hearing and teaching of
those divine truths which treat of the divine nature.  Even the kings,
who are likewise priests, only partake of wine in the measure which is
prescribed for them in the sacred books, as we are told by Hecataeus.
This custom was only introduced during the reign of Psammetichus, and
before that time they drank no wine at all.  If they used it at any
time in pouring out libations to the gods, it was not because they
looked upon it as being acceptable to them for its own sake, but they
poured it out over their altars as the blood of their enemies who had
in times past fought against them.  For they believe the vine to have
first sprung out of the earth after it was fattened by the bodies of
those who fell in the wars against the gods.  And this, they say, is
the reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and
beside themselves, filling them, as it were, with the blood of their
own ancestors.  These things are thus related by Eudoxus in the second
book of his Travels, as he had them from the priests themselves.


[FN#271]  Called ANU in the Egyptian texts; it was the centre of the
great solar cult of Egypt.  It is the "On" of the Bible.

[FN#272]  The Sun-god was called Ra.


VII.  As to sea-fish, the Egyptians in general do not abstain from all
kinds of them, but some from one sort and some from another.  Thus, for
example, the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus[FN#273] will not touch any that
have been taken with an angle; for as they pay especial reverence to
the Oxyrhynchus Fish,[FN#274] from whence they derive their name, they
are afraid lest perhaps the hook may be defiled by having been at some
time or other employed in catching their favourite fish.  The people of
Syene[FN#275] in like manner abstain from the Phagrus Fish[FN#276]; for
as this fish is observed by them to make his first appearance upon
their coasts just as the Nile begins to overflow, they pay special
regard to these voluntary messengers as it were of that most joyful
news.  The priests, indeed, entirely abstain from all sorts in
general.[FN#277]  Therefore, upon the ninth day of the first month,
when all the rest of the Egyptians are obliged by their religion to eat
a fried fish before the door of their houses, they only burn them, not
tasting them at all.  For this custom they give two reasons: the first
and most curious, as falling in with the sacred philosophy of Osiris
and Typhon, will be more properly explained in another place.  The
second, that which is most obvious and manifest, is that fish is
neither a dainty nor even a necessary kind of food, a fact which seems
to be abundantly confirmed by the writings of Homer, who never makes
either the delicate Pheacians or the Ithacans (though both peoples were
islanders) to feed upon fish, nor even the companions of Ulysses during
their long and most tedious voyage, till they were reduced thereto by
extreme necessity.  In short, they consider the sea to have been forced
out of the earth by the power of fire, and therefore to lie out of
nature's confines; and they regard it not as a part of the world, or
one of the elements, but as a preternatural and corrupt and morbid
excrement.


[FN#273]  The Per-Matchet.

[FN#274]  Probably the pike, or "fighting fish."

[FN#275]  In Egyptian, SUNU, the Seweneh of the Bible, and the modern
Aswan.


[FN#276]  A kind of bream, the an of the Egyptian texts.

[FN#277]  Compare Chap. CXXXVIIA of the Book of the Dead.  "And behold,
these things shall be performed by a man who is clean, and is
ceremonially pure, one who hath eaten neither meat nor fish, and who
hath not had intercourse with women" (ll. 52, 53).


VIII.  This much may be depended upon: the, religious rites and
ceremonies of the Egyptians were never instituted upon irrational
grounds, never built upon mere fable and superstition, but founded with
a view to promote the morality and happiness of those who were to
observe them, or at least to preserve the memory of some valuable piece
of history, or to represent to us some of the phenomena of nature.  As
concerning the abhorrence which is expressed for onions, it is wholly
improbable that this detestation is owing to the loss of Diktys, who,
whilst he was under the guardianship of Isis, is supposed to have
fallen into the river and to have been drowned as he was reaching after
a bunch of them.  No, the true reason of their abstinence from onions
is because they are observed to flourish most and to be in the greatest
vigour at the wane of the moon, and also because they are entirely
useless to them either in their feasts[FN#278] or in their times of
abstinence and purification, for in the former case they make tears
come from those who use them, and in the latter they create thirst.
For much the same reason they likewise look upon the pig as an impure
animal, and to be avoided, observing it to be most apt to engender upon
the decrease of the moon, and they think that those who drink its milk
are more subject to leprosy and such-like cutaneous diseases than
others.  The custom of abstaining from the flesh of the pig[FN#279] is
not always observed, for those who sacrifice a sow to Typhon once a
year, at the full moon, afterwards eat its flesh. The reason they give
for this practice is this: Typhon being in pursuit of this animal at
that season of the moon, accidentally found the wooden chest wherein
was deposited the body of Osiris, which he immediately pulled to
pieces. This story, however, is not generally admitted, there being
some who look upon it, as they do many other relations of the same
kind, as founded upon some mistake or misrepresentation. All agree,
however, in saying that so great was the abhorrence which the ancient
Egyptians expressed for whatever tended to promote luxury, expense, and
voluptuousness, that in order to expose it as much as possible they
erected a column in one of the temples of Thebes, full of curses
against their king Meinis, who first drew them off from their former
frugal and parsimonious course of life.  The immediate cause for the
erection of the pillar is thus given: Technatis,[FN#280] the father of
Bocchoris, leading an army against the Arabians, and his baggage and
provisions not coming up to him as soon as he expected, was therefore
obliged to eat some of the very poor food which was obtainable, and
having eaten, he lay down on the bare ground and slept very soundly.
This gave him a great affection for a mean and frugal diet, and induced
him to curse the memory of Meinis, and with the permission of the
priests he made these curses public by cutting them upon a
pillar.[FN#281]


[FN#278]  Bunches of onions were offered to the dead at all periods of
Egyptian history, and they were regarded as typical of the "white
teeth" of Horus.  The onion was largely used in medicine.

[FN#279]  The pig was associated with Set, or Typhon, and the black
variety was specially abominated because it was a black pig which
struck Horus in the eye, and damaged it severely.  See Book of the
Dead, Chap. CXII.

[FN#280]  In Egyptian, TAFNEKHT, the first king of the XXIVth Dynasty.

[FN#281]  An unlikely story, for Tafnekht had no authority at Thebes.


IX.  Now, the kings of Egypt were always chosen either out of the
soldiery or priesthood, the former order being honoured and respected
for its valour, and the latter for its wisdom.  If the choice fell upon
a soldier, he was immediately initiated into the order of priests, and
by them instructed in their abstruse and hidden philosophy, a
philosophy for the most part involved in fable and allegory, and
exhibiting only dark hints and obscure resemblances of the truth.  This
the priesthood hints to us in many instances, particularly by the
sphinxes, which they seem to have placed designedly before their
temples as types of the enigmatical nature of their theology.  To this
purpose, likewise, is that inscription which they have engraved upon
the base of the statue of Athene[FN#282] at Sais, whom they identify
with Isis: "I am everything that has been, that is, and that shall be:
and my veil no man hath raised."  In like manner the word "Amoun," or
as it is expressed in the Greek language, "Ammon," which is generally
looked upon as the proper name of the Egyptian Zeus, is interpreted by
Manetho[FN#283] the Sebennite[FN#284] to signify "concealment" or
"something which is hidden."[FN#285]  Hecataeus of Abdera indeed tells
us that the Egyptians make use of this term when they call out to one
another.  If this be so, then their invoking Amoun is the same thing as
calling upon the supreme being, whom they believe to be "hidden" and
"concealed" in the universal nature, to appear and manifest itself to
them.  So cautious and reserved was the Egyptian wisdom in those things
which appertained to religion.


[FN#282]  The Egyptian goddess Net, in Greek {greek Nhid}, the great
goddess of Sais, in the Western Delta.  She was self-existent, and
produced her son, the Sun-god, without union with a god.  In an address
to her, quoted by Mallet (Culte de Neit, p. 140), are found the words,
"thy garment hath not been unloosed," thus Plutarch's quotation is
correct.

[FN#283]  He compiled a History of Egypt for Ptolemy II., and
flourished about B.C. 270; only the King-List from this work is
preserved.

[FN#284]  He was a native of the town of Sebennytus.

[FN#285]  Amen means "hidden," and AMEN is the "hidden god."


X.  And this is still farther evinced from those voyages which have
been made into Egypt by the wisest men among the Greeks, namely, by
Solo, Thales Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, even by
Lycurgus himself, on purpose to converse with the priests.  And we are
also told that Eudoxus was a disciple of Chnouphis the Memphite, Solo
of Sonchis the Saite, and Pythagoras of Oinuphis the Heliopolite.  But
none of these philosophers seems either to have been more admired and
in greater favour with the priests, or to have paid a more especial
regard to their method of philosophising, than this last named, who has
particularly imitated their mysterious and symbolical manner in his own
writings, and like them conveyed his doctrines to the world in a kind
of riddle.  For many of the precepts of Pythagoras come nothing short
of the hieroglyphical representations themselves, such as, "eat not in
a chariot," "sit not on a measure (choenix)," "plant not a palm-tree,"
and "stir not the fire with a sword in the house."  And I myself am of
the opinion that, when the Pythagoreans appropriated the names of
several of the gods to particular numbers, as that of Apollo to the
unit, of Artemis to the duad, of Athene to the seven, and of Poseidon
to the first cube, in this they allude to something which the founder
of their sect saw in the Egyptian temples, or to some ceremonies
performed in them, or to some symbols there exhibited.  Thus, their
great king and lord Osiris is represented by the hieroglyphics for an
eye and a sceptre,[FN#286] the name itself signifying "many-eyed," as
we are told by some[FN#287] who would derive it from the words
os,[FN#288] "many," and iri,[FN#289] an "eye," which have this meaning
in the Egyptian language.  Similarly, because the heavens are eternal
and are never consumed or wax old, they represent them by a heart with
a censer placed under it.  Much in the same way are those statues of
the Judges at Thebes without hands, and their chief, or president, is
represented with his eyes turned downwards, which signifies that
justice ought not to be obtainable by bribes, nor guided by favour or
affection.  Of a like nature is the Beetle which we see engraven upon
the seals of the soldiers, for there is no such thing as a female
beetle of this species; for they are all males, and they propagate
their kind by casting their seed into round balls of dirt, which afford
not only a proper place wherein the young may be hatched, but also
nourishment for them as soon as they are born.


[FN#286]  The oldest form of the name is As-Ar, ####; the first sign,
####, is a throne, and the second, ####, is an eye, but the exact
meaning represented by the two signs is not known.  In late times a
sceptre, #### took the place of the throne, but only because of its
phonetic value as or us.  Thus we have the forms #### and ####.

[FN#287]  This is a mistake.


[FN#288]  In Egyptian, #### ash, "many."

[FN#289]  In Egyptian, #### art, Coptic ####, "eye."


XI.  When you hear, therefore, the mythological tales which the
Egyptians tell of their gods, their wanderings, their mutilations, and
many other disasters which befell them, remember what has just been
said, and be assured that nothing of what is thus told you is really
true, or ever happened in fact.  For can it be imagined that it is the
dog[FN#290] itself which is reverenced by them under the name of
Hermes[FN#291]?  It is the qualities of this animal, his constant
vigilance, and his acumen in distinguishing his friends from his foes,
which have rendered him, as Plato says, a meet emblem of that god who
is the chief patron of intelligence.  Nor can we imagine that they
think that the sun, like a newly born babe, springs up every day out of
a lily.  It is quite true that they represent the rising sun in this
manner,[FN#292] but the reason is because they wish to indicate thereby
that it is moisture to which we owe the first kindling of this
luminary.  In like manner, the cruel and bloody king of Persia, Ochus,
who not only put to death great numbers of the people, but even slew
the Apis Bull himself, and afterwards served him up in a banquet to his
friends, is represented by them by a sword, and by this name he is
still to be found in the catalogue of their kings.  This name,
therefore, does not represent his person, but indicates his base and
cruel qualities, which were best suggested by the picture of an
instrument of destruction.  If, therefore, O Clea, you will hear and
entertain the story of these gods from those who know how to explain it
consistently with religion and philosophy, if you will steadily persist
in the observance of all these holy rites which the laws require of
you, and are moreover fully persuaded that to form true notions of the
divine nature is more acceptable to them than any sacrifice or mere
external act of worship can be, you will by this means be entirely
exempt from any danger of falling into superstition, an evil no less to
be avoided than atheism itself.


[FN#290]  The animal here referred to must be the dog-headed ape, ####,
which we see in pictures of the Judgment assisting Thoth to weigh the
heart of the dead.  This dog-headed ape is a wonderfully intelligent
creature, and its weird cleverness is astonishing.

[FN#291]  The Egyptian Tehuti, or Thoth.

[FN#292]  ####.


XII.  Now, the story of Isis and Osiris, its most insignificant and
superfluous parts being omitted, runs thus:--

The goddess Rhea,[FN#293] they say, having accompanied with
Kronos[FN#294] by stealth, was discovered by Helios[FN#295] who
straightway cursed her, and declared that she should not be delivered
in any month or year.  Hermes, however, 'being also in love with the
same goddess, in return for the favours which he had received from her,
went and played at dice with Selene,[FN#296] and won from her the
seventieth part of each day.  These parts he joined together and made
from them five complete days, and he added them to the three hundred
and sixty days of which the year formerly consisted.  These five days
are to this day called the "Epagomenae,"[FN#297] that is, the
superadded, and they are observed by them as the birthdays of their
gods.[FN#298]  On the first of these, they say, Osiris was born, and as
he came into the world a voice was heard saying, "The Lord of
All[FN#299] is born."  Some relate the matter in a different way, and
say that a certain person named Pamyles, as he was fetching water from
the temple of Dios at Thebes, heard a voice commanding him to proclaim
aloud that the good and great king Osiris was then born, and that for
this reason Kronos committed the education of the child to him, and
that in memory of this event the Pamylia were afterwards instituted,
which closely resemble the Phallephoria or Priapeia of the Greeks.
Upon the second of these days was born Aroueris,[FN#300] whom some call
Apollo, and others the Elder Horus.  Upon the third day Typhon was
born, who came into the world neither at the proper time nor by the
right way, but he forced a passage through a wound which he made in his
mother's side.  Upon the fourth day Isis was born, in the marshes of
Egypt,[FN#301] and upon the fifth day Nephthys, whom some call Teleute,
or Aphrodite, or Nike, was born.  As regards the fathers of these
children, the first two are said to have been begotten by Helios, Isis
by Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys by Kronos.  Therefore, since the
third of the superadded days was the birthday of Typhon, the kings
considered it to be unlucky,[FN#302] and in consequence they neither
transacted any business in it, nor even suffered themselves to take any
refreshment until the evening.  They further add that Typhon married
Nephthys,[FN#303] and that Isis and Osiris, having a mutual affection,
enjoyed each other in their mother's womb before they were born, and
that from this commerce sprang Aroueris, whom the Egyptians likewise
call Horus the Elder, and the Greeks Apollo.


[FN#293]  i.e., Nut, the Sky-goddess.

[FN#294]  i.e., Keb, the Earth-god.

[FN#295]  i.e., Ra.

[FN#296]  i.e., Aah.

[FN#297]  In Egyptian, "the five days over the year,"

[FN#298]  In Egyptian thus:--
I. Birthday of Osiris,
II. Birthday of Horus,
III. Birthday of Set,
IV. Birthday of Isis,
V. Birthday of Nephthys

[FN#299]  One of the chief titles of Osiris was Neb er tcher, i.e.,
"lord to the uttermost limit of everything."

[FN#300]  i.e., Heru-ur, "Horus the Elder."

[FN#301]  It was Horus, son of Isis, who was born in the marshes of
Egypt.

[FN#302]  This day is described as unlucky in the hieroglyphic texts.

[FN#303]  Set and Nephthys are regarded as husband and wife in the
texts; their offspring was Anubis, Anpu.


XIII.  Osiris having become king of Egypt, applied himself to
civilizing his countrymen by turning them from their former indigent
and barbarous course of life.  He taught them how to cultivate and
improve the fruits of the earth, and he gave them a body of laws
whereby to regulate their conduct, and instructed them in the reverence
and worship which they were to pay to the gods.  With the same good
disposition he afterwards travelled over the rest of the world,
inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, not indeed
compelling them by force of arms, but persuading them to yield to the
strength of his reasons, which were conveyed to them in the most
agreeable manner, in hymns and songs, accompanied with instruments of
music.  From this last circumstance the Greeks identified him with
their Dionysos, or Bacchus.  During the absence of Osiris from his
kingdom, Typhon had no opportunity of making any innovations in the
state, Isis being extremely vigilant in the government, and always upon
her guard.  After his return, however, having first persuaded seventy-
two other people to join with him in the conspiracy, together with a
certain queen of Ethiopia called Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at
that time, he formed a crafty plot against him.  For having privily
taken the measure of the body of Osiris, he caused a chest to be made
of exactly the same size, and it was very beautiful and highly
decorated.  This chest he brought into a certain banqueting room, where
it was greatly admired by all who were present, and Typhon, as if in
jest, promised to give it to that man whose body when tried would be
found to fit it.  Thereupon the whole company, one after the other,
went into it, but it did not fit any of them; last of all Osiris
himself lay down in it.  Thereupon all the conspirators ran to the
chest, and clapped the cover upon it, and then they fastened it down
with nails on the outside, and poured melted lead over it.  They next
took the chest to the river, which carried it to the sea through the
Tanaitic mouth of the Nile; and for this reason this mouth of the Nile
is still held in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and is never
mentioned by them except with marks of detestation.  These things, some
say, took place on the seventeenth day of the month of Hathor, when the
sun was in Scorpio, in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Osiris,
though others tell us that this was the year of his life and not of his
reign.


XIV.  The first who had knowledge of the accident which had befallen
their king were the Pans and Satyrs, who inhabited the country round
about Chemmis,[FN#304] and they having informed the people about it,
gave the first occasion to the name of Panic Terrors, which has ever
since been made use of to signify any sudden fright or amazement of a
multitude.  As soon as the report reached Isis, she immediately cut off
one of the locks of her hair, and put on mourning apparel in that very
place where she happened to be; for this reason the place has ever
since been called "Koptos," or the "city of mourning," though some are
of opinion that this word rather signifies "deprivation."  After this
she wandered round about through the country, being full of disquietude
and perplexity, searching for the chest, and she inquired of every
person she met, including some children whom she saw, whether they knew
what was become of it.  Now, it so happened that these children had
seen what Typhon's accomplices had done with the body, and they
accordingly told her by what mouth of the Nile it had been conveyed to
the sea.  For this reason the Egyptians look upon children as endued
with a kind of faculty of divining, and in consequence of this notion
are very curious in observing the accidental prattle which they have
with one another whilst they are at play, especially if it be in a
sacred place, forming omens and presages from it.  Isis meanwhile
having been informed that Osiris, deceived by her sister Nephthys, who
was in love with him, had unwittingly enjoyed her instead of herself,
as she concluded from the melilot-garland which he had left with her,
made it her business likewise to search out the child, the fruit of
this unlawful commerce (for her sister, dreading the anger of her
husband Typhon, had exposed it as soon as it was born).  Accordingly,
after much pains and difficulty, by means of some dogs that conducted
her to the place where it was, she found it and bred it up; and in
process of time it became her constant guard and attendant, and
obtained the name of Anubis, and it is thought that it watches and
guards the gods as dogs do men.


[FN#304]  In Egyptian, Khebt, in the VIIIth nome of Lower Egypt.


XV.  At length Isis received more particular news that the chest had
been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos, and there
gently lodged in the branches of a bush of tamarisk, which in a short
time had grown up into a large and beautiful tree, and had grown round
the chest and enclosed it on every side so completely that it was not
to be seen.  Moreover, the king of the country, amazed at its unusual
size, had cut the tree down, and made that part of the trunk wherein
the chest was concealed into a pillar to support the roof of his house.
These things, they say, having been made known to Isis in an
extraordinary manner by the report of demons, she immediately went to
Byblos, where, setting herself down by the side of a fountain, she
refused to speak to anybody except the queen's women who chanced to be
there.  These, however, she saluted and caressed in the kindest manner
possible, plaiting their hair for them, and transmitting into them part
of that wonderful odour which issued from her own body.  This raised a
great desire in the queen their mistress to see the stranger who had
this admirable faculty of transfusing so fragrant a smell from herself
into the hair and skin of other people.  She therefore sent for her to
court, and, after a further acquaintance with her, made her nurse to
one of her sons.  Now, the name of the king who reigned at this time at
Byblos was Melkander (Melkarth?), and that of his wife was Astarte, or,
according to others, Saosis, though some call her Nemanoun, which
answers to the Greek name Athenais.


XVI.  Isis nursed the child by giving it her finger to suck instead of
the breast.  She likewise put him each night into the fire in order to
consume his mortal part, whilst, having transformed herself into a
swallow, she circled round the pillar and bemoaned her sad fate.  This
she continued to do for some time, till the queen, who stood watching
her, observing the child to be all of a flame, cried out, and thereby
deprived him of some of that immortality which would otherwise have
been conferred upon him.  The goddess then made herself known, and
asked that the pillar which supported the roof might be given to her.
Having taken the pillar down, she cut it open easily, and having taken
out what she wanted, she wrapped up the remainder of the trunk in fine
linen, and having poured perfumed oil over it, she delivered it again
into the hands of the king and queen.  Now, this piece of wood is to
this day preserved in the temple, and worshipped by the people of
Byblos.  When this was done, Isis threw herself upon the chest, and
made at the same time such loud and terrible cries of lamentation over
it, that the younger of the king's sons who heard her was frightened
out of his life.  But the elder of them she took with her, and set sail
with the chest for Egypt.  Now, it being morning the river Phaedrus
sent forth a keen and chill air, and becoming angry she dried up its
current.


XVII.  At the first place where she stopped, and when she believed that
she was alone, she opened the chest, and laying her face upon that of
her dead husband, she embraced him and wept bitterly.  Then, seeing
that the little boy had silently stolen up behind her, and had found
out the reason of her grief, she turned upon him suddenly, and, in her
anger, gave him so fierce and terrible a look that he died of fright
immediately.  Others say that his death did not happen in this manner,
but, as already hinted, that he fell into the sea.  Afterwards he
received the greatest honour on account of the goddess, for this
Maneros, whom the Egyptians so frequently call upon at their banquets,
is none other than he.  This story is contradicted by those who tell us
that the true name of this child was Palaestinus, or Pelusius, and that
the city of this name was built by the goddess in memory of him.  And
they further add that this Maneros is thus honoured by the Egyptians at
their feasts because he was the first who invented music.  Others again
state that Maneros is not the name of any particular person, but a were
customary form of complimentary greeting which the Egyptians use
towards each other at their more solemn feasts and banquets, meaning no
more by it than to wish "that what they were then about might prove
fortunate and happy to them."  This is the true import of the word.  In
like manner they say that the human skeleton which is carried about in
a box on festal occasions, and shown to the guests, is not designed, as
some imagine, to represent the particular misfortunes of Osiris, but
rather to remind them of their mortality, and thereby to excite them
freely to make use of and to enjoy the good things which are set before
them, seeing that they must quickly become such as they there saw.
This is the true reason for introducing the skeleton at their banquets.
But to proceed with the narrative.


XVIII.   When Isis had come to her son Horus, who was being reared at
Buto,[FN#305] she deposited the chest in a remote and unfrequented
place.  One night, however, when Typhon was hunting by the light of the
moon, he came upon it by chance, and recognizing the body which was
enclosed in it, he tore it into several pieces, fourteen[FN#306] in
all, and scattered them in different places up and down the country.
When Isis knew what had been done, she set out in search of the
scattered portions of her husband's body; and in order to pass more
easily through the lower, marshy parts of the country, she made use of
a boat made of the papyrus plant.  For this reason, they say, either
fearing the anger of the goddess, or else venerating the papyrus, the
crocodile never injures anyone who travels in this sort of
vessel.[FN#307]  And this, they say, hath given rise to the report that
there are very many different sepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, for
wherever Isis found one of the scattered portions of her husband's
body, there she buried it.  Others, however, contradict this story, and
tell us that the variety of sepulchres of Osiris was due rather to the
policy of the queen, who, instead of the real body, as she pretended,
presented to these cities only an image of her husband.  This she did
in order to increase the honours which would by these means be paid to
his memory, and also to defeat Typhon, who, if he were victorious in
his fight against Horus in which he was about to engage, would search
for the body of Osiris, and being distracted by the number of
sepulchres would despair of ever being able to find the true one.  We
are told, moreover, that notwithstanding all her efforts, Isis was
never able to discover the phallus of Osiris, which, having been thrown
into the Nile immediately upon its separation from the rest of the
body,[FN#308] had been devoured by the Lepidotus, the Phagrus, and the
Oxyrhynchus, fish which above all others, for this reason, the
Egyptians have in more especial avoidance.  In order, however, to make
some amends for the loss, Isis consecrated the phallus made in
imitation of it, and instituted a solemn festival to its memory, which
is even to this day observed by the Egyptians.


[FN#305]  In Egyptian, the double city Pe-Tep.  See the texts from the
Metternich Stele printed in this volume.

[FN#306]  The fourteen members are: head, feet, bones, arms, heart,
interior, tongue, eyes, fists, fingers, back, ears, loins, and body.
Some of the lists in Egyptian add the face of a ram and the hair.  The
cities in which Isis buried the portions of his body are: Koptos,
Philae in Elephantine, Herakleopolis Magna, Kusae, Heliopolis,
Diospolis of Lower Egypt, Letopolis, Sais, Hermopolis of Lower Egypt,
Athribis, Aq (Schedia), Ab in the Libyan nome, Netert, Apis.

[FN#307]  Moses was laid in an ark of bulrushes, i.e., papyrus, and was
found uninjured.

[FN#308]  We meet with a similar statement in the Tale of the Two
Brothers, where we are told that the younger brother, having declared
his innocence to the elder brother, out off his phallus and threw it
into the river, where it was devoured by the naru fish.


XIX.  After these things Osiris returned from the other world, and
appeared to his son Horus, and encouraged him to fight, and at the same
time instructed him in the exercise of arms.  He then asked him what he
thought was the most glorious action a man could perform, to which
Horus replied, "To revenge the injuries offered to his father[FN#309]
and mother."  Osiris then asked him what animal he thought most
serviceable to a soldier, and Horus replied, "A horse."  On this Osiris
wondered, and he questioned him further, asking him why he preferred a
horse to a lion, and Horus replied, "Though the lion is the more
serviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is the
horse more useful in overtaking and cutting off a flying
enemy."[FN#310]  These replies caused Osiris to rejoice greatly, for
they showed him that his son was sufficiently prepared for his enemy.
We are, moreover, told that amongst the great numbers who were
continually deserting from Typhon's party was his concubine
Thoueris,[FN#311] and that a serpent which pursued her as she was
coming over to Horus was slain by his soldiers.  The memory of this
action is, they say, still preserved in that cord which is thrown into
the midst of their assemblies, and then chopped in pieces.  Afterwards
a battle took place between Horus and Typhon, which lasted many days,
but Horus was at length victorious, and Typhon was taken prisoner.  He
was delivered over into the custody of Isis, who, instead of putting
him to death, loosed his fetters and set him free.  This action of his
mother incensed Horus to such a degree that he seized her, and pulled
the royal crown off her head; but Hermes came forward, and set upon her
head the head of an ox instead of a helmet.[FN#312]  After this Typhon
accused Horus of illegitimacy, but, by the assistance of Hermes, his
legitimacy was fully established by a decree of the gods
themselves.[FN#313]  After this two other battles were fought between
Horus and Typhon, and in both Typhon was defeated.  Moreover, Isis is
said to have had union with Osiris after his death,[FN#314] and she
brought forth Harpokrates,[FN#315] who came into the world before his
time, and was lame in his lower limbs.


[FN#309]  The texts give as a very common title of Horus, "Horus, the
avenger of his father."

[FN#310]  There is no evidence that the Egyptians employed the horse in
war before the XVIIIth Dynasty, a fact which proves that the dialogue
here given is an invention of a much later date than the original
legend of Osiris.

[FN#311]  In Egyptian, TA-URT, the hippopotamus goddess.

[FN#312]  According to the legend given in the Fourth Sallier Papyrus,
the fight between Horus and Set began on the 26th day of the month of
Thoth, and lasted three days and three nights.  It was fought in or
near the hall of the lords of Kher-aha, i.e., near Heliopolis, and in
the presence of Isis, who seems to have tried to spare both her brother
Set and her son Horus.  For some reason Horus became enraged with his
mother, and attacking her like a "leopard of the south," he cut off the
head of Isis.  Thereupon Thoth came forward, and using words of power,
created a substitute in the form of a cow's head, and placed it on her
body (Sallier, iv., p. 2; see Select Papyri, pl. cxlv.).

[FN#313]  Horus inherited the throne by his father's will, a fact which
is so often emphasized in the texts that it seems there may be some
ground for Plutarch's view.

[FN#314]  This view is confirmed by the words in the hymn to Osiris,
"she moved the inactivity of the Still-Heart (Osiris), she drew from
him his essence, she made an heir."

[FN#315]  In Egyptian, HERU-PA-KHART, "Horus the Child."


XX.  Such then are the principal circumstances of this famous story,
the more harsh and shocking parts of it, such as the cutting up of
Horus and the beheading of Isis, being omitted.  Now, if such could be
supposed to be the real sentiments of the Egyptians concerning those
divine Beings whose most distinguishing characteristics are happiness
and immortality, or could it be imagined that they actually believed
what they thus tell us ever to have actually taken place, I should not
need to warn you, O Clea, you who are already sufficiently averse to
such impious and absurd notions of the God, I should not, I say, have
need to caution you, to testify your abhorrence of them, and, as
Aeschylus expresses it, "to spit and wash your mouth" after the recital
of them.  In the present case, however, it is not so.  And I doubt not
that you yourself are conscious of the difference between this history
and those light and idle fictions which the poets and other writers of
fables, like spiders, weave and spin out of their own imaginations,
without having any substantial ground or firm foundation to work upon.
There must have been some real distress, some actual calamity, at the
bottom as the ground-work of the narration; for, as mathematicians
assure us, the rainbow is nothing else but a variegated image of the
sun, thrown upon the sight by the reflection of his beams from the
clouds; and thus ought we to look upon the present story as the
representation, or rather reflection, of something real as its true
cause.  And this notion is still farther suggested to us as well by
that solemn air of grief and sadness which appears in their sacrifices,
as by the very form and arrangement of their temples, which extend into
long avenues and open aisles in some portions,[FN#316] and in others
retreating into dark and gloomy chapels which resembled the underground
vaults which are allotted to the dead.  That the history has a
substantial foundation is proved by the opinion which obtains generally
concerning the sepulchres of Osiris.  There are many places wherein his
body is said to have been deposited, and among these are Abydos and
Memphis, both of which are said to contain his body.  It is for this
reason, they say, that the richer and more prosperous citizens wish to
be buried in the former of these cities, being ambitious of lying, as
it were, in the grave with Osiris.[FN#317]  The title of Memphis to be
regarded as the grave of Osiris seems to rest upon the fact that the
Apis Bull, who is considered to be the image of the soul of Osiris, is
kept in that city for the express purpose that it may be as near his
body as possible.[FN#318]  Others again tell us that the interpretation
of the name Memphis[FN#319] is "the haven of good men," and that the
true sepulchre of Osiris lies in that little island which the Nile
makes at Philae.[FN#320]  This island is, they say, inaccessible, and
neither bird can alight on it, nor fish swim near it, except at the
times when the priests go over to it from the mainland to solemnize
their customary rites to the dead, and to crown his tomb with flowers,
which, they say, is overshadowed by the branches of a tamarisk-tree,
the size of which exceeds that of an olive-tree.


[FN#316]  Plutarch refers to the long colonnaded courts which extend in
a straight line to the sanctuary, which often contains more than one
shrine, and to the chambers wherein temple properties, vestments, &c.,
were kept.

[FN#317]  In what city the cult of Osiris originated is not known, but
it is quite certain that before the end of the VIth Dynasty Abydos
became the centre of his worship, and that he dispossessed the local
god An-Her in the affections of the people.  Tradition affirmed that
the head of Osiris was preserved at Abydos in a box, and a picture of
it, #### became the symbol of the city.  At Abydos a sort of miracle
play, in which all the sufferings and resurrection of Osiris were
commemorated, was performed annually, and the raising up of a model of
his body, and the placing of his head upon it, were the culminating
ceremonies.  At Abydos was the famous shaft into which offerings were
cast for transmission to the dead in the Other World, and through the
Gap in the hills close by souls were believed to set out on their
journey thither.  One tradition places the Elysian Fields in the
neighbourhood of Abydos.  A fine stone bier, a restoration probably of
the XXVIth Dynasty, which represented the original bier of Osiris, was
discovered there by M. Amelineau.  It is now in the Egyptian Museum at
Cairo.

[FN#318]  Apis is called the "life of Osiris," ####, and on the death
of the Bull, its soul went to heaven and joined itself to that of
Osiris, and it formed with him the dual-god Asar-Hep, i.e., Osiris-
Apis, or Sarapis.  The famous Serapeum at Memphis was called ####.

[FN#319]  In Egyptian, Men-Nefer, i.e., "fair haven."

[FN#320]  Osiris and Isis were worshipped at Philae until the reign of
Justinian, when his general, Narses, closed the temple and carried off
the statues of the gods to Constantinople, where they were probably
melted down.


XXI.  Eudoxus indeed asserts that, although there are many pretended
sepulchres of Osiris in Egypt, the, place where his body actually lies
is Busiris,[FN#321] where likewise he was born.[FN#322]  As to
Taphosiris, there is no need to mention it particularly, for its very
name indicates its claim to be the tomb of Osiris.  There are likewise
other circumstances in the Egyptian ritual which hint to us the reality
upon which this history is grounded, such as their cleaving the trunk
of a tree, their wrapping it up in linen which they tear in pieces for
that purpose, and the libations of oil which they afterwards pour upon
it; but these I do not insist on, because they are intermixed with such
of their mysteries as may not be revealed.


[FN#321] In Egyptian, Pa-Asar-neb-Tetu, "the house of Osiris, the lord
of Tetu."  In the temple of Neb-Sekert, the backbone of the god was
preserved, according to one text, but another says it was his jaws(?)
and interior.

[FN#322]  This view represents a late tradition, or at all events one
which sprang up after the decay of Abydos.


[FIRST EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]


XXII.  Now as to those who, from many things of this kind, some of
which are proclaimed openly, and others are darkly hinted at in their
religious institutions, would conclude that the whole story is no other
than a mere commemoration of the various actions of their kings and
other great men, who, by reason of their excellent virtue and the
mightiness of their power, added to their other titles the honour of
divinity, though they afterwards fell into many and grievous
calamities, those, I say, who would in this manner account for the
various scenes above-mentioned, must be owned indeed to make use of a
very plausible method of eluding such difficulties as may arise about
this subject, and ingeniously enough to transfer the most shocking
parts of it from the divine to the human nature.  Moreover, it must be
admitted that such a solution is not entirely destitute of any
appearance of historical evidence for its support.  For when the
Egyptians themselves tell us that Hermes had one hand shorter than
another, that Typhon was of red complexion, Horus fair, and Osiris
black, does not this show that they were of the human species, and
subject to the same accidents as all other men?[FN#323]  Nay, they go
farther, and even declare the particular work in which each was engaged
whilst alive.  Thus they say that Osiris was a general, that Canopus,
from whom the star took its name, was a pilot, and that the ship which
the Greeks call Argo, being made in imitation of the ship of Osiris,
was, in honour of him, turned into a constellation and placed near
Orion and the Dog-star, the former being sacred to Horus and the latter
to Isis.


[FN#323]  Red is the colour attributed to all fiends in the Egyptian
texts.  One of the forms of Horus is described as being "blue-eyed,"
and the colour of the face of Osiris is often green, and sometimes
black.


XXIII.  But I am much afraid that to give in to this explanation of the
story will be to move things which ought not to be moved; and not only,
as Simonides says, "to declare war against all antiquity," but likewise
against whole families and nations who are fully possessed with the
belief in the divinity of these beings.  And it would be no less than
dispossessing those great names of their heaven, and bringing them down
to the earth.  It would be to shake and loosen a worship and faith
which have been firmly settled in nearly all mankind from their
infancy.  It would be to open a wide door for atheism to enter in at,
and to encourage the attempts of those who would humanize the divine
nature.  More particularly it would give a clear sanction and authority
to the impostures of Euhemerus the Messenian, who from mere
imagination, and without the least appearance of truth to support it,
has invented a new mythology of his own, asserting that "all those in
general who are called and declared to be gods are none other than so
many ancient generals and sea-captains and kings."  Now, he says that
he found this statement written in the Panchaean dialect in letters of
gold, though in what part of the globe his Panchaeans dwell, any more
than the Tryphillians, whom he mentions at the same time with them, he
does not inform us.  Nor can I learn that any other person, whether
Greek or Barbarian, except himself, has ever yet been so fortunate as
to meet with these imaginary countries.


[In Sec. XXIV.  Plutarch goes on to say that the Assyrians commemorate
Semiramis, the Egyptians Sesostris, the Phrygians Manis or Masdis, the
Persians Cyrus, and the Macedonians Alexander, yet these heroes are not
regarded as gods by their peoples.  The kings who have accepted the
title of gods have afterwards had to suffer the reproach of vanity and
presumption, and impiety and injustice.]


[SECOND EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]


XXV.  There is another and a better method which some employ in
explaining this story.  They assert that what is related of Typhon,
Osiris, and Isis is not to be regarded as the afflictions of gods, or
of mere mortals, but rather as the adventures of certain great Daemons.
These beings, they say, are supposed by some of the wisest of the Greek
philosophers, that is to say, Plato, Pythagoras, Xenocrates, and
Chrysippus, in accordance with what they had learned from ancient
theologians, to be stronger and more powerful than men, and of a nature
superior to them.  They are, at the same time, inferior to the pure and
unmixed nature of the gods, as partaking of the sensations of the body,
as well as of the perceptions of the soul, and consequently liable to
pain as well as pleasure, and to such other appetites and affections,
as flow from their various combinations.  Such affections, however,
have a greater power and influence over some of them than over others,
just as there are different degrees of virtue and vice found in these
Daemons as well as in mankind.  In like manner, the wars of the Giants
and the Titans which are so much spoken of by the Greeks, the
detestable actions of Kronos, the combats between Apollo and the
Python, the flights of Dionysos, and the wanderings of Demeter, are
exactly of the same nature as the adventures of Osiris and Typhon.
Therefore, they all are to be accounted for in the same manner, and
every treatise of mythology will readily furnish us with an abundance
of other similar instances.  The same thing may also be affirmed of
those other things which are so carefully concealed under the cover of
mysteries and imitations.


[In Sec. XXVI.  Plutarch points out that Homer calls great and good men
"god-like" and "God's compeers," but the word Daemon is applied to the
good and bad indifferently (see Odyssey, vi. 12; Iliad, xiii. 810, v.
438, iv. 31, &c.).  Plato assigns to the Olympian Gods good things and
the odd numbers, and the opposite to the Daemons.  Xenocrates believed
in the existence of a series of strong and powerful beings which take
pleasure in scourgings and fastings, &c.  Hesiod speaks of "holy
daemons" (Works and Days, 126) and "guardians of mankind," and
"bestowers of wealth," and these are regarded by Plato as a "middle
order of beings between the gods and men, interpreters of the wills of
the gods to men, and ministering to their wants, carrying the prayers
and supplications of mortals to heaven, and bringing down thence in
return oracles and all other blessings of life."  Empedocles thought
that the Daemons underwent punishment, and that when chastened and
purified they were restored to their original state.]


[Sec. XXVII.  To this class belonged Typhon, who was punished by Isis.  In
memory of all she had done and suffered, she established certain rites
and mysteries which were to be types and images of her deeds, and
intended these to incite people to piety, and, to afford them
consolation.  Isis and Osiris were translated from good Daemons into
gods, and the honours due to them are rightly of a mixed kind, being
those due to gods and Daemons.  Osiris is none other than Pluto, and
Isis is not different from Proserpine.]


[Sec. XXX.  Typhon is held by the Egyptians in the greatest contempt, and
they do all they can to vilify him.  The colour red being associated
with him, they treat with contumely all those who have a ruddy
complexion; the ass[FN#324] being usually of a reddish colour, the men
of Koptos are in the habit of sacrificing asses by casting them down
precipices. The inhabitants of Busiris and Lycopolis never use
trumpets, because their sounds resemble the braying of an ass.  The
cakes which are offered at the festivals during Paoni and Paopi are
stamped with the figure of a fettered ass.  The Pythagoreans regarded
Typhon as a daemon, and according to them he was produced in the even
number fifty-six; and Eudoxus says that a figure of fifty-six angles
typifies the nature of Typhon.]


[FN#324]  The ass is associated with Set, or Typhon, in the texts, but
on account of his virility he also typifies a form of the Sun-god.  In
a hymn the deceased prays, "May I smite the Ass, may I crush the
serpent-fiend Sebau," but the XLth Chapter of the Book of the Dead is
entitled, "Chapter of driving back the Eater of the Ass."  The vignette
shows us the deceased in the act of spearing a monster serpent which
has fastened its jaws in the back of an ass.  In Chapter CXXV. there is
a dialogue between the Cat and the Ass.


[Sec. XXXI.  The Egyptians only sacrifice red-coloured bulls, and a single
black or white hair in the animal's head disqualifies it for sacrifice.
They sacrifice creatures wherein the souls of the wicked have been
confined, and through this view arose the custom of cursing the animal
to be sacrificed, and cutting off its bead and throwing it into the
Nile.  No bullock is sacrificed which has not on it the seal of the
priests who were called "Sealers."  The impression from this seal
represents a man upon his knees, with his hands tied behind him, and a
sword pointed at his throat.  The ass is identified with Typhon not
only because of his colour, but also because of his stupidity and the
sensuality of his disposition.  The Persian king Ochus was nicknamed
the "Ass," which made him to say, "This ass shall dine upon your ox,"
and accordingly he slew Apis.  Typhon is said to have escaped from
Horus by a flight of seven days on an ass.]


[THIRD EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]


XXXII.  Such then are the arguments of those who endeavour to account
for the above-mentioned history of Isis and Osiris upon a supposition
that they were of the order of Daemons; but there are others who
pretend to explain it upon other principles, and in more philosophical
manner.  To begin, then, with those whose reasoning is the most simple
and obvious.  As the Greeks allegorize their Kronos into Time, and
their Hera into Air, and tell us that the birth of Hephaistos is no
other but the change of air into fire, so these philosophers say that
by Osiris the Egyptians mean the Nile, by Isis that part of the country
which Osiris, or the Nile, overflows, and by Typhon the sea, which, by
receiving the Nile as it runs into it, does, as it were, tear it into
many pieces, and indeed entirely destroys it, excepting only so much of
it as is admitted into the bosom of the earth in its passage over it,
which is thereby rendered fertile.  The truth of this explanation is
confirmed, they say, by that sacred dirge which they make over Osiris
when they bewail "him who was born on the right side of the world and
who perished on the left."[FN#325]  For it must be observed that the
Egyptians look upon the east as the front or face of the world,[FN#326]
upon the north as its right side,[FN#327] and upon the south as its
left.[FN#328]  As, therefore, the Nile rises in the south, and running
directly northwards is at last swallowed up by the sea, it may rightly
enough be said to be born on the right and to perish on the left side.
This conclusion, they say, is still farther strengthened from that
abhorrence which the priests express towards the sea, as well as salt,
which they call "Typhon's foam."  And amongst their prohibitions is one
which forbids salt being laid on their tables.  And do they not also
carefully avoid speaking to pilots, because this class of men have much
to do with the sea and get their living by it?  And this is not the
least of their reasons for the great dislike which they have for fish,
and they even make the fish a symbol of "hatred," as is proved by the
pictures which are to be seen on the porch of the temple of Neith at
Sais.  The first of these is a child, the second is an old man, the
third is a hawk, and then follow a fish and a hippopotamus.  The
meaning of all these is evidently, "O you who are coming into the
world, and you who are going out of it (i.e., both young and old), God
hateth impudence."  For by the child is indicated "all those who are
coming into life"; by the old man, "those who are going out of it"; by
the hawk, "God"; by the fish, "hatred," on account of the sea, as has
been before stated; and by the hippopotamus, "impudence," this creature
being said first to slay his sire, and afterwards to force his
dam.[FN#329]  The Pythagoreans likewise may be thought perhaps by some
to have looked upon the sea as impure, and quite different from all the
rest of nature, and that thus much is intended by them when they call
it the "tears of Kronos."


[FN#325]  Plutarch here refers to Osiris as the Moon, which rises in
the West.

[FN#326]  According to the texts the front of the world was the south,
khent, #### and from this word is formed the verb #### #### "to sail to
the south."

[FN#327]  In the texts the west is the right side, unemi, #### in
Coptic, ####.

[FN#328]  In the texts the east is the left side, abti.

[FN#329]  Each of these signs, ####, except the last, does mean what
Plutarch says it means, but his method of reading them together is
wrong, and it proves that he did not understand that hieroglyphics were
used alphabetically as well as ideographically.


[Secs. XXXIII., XXXIV.  Some of the more philosophical priests assert that
Osiris does not symbolize the Nile only, nor Typhon the sea only, but
that Osiris represents the principle and power of moisture in general,
and that Typhon represents everything which is scorching, burning, and
fiery, and whatever destroys moisture.  Osiris they believe to have
been of a black[FN#330] colour, because water gives a black tinge to
everything with which it is mixed.  The Mnevis Bull[FN#331] kept at
Heliopolis is, like Osiris, black in colour, "and even Egypt[FN#332]
itself, by reason of the extreme blackness of the soil, is called by
them 'Chemia,' the very name which is given to the black part or pupil
of the eye.[FN#333]  It is, moreover, represented by them under the
figure of a human heart."  The Sun and Moon are not represented as
being drawn about in chariots, but as sailing round the world in ships,
which shows that they owe their motion, support, and nourishment to the
power of humidity.[FN#334]  Homer and Thales both learned from Egypt
that "water was the first principle of all things, and the cause of
generation."[FN#335]]


[FN#330]  Experiments recently conducted by Lord Rayleigh indicate that
the true colour of water is blue.

[FN#331]  In Egyptian, Nem-ur, or Men-ur, and he was "called the life
of Ra."

[FN#332]  The commonest name of Egypt is Kemt, "black land," as opposed
to the reddish-yellow sandy deserts on each side of the "valley of
black mud."  The word for "black" is kam.

[FN#333]  Plutarch seems to have erred here.  The early texts call the
pupil of the eye "the child in the eye," as did the Semitic peoples
(see my Liturgy of Funerary Offerings, p. 136).  The Copts spoke of the
"black of the eye," derived from the hieroglyphic "darkness,"
"blackness."

[FN#334]  There is no support for this view in the texts.

[FN#335]  It was a very common belief in Egypt that all things arose
from the great celestial ocean called Nu, whence came the Nile.


[Sec. XXXVI.  The Nile and all kinds of moisture are called the "efflux of
Osiris."  Therefore a water-pitcher[FN#336] is always carried first in
his processions, and the leaf of a fir-tree represents both Osiris and
Egypt.[FN#337]  Osiris is the great principle of fecundity, which is
proved by the Pamylia festivals, in which a statue of the god with a
triple phallus is carried about.[FN#338]  The three-fold phallus merely
signifies any great and indefinite number.]


[FN#336]  Plutarch refers to the vessel of water, with which the priest
sprinkles the ground to purify it.

[FN#337]  He seems to refer here to the olive-tree: Beqet, "olive
land," was one of the names of Egypt.

[FN#338]  Plutarch seems to be confounding Osiris with Menu, the god of
generation, who is generally represented in an ithyphallic form.  The
festival of the phallus survived in Egypt until quite recently.


[Sec. XXXVIII.  The Sun is consecrated to Osiris, and the lion is
worshipped, and temples are ornamented with figures of this animal,
because the Nile rises when the sun is in the constellation of the
Lion.  Horus, the offspring of Osiris, the Nile, and Isis, the Earth,
was born in the marshes of Buto, because the vapour of damp land
destroys drought.  Nephthys, or Teleute, represents the extreme limits
of the country and the sea-shore, that is, barren land.  Osiris (i.e.,
the Nile) overflowed this barren land, and Anubis[FN#339] was the
result.[FN#340]]


[FN#339]  The Egyptian Anpu.  The texts make one form of him to be the
son of Set and Nephthys.

[FN#340]  Plutarch's explanations in this chapter are unsupported by
the texts.


[Sec. XXXIX.  In the first part of this chapter Plutarch continues his
identification of Typhon with drought, and his ally Aso, Queen of
Ethiopia, he considers to be the Etesian or north winds, which blow for
a long period when the Nile is falling. He goes on to say:--]

As to what they relate of the shutting up of Osiris in a box, this
appears to mean the withdrawal of the Nile to its own bed.  This is the
more probable as this misfortune is said to have happened to Osiris in
the month of Hathor, precisely at that season of the year when, upon
the cessation of the Etesian or north winds the Nile returns to its own
bed, and leaves the country everywhere bare and naked.  At this time
also the length of the nights increases, darkness prevails, whilst
light is diminished and overcome.  At this time the priests celebrate
doleful rites, and they exhibit as a suitable representation of the
grief of Isis a gilded ox covered with a fine black linen cloth.  Now,
the ox is regarded as the living image of Osiris.  This ceremony is
performed on the seventeenth and three following days,[FN#341] and they
mourn: 1.  The falling of the Nile; 2.  The cessation of the north
winds; 3.  The decrease in the length of the days; 4.  The desolate
condition of the land.  On the nineteenth of the month Pachons they
march in procession to the sea, whither the priests and other officials
carry the sacred chest, wherein is enclosed a small boat of gold; into
this they first pour some water, and then all present cry out with a
loud voice, "Osiris is found."  This done, they throw some earth,
scent, and spices into the water, and mix it well together, and work it
up into the image of a crescent, which they afterwards dress in
clothes.  This shows that they regard the gods as the essence and power
of water and earth.


[FN#341]  The 17th day is very unlucky; the 18th is very lucky; the
19th and 20th are very unlucky.  On the 17th day Isis and Nephthys made
great lamentation for their brother Un-nefer at Sais; on the 19th no
man should leave the house; and the man born on the 20th would die of
the plague.


[Sec. XL.  Though Typhon was conquered by Horus, Isis would not allow him
to be destroyed. Typhon was once master of all Egypt, i.e., Egypt was
once covered by the sea, which is proved by the sea-shells which are
dug out of the mines, and are found on the tops of the hills.  The Nile
year by year creates new land, and thus drives away the sea further and
further, i.e., Osiris triumphs over Typhon.]


[FOURTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]


[Sec. XLI.  Osiris is the Moon, and Typhon is the Sun; Typhon is therefore
called Seth,[FN#342] a word meaning "violence," "force," &c.  Herakles
accompanies the Sun, and Hermes the Moon.  In Sec. XLII. Plutarch connects
the death-day of Osiris, the seventeenth of Hathor, with the
seventeenth day of the Moon's revolution, when she begins to wane.  The
age of Osiris, twenty-eight years, suggests the comparison with the
twenty-eight days of the Moon's revolution.  The tree-trunk which is
made into the shape of a crescent at the funeral of Osiris refers to
the crescent moon when she wanes.  The fourteen pieces into which
Osiris was broken refer to the fourteen days in which the moon wanes.]


[FN#342]  In Egyptian, ####, or #### which Plutarch seems to connect
with set, ####.


[Sec. XLIII.  The height of the Nile in flood at Elephantine is twenty-
eight cubits, at Mendes and Xois low Nile is seven cubits, and at
Memphis middle Nile is fourteen cubits; these figures are to be
compared with the twenty-eight days of the Moon's revolution, the
seven-day phase of the Moon, and the fourteen days' Moon, or full moon.
Apis was begotten by a ray of light from the Moon, and on the
fourteenth day of the month Phamenoth[FN#343] Osiris entered the Moon.
Osiris is the power of the Moon, Isis the productive faculty in it.]


[FN#343]  Marked in the papyrus Sallier IV. as a particularly unlucky
day.


[FIFTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.]


[Sec. XLIV.  The philosophers say that the story is nothing but an
enigmatical description of the phenomena of Eclipses.  In Sec. XLV.
Plutarch discusses the five explanations which he has described, and
begins to state his own views about them.  It must be concluded, he
says, that none of these explanations taken by itself contains the true
explanation of the foregoing history, though all of them together do.
Typhon means every phase of Nature which is hurtful and destructive,
not only drought, darkness, the sea, &c.  It is impossible that any one
cause, be it bad or even good, should be the common principle of all
things.  There must be two opposite and quite different and distinct
Principles.  In Sec. XLVI., Plutarch compares this view with the Magian
belief in Ormazd and Ahriman, the former springing from light (Sec.
XLVII.), and the latter from darkness.  Ormazd made six good gods, and
Ahriman six of a quite contrary nature.  Ormazd increased his own bulk
three times, and adorned the heaven with stars, making the Sun to be
the guard of the other stars.  He then created twenty-four other gods,
and placed them in an egg, and Ahriman also created twenty-four gods;
the latter bored a hole in the shell of the egg and effected an
entrance into it, and thus good and evil became mixed together.  In Sec.
XLVIII. Plutarch quotes Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Aristotle, and Plato in
support of his hypothesis of the Two Principles, and refers to Plato's
Third Principle.  Sec. XLIX.  Osiris represents the good qualities of the
universal Soul, and Typhon the bad; Bebo[FN#344] is a malignant being
like Typhon, with whom Manetho identifies him.  Sec. L.  The ass,
crocodile, and hippopotamus are all associated with Typhon; in the form
of a crocodile Typhon escaped from Horus.[FN#345]


[FN#344]  In Egyptian, Bebi, or Baba, or Babai, he was the first-born
