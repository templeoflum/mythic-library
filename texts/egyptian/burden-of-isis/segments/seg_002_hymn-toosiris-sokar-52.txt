THEBURDEN OFISIS
INTRODUCTION
OfalltheEgyptian religiousbeliefs that existed
from thePrehistoric period down intoRoman
times, theoldest andtheonemost held invenera-
tionwas that connected with theworshipof
Osiris, Isisand Horus. These three, though
primarily onlylocalgods,atanearly period
became prominentdeities ofallEgypt;and
thecult ofIsis,moreparticularly, remained a
favouritealways, rivalling even that ofOsiris
inlater times.
Duringthemany thousand yearsofEgyptian
history, notonly didmany changes occur in
theceremonies connected with these cults, but
alsothelegends andoriginoftheOsirian faith
received many additions andinterpolations ;
andthus theoldfaith lostmuch ofitspurity.
The simplest form inwhich it4spreservedto
usstates that Osiris wastheson ofSeband
Nut—i.e.Earth andHeaven;ofwhom were
9


10 INTRODUCTION
born also Isis,Nephthys and Set, orSutekh,
asheisalso called.
Osiris married hissister Isis, while Setchose
Nephthys.Itisprobably duetothisfeature of
thelegendthat thePharaohs often married
their sisters, andoccasionallyalsotheir daughters.
Osiris wasthefirstdivine ruler ofEgypt:whence
hecame isnottold;butwhen hecame tothat
country, hefound itsunk inbarbarism and
ignorance, withnolawbutthat ofstrength,
and poverty everywhere. Hewent through
thelandsettling quarrels, organizing govern-
ment, teaching polite manners and customs,
dictating lawsandcivilizingthepeople.
Set, hisbrother, became jealousoftherenown
ofOsiris, andhated himbecause ofthegood
hehaddone;andresolved uponhisdestruction.
Assisted bythe evilspirits,ordemons (the"enemies"or"foes"ofthechants), Setcon-
structed alargechest exactlythesizeandshape
ofthebodyofhisbrother Osiris;and ata
feast given bythe latter, heoffered topresent
the chest, which wasrichly adorned, tothe
onewhose bodyitbest fitted. Noonewas
successful until Osiris entered thechest, when
Setclosed it,andwith thehelpoftheevilspirits
bore itfrom thebanquethalland cast itinto
the Nile. ThereuponIsis fled tothe Delta,
taking with herHorus, herson,whom she left
tobecared forinButo, accordingtosome


THELEGEND OFOSIRIS 11
legends ;others sayhewas leftwith Tehuti,
orThoth, godoflearning.Isisthen took a
boatandsearched theNile forthebodyofher
husband, which sheultimately found inthe
Delta. Before itcould beinterred, however, it
was stolen bySet,whothen divided thebody
intofourteenportions, andscattered them over
thewhole ofEgypt. Againthebereaved Isis
commenced asearch forthepiecesofherhus-
band's body, andfound thirteen;thefourteenth
piece, thephallus,shewasunable tofind, it
having been eaten byfish.
Wherever afragmentofthebodyofOsiris
wasfound, atemple was there erected tohis
memory ;andasthehead (oraccordingtosome
authorities, theheart) wasfound atAbydos,
thatcitywas considered asespecially sacred,
andwasthecentre ofhisworship.
Horus, son ofOsiris and Isis,avengedhis
father's death byultimately slaying Set;while
Osiris, miraculouslyresurrected byHorus in
theregionsofthedead, ruled over theunder-
world and itsinhabitants. Such, briefly,isthe
legendofOsiris. Butthecultcould never have
become national incharacter without changing
inmany ways. Every cityandtown ofany
prominenceinEgypt had itsownespeciallocal
deity, who receivedspecial worship, even while
other deities were admitted toexist, though
considered subordinate tohim :and atan


12 INTRODUCTION
earlydate thepriesthoodofOsiris began sys-
tematicallytoidentify theleadingcharacteristics
ofthese various local gods with those ofOsiris.
Hence incourse oftimewefind Osiris-Sokar,
anidentification ofthelocalgodSokar with the
great deityofAbydos ;Osiris-Apis, which in
Greek times becameSerapis, where theattributes
ofOsiris hadbecome identified with those ofa
Memphite deity;and inlater times, Osiris
became asolardeity, and isaddressed byepithets
and titles which seem toshow anidentification
withRa,thesungod.Bythismeans, Abydos
became thegreat early religiouscentre ofEgypt.
Butthese identifications ofvarious deities were
notconfined toOsiris. Horus became mutated,
andgained new attributes—asHorus-Ra, he
became themidday sun;andunder thepriest-
hood ofHeliopolis, hebecame Turn, thesetting
sun,evenlosinghisname. Isis, also, received
newqualifications, beingoften identified with
Hathor (whom theGreeks inturn identified with
Aphrodite) ;butthechiefplaces where Hathor
wasworshipped were atDendereh andatDer-
el-Bahri, inthewestern portionofThebes;
while theworshipofIsiscentred around Abydos
andBusiris, thelatter being frequently mentioned
intheliturgies;andinlater times alsoshewas
worshippedatPhilae;andherworship wasso
popular, thatlongafterEgypt hadceased tobe
anation, andhergodshadbecome aby-word,


EGYPTIAN TRINITIES 13
there werenolessthan threegreat temples erected
tohercultwithin thewalls ofRome itself.
Itisthismergingoftheattributes ofone
godinto those ofanother, and their unification
into Osiris, towhich thechants referwhen
speakingofthe"attributes"ofthe deities.
The eatingofthefourteenth fragmentofthe
bodyofOsiris byfish isparalleled byasimilar
legendinthestoryof"Anpu andBata," often
called the"Tale oftheTwo Brothers."
The triadwasnotanunusual combination in
theEgyptianbelief;forbesides that ofOsiris,
IsisandHorus, wefindAmen, MutandKhonsu
atThebes;and other lesser triads;sothat
whenChristianity reached Egypt,thetrinitarian
idea found ready adherents;and thismay
partly account forthestrides whichChristianity
made inEgypt almost before ithadobtained a
foothold elsewhere. The resurrection ofOsiris
and hisruling over thespiritsofthedeceased
isnearly aparallel tothestoryoftheCretan
King Minos, andpossesses somepointsincommon
with theChristian belief;while theworship
ofIsispaved thewayfortheworshipofthe
Virgin Marymany centuries later, thoughthis
latter wasrepudiated bytheEgyptianChristians
ofthe firstfour centuries, probably asbeing too
reminiscent of"
paganism." (Budge,"Paradise
oftheFathers," L,II.)
Theposition ofSet iscurious. While hewas


14 INTRODUCTION
considered anevildeity, yethehadmany temples
and worshippers;inearly times, strangely
enough,inaddition tothe"Horus"name, some
Pharaohs hada"Set"name;andthename of
Setwasusedbyseveral later Pharaohs, such as
Sety I.,SetyMerenptah, Set-aa-pehti, Set-Nekht
andothers.
Nephthys plays asomewhat unimportantrole
intheliturgies,aswell asintheEgyptian pan-
theon, being usuallyassociated with Isis. She
seems tohave repudiated Setafter themurder
ofOsiris, andtohave aided Isisinseekingfor
thebody.
Thecontinuityofthechants ismuch broken;
itappearsasiftwo, oreven three, deities are
addressed atthesamemoment. This, however,
isduetotwocauses :first, theidentification of
attributesoriginally belongingtodivers deities
inthepersonoftheonegodOsiris;andsecond,
tothefactthat these chants wereaccompanied
byspectacular performances —aforerunner ofthe"
miracle-plays"oftheElizabethanperiod.
Various templeofficials impersonated thegods
oncertain occasions, and these wereimplored,
invoked orpraisedastheliving representative
ofthedeity. Butmore frequently theanimal
sacred tothegodwasbrought outandworshipped—not forhimself, but forthedeity herepre-
sented. TheHawk ofHorus atEdfu, the
Crocodile ofSebek atCrocodilopolis,theCow


CHANTS OFIMMORTALITY 15
ofHathor, theBullApis—allwerepraisedasthe
living counterpart chosen bythegodtorepresent
himself. AndjustasinRoman Catholic churches,
atcertain times, abellwasformerly rungto
frighten awaytheDevil, sointheEgyptian
time thesistrum-bearer wasprominentatsacred
festivals;for itwas hisduty, byshakingthe
sistrum, nottofrightentheevilone,buttocall
theattention ofthedeity speciallytohiswor-
shippers.Thisaccounts forthefrequent appeal
intheliturgies—"Behold theexcellent sistrum-
bearer !"
What willmost impress oneintheseliturgies,
however, isthedeep,sincerereligious feelingthat
permeates them—thegriefforthelostone, the
hopeofagain beholding him, thecryfrom the
heart forhelp, the reliance upon thedivine
all-ruling destinythat shall bring the trial toa
happy ending, and thetriumphofadesire
realized andahopefulfilled :these sentiments,
asmuch apartofhuman nature now asthen,
bring the far-off dwellers oftheland ofKem
near atheartandfeelingtothetwentieth-century
reader ofourown era. Forabove allnations of
old,thefuture lifeentered especially into the
Egyptian dailylifeandthought ;theirreligion
wasonewhere thepresent wasconsidered only
thethreshold;and itwas their, belief inthe
absolute endlessness ofmatter and theim-
mortalityofthespirit that causes thefrequent

formula aftermanyoftheir names—"Ankh
zetta heh"—livingforever, eternal.
Thetwopapyriinwhich these chants are
found were both discovered inLuxor, Egypt ;
andthatrelating particularly toOsiris iswritten
inahandrepresenting anintermediatestage
between hieratic anddemotic. Thechants of
Isiswere found inside astatue ofOsiris, by
M.Passalaqua.
The period when these chants were first
written isunknown. Probablyinthe earliest
times, they were committed tomemory, and
handed down verbally from generation togenera-
tion, aswere somany traditions ofolden time.
Wemay believe, however, that they had
already been reduced towriting bythetime of
thefourth dynasty, thoughatthat time they
probablyconsistedchieflyoftheinvocatory
portions,thesubsidiary matterbeing added
later, andatdifferentperiods.
Thedate ofthetexts fromwhich thepresent
translations aremade approximates300 B.C.,
while the texts themselves arewritten ina
purer andmore classicstyle than aremost of
thewritingsofthattime;sothat itisprobable
that intheirpresent form they certainlyare
not later than thetwenty-sixth dynasty, and
mayprobably beasearlyastheeighteenthor
nineteenth.
The Osiris chant, together with one ofthe


EXISTING TEXTS 17
IsisandNephthys liturgies,exists inthehieratic
form inwhat isknown asthe"Rhind papyrus,"
B.M. 10188, while theother Isisliturgyisinthe
Berlin papyrus1425. Extracts have beenpub-
lished byPleyte,in"Recueil desTravaux,"
Vol. III.,andbyDr.E.A.Wallis Budgein
Vol. LII. of"
Archaeologia," many years ago.
DeHorrack publishedthesecond Isisliturgyin
French, atranslation ofwhich into English
appearedin"Records ofthePast," Vol. II.
Thethree chants, however, have notheretofore
been publishedinonevolume.
From thefrequent mention ofthe sistrum-
bearer inthechants, weknow that thismusical
instrument waschiefly employed, butthemusic
inwhich they were written isunknown. The
Egyptians rated musichighly, and Plato con-
sidered their musicsuperior totheGreek, both
formelody andenergy. Butharmony and
rhythm were always subordinated tothewords,
andthesubject-matter wasparamount. There
weretwo sorts ofharmonies known totheold
Egyptians, which theGreeks designatedas
"Dorian"and"Phrygian"—theformergrave,
slowandtranquil, thelatter adithyrambic form,
probably employedinthese chants, which was
forceful, appealing andenergetic.
TheEgyptians based their music onseven
diatonics, which Demetrius ofPhalerus attributes
to"theseven vowels"

senses, orthesevenplanets. Dion Cassius
corroborates him, while DionysosofHalicar-
nassussays,"Melody embraced aninterval of
five—itnever rosemore than three andone-half
tones towardhigh, and fell lesstoward bass."
Thisprobably wasaresult oftheuseofthethree-
stringed lyre.
Tofindaprobable originforthelegendof
Osiris and Isis, itmayseem strangetohave to
turn totheshores ofMexico andCentral America;
yetthere, among theruined cities oftheancient
Mayan civilization, accordingtoLePlongeon,
aretwotemples bearinghistorical inscriptions
which inmanydetails correspondwith the
Egyptian legend. Theking, rulingwelland

where shelived until herdeath. Herson ulti-

events tookplaceisabout tenthousand years
before Christ, ifthelegendsarose from onecom-
mon source itwould giveample time forhistory
tobecome mergedintomyth.


OSIRIS ALIVING RULER 19
Whatever betheoriginofthe Osiris belief,
however, itiscertain that inthebeginning he
didnottypify anyoftheforces ofnature, as
somewould have usbelieve :this isatheory of
much later datethan the belief upon which it
isgrafted, andbelongstoaperiodofdecline;and
Osiris israther toberegardedasoneofthegreat
rulers ofoldtime, far-seeing, advanced inhis
ideas, who fellamartyrtohisduty,hiscon-
science and hispeople. Had thePharaohs tried
rather toemulate theliving Osiris, instead of
simply being mergedintohim after death, Egypt
might have survived formany centuries the
cataclysms whicheventually overwhelmed her,
andputanendtoherexistence asanation.
