Text [Zipped]
This collection of Slavic folktales at first glance appears to
 have all of the usual suspects of European Märchen.
 Evil stepmothers: check; plucky youths overcome impossible odds to marry
 kings' daughter: check; dimwitted peasants given magical gifts: check.
What makes this book special are some tales and motifs that hint
 at even older lore.
 Number
27
is for all intents
 and purposes identical to the Native American 'Earth Diver' creation myth.
 In
47
, man is created from a drop
 of God's sweat.
 There are two tales of a global flood in
48
and
49
.
 In
36
there is a very dark 'Abraham and Isaac' story
 which goes a bit further than the Bible.
 In
51
, there is a story of a hundred-leaved
 rose bush which resembles images from the Kabbalah and Yogic lore.
 And number
59
is the tale of St. Patrick in a
 Balkan setting.
 All in all, a great anthology of eastern European folklore.
