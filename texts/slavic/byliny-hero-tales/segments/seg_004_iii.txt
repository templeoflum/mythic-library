III.
SVYATOGOR.
HERE was once a great Russian Hero who was
so big and strong that no one could stand up
against him, and he fancied that with his great
strength he could do anything.
One day he made up his mind to go out for a ride
on the plain, the great open plain in Russia, where one
can ride for miles without seeing anything but the
long waving feather grass.
He saddled and bridled his good horse, got upon his
back and rode out on the open plain. In his heart he
was glad; yes, he was glad—yes, and overflowing with
strength, and he said to himself:
“So strong do I feel that if I could find something
to take hold of I could lft up the whole world!”
He rode on a long way and presently saw another
man on horseback ahead of him. The man did not look
round, but he let fall a small wallet such as a man
often carries across his shoulder or across his horse.
Svyatogor saw it lying on the road and tried to push
it away with the end of his whip; it did not move.
He bent over and touched the wallet with his fingers,
but he could not move it. He stooped down from his

horse and grasped the wallet with his hand, but he
could not lift it.
“Many years have I journeyed upon this earth,”
said he, “but never have I come upon so strange a
thing. Such a wonder have I never seen. A little
wallet, a bag, that will not be pushed away, that cannot
be moved out of the way, and that cannot be lifted
up!”
The hero got off his good horse, stooped and
grasped the bag with both hands; he lifted it a little
higher than his knees, but he sank down into the
earth as far as his knees, and, not tears, but blood,
ran down his white face, and as he sank down he
could not rise again.
The man who was riding in front turned round
and rode back to him.
Svyatogoér asked:
“What was in that wallet to make it so heavy?”
The man answered:
“The weight of the whole world.”
“Who art thou?” asked Svyatogor.
“T am Mikula, the villager’s son.”
