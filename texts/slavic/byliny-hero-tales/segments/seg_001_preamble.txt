PREFACE.
This is a Byliny Book. What does “ Byliny’”’ mean ?
It is a Russian word, and it means stories about
What-has-Been, what happened in Russia in the old
days long ago. We all read about the Greek heroes
Jason and Perseus and Theseus and Heracles. The
Russians had splendid heroes too, who met with
wonderful adventures. Russia and France and Italy
and England are fighting side by side a great fight
for freedom, and these old heroes of Russia fought for
freedom too, against great barbarian armies of Huns
and Tartars. The Russians are our brave friends, our
“ Allies,” as we call them now, and it is good to get
to know about their heroes of olden times.
We all know and honour our French Allies, and
most of us try to speak French. We are proud to
read in history how our William the Conqueror came
over from France and brought with him many good
laws and customs, and, best of all, beautiful French
words that have now become English—why, the very
word beauty came to us from France. But Russia is
much further away than France, and very few of us
learn to speak Russian, or even to read it.

PREFACE.
Far the best way to get to know people is to
learn their language, but it is not quite so easy to
learn to read Russian as it is to read French, because
the Russians use different letters. You will see
Russian letters in the pictures'; they are beautiful,
delightful things, and some of them are like English,
so it is exciting to try and make them out, but some
of them are like Greek, for the Russians always liked
the Greeks better than the Romans.
The Russian names of the heroes look a little
strange at first, but they are not really hard to pro-
nounce. There are a great many Russian heroes, but
this book only tells about four of them, Volga and
Mikula and Svyatogér and Ilyé. Volga is quite short
and easy, and so is Mikula, which is pronounced as if
it was written Mikéolla. Svyatogér looks rather hard,
but you only have to remember to say it like
this—Svyatagorr, and you must roll the r’s as if you
were a Scotsman. The Russians put the accent on
the end of their words much oftener than the English.
We say ie van and they say Hevdhn. And 80 it is with
the last hero, Ilya’; he is pronounced Eelyah. Besides
the heroes there is Vladimir the king, and he is called
Vladéemir. The only really hard word to say right is
Byliny itself, and that you can call Bwiléeny, but our
English lips do not make quite the Russian sound.
These heroes Volga and Ilya and the rest lived very

PREFACE.
long ago, and their great city was not Petrograd but
Kiev (Kieft). Petrograd means “ Peter's fortified town,”’
and we all know how till the war it used to be called
Peters-burg. But if you look on the map you will
find no Petrograd, only Kiev on the river Dnieper,
which winds down to the Black Sea. The old Russian
heroes used to sail down the river on through the
Black Sea down to Constantinople, and there of course
they met the Greeks, and the Greeks taught them to
be Christians. That was in the days of good King
Vladimir, and he was reigning before our William the
Conqueror, hundreds of years before Peter the Great
came to Holland and England and learnt to build
boats, and made the great city of Petrograd.
But though the heroes lived so long ago, they are
never forgotten. The Russian children in the village
schools learn about Volgé and Ilya as soon as they
can read, and old minstrels in far away villages beyond
lake Onéga and even in Siberia sing the Byliny, the
songs of What-has-Been to the peasants as they sit
round the fire at night. I have seen a picture of one
of these singers, an old peasant over seventy, with a
long white beard and shaggy hair and bright deep-set
eyes. He could not write or read, and his voice was
rather cracked, but when he sang the old songs he was
all on fire, and he sang them so splendidly that
the villagers crowded round to hear. The old men
say that the young ones will not learn to
sing the songs because they are gramotnye, “ grammar-
people,” who read books and learn to write—what a pity.

PREFACE.
A learned Russian called Hilferding went to North
Russia to live among the peasants and listen to these
stories. The peasants are very poor, and are shy with
strangers, but they learned to love and trust Hilferding,
and sang their songs to him. It is nice to know that
he was able to help the peasants, and get them a little
more money and food. Other learned men had been
before Hilferding, but nearly all the stories in this
book were collected by him, so we like to remember
his name.
It is the peasants who sing the Byliny, not the
nobles, and two of the greatest Russian heroes, Ilya
and Mikula, are peasants’ sons. Mikula is a ploughman.
It sounds strange to us that a ploughman should be a
hero; but the Russians did not feel like that. They
love their land with all their hearts. Some of it has
very black fertile soil, but some of it is very hard and
full of stones, and sometimes of forests to be cleared, and
the man who does all this is a hero. The Russians
sing a hymn to the honour of Mikula; it ends “Glory
to thee, good Mikula, the peasant who worked.” In
one of the pictures you see Volga, the prince, come to
beg Mikula to leave his plough and join his warriors.
Mikula was sad, but a man must leave even his work
to defend his country. Mikula is my favourite of all
the heroes.
The peasant heroes, Mikula and great Ilya4, are
very proud and independent, and sometimes not very
respectful to the King; they seem to think they are
as good as he is, and so they were. It is their country
x


PREFACE.
they love, and their beautiful city of Kiev and its
Church, and in those old days they had not learned
that the King stands for the country. Ilyd is always
wanting to get to Kiev; you see him on the cover of this
book, riding up to the Holy City. It is like Jerusalem
to him, and he was buried there. But though he
dreams of the City, he loves the place where he was born,
near Mirom. Murom is a real place still, with forests
round it and a river full of fish. The peasants in the
old days owned the land in common, so each village
was like a little kingdom. Tlyé hates the dog, King
Kalin, because he slays the villagers.
Svyatogér’s name means Holy Mountain. He is
very strong and huge, like a mountain, but he is
clumsy and rather boastful. He boasted he could lift
anything, but he soon found he couldn’t. At the end
he stops boasting, and is good to young Ilya, and gives
him all his strength, so that makes up.
The hero who really can do everything is Volga.
He was a prince, not a peasant, and he was a mighty
hunter, like Nimrod in the Bible; and he was a wizard,
too, and could turn himself into a grey wolf. Some
people said his father was a wolf, some said he
was a serpent. The story says “damp earth was
his cradle,’ and that sounds uncomfortable, but the
Russians always call the earth “damp earth.” They
mean that the rain has rained on it, and that it is not
hard and dry, but full of sap like the trees. Volga
learnt all his wisdom from the beasts and_ birds.

the beasts and birds preach to him, and that is better,
for the Bible says:
Ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee;
And the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee.
