The first story is about Volgd, and in the first
picture you see him listening to a wise old Bear.
JANE ELLEN HARRISON.
This book is for children, and is no place for bibliography, but we
should like to own our debt to three books. Chudinov’s Byliny in the
“Russian School Library’’ was our first introduction (in Russian) to
the hero-tales; but for Rambaud’s La Russie Epique it would have
been difficult to put the stories together; and, last, to the kindness
of Mr. E. T. Minns we are indebted for the loan of Hilferding’s
invaluable Sbornik, now out of print, and not easily obtainable during
the War.
