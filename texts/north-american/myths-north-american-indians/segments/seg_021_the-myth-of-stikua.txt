The Myth of Stik[)u]a

[Transcriber's note: the "[)u]" sequence represents the Unicode u-breve
character.]

As an example of a myth as taken from the lips of the Indian by the
collector we append to this series of Chinook tales the story of
Stik[)u]a in all its pristine ingenuousness.  Such a tale well
exemplifies the difference of outlook between the aboriginal and the
civilized mind, and exhibits the many difficulties with which
collectors of such myths have to contend.

Many people were living at Nakotat.  Now their chief died.  He had
[left] a son who was almost grown up.  It was winter and the people
were hungry.  They had only mussels and roots to eat.  Once upon a time
a hunter said: "Make yourselves ready."  All the men made themselves
ready, and went seaward in two canoes.  {342} Then the hunter speared a
sea-lion.  It jumped and drifted on the water [dead].  They hauled it
ashore.  Blue Jay said: "Let us boil it here."  They made a fire and
singed it.  They cut it and boiled it.  Blue Jay said: "Let us eat it
here, let us eat all of it."  Then the people ate.  Raven tried to hide
a piece of meat in his mat, and carried it to the canoe.  [But] Blue
Jay had already seen it; he ran [after him] took it and threw it into
the fire.  He burned it.  Then they went home.  They gathered large and
small mussels.  In the evening they came home.  Then Blue Jay shouted:
"Stik[)u]a, fetch your mussels."  Stik[)u]a was the name of Blue Jay's
wife.  Then noise of many feet [was heard], and Stik[)u]a and the other
women came running down to the beach.  They went to fetch mussels.  The
women came to the beach and carried the mussels to the house.  Raven
took care of the chief's son.  The boy said: "To-morrow I shall
accompany you."  Blue Jay said to him: "What do you want to do?  The
waves will carry you away, you will drift away; even I almost drifted
away."

The next morning they made themselves ready.  They went into the canoe,
and the boy came down to the beach.  He wanted to accompany them, and
held on to the canoe.  "Go to the house, go to the house," said Blue
Jay.  The boy went up, but he was very sad.  Then Blue Jay said: "Let
us leave him."  The people began to paddle.  Then they arrived at the
sea-lion island.  The hunter went ashore and speared a sea-lion.  It
jumped and drifted on the water [dead].  They hauled it ashore and
pulled it up from the water.  Blue Jay said: "Let us eat it here; let
us eat all of it, else our chief's son would always want to come here."
They singed it, carved it, and boiled it there.  When it was done they
ate it all.  Raven {343} tried to hide a piece in his hair, but Blue
Jay took it out immediately and burned it.  In the evening they
gathered large and small mussels, and then they went home.  When they
approached the beach Blue Jay shouted: "Stik[)u]a, fetch your mussels!"
Then noise of many feet [was heard].  Stik[)u]a and her children and
all the other women came running down to the beach and carried the
mussels up to the house.  Blue Jay had told all those people: "Don't
tell our chief's son, else he will want to accompany us."  In the
evening the boy said: "To-morrow I shall accompany you."  But Blue Jay
said: "What do you want to do?  The waves will carry you away."  But
the boy replied: "I must go."

In the morning they made themselves ready for the third time.  The boy
went down to the beach and took hold of the canoe.  But Blue Jay pushed
him aside and said: "What do you want here?  Go to the house."  The boy
cried and went up to the house.  [When he turned back] Blue Jay said:
"Now paddle away.  We will leave him."  The people began to paddle, and
soon they reached the sea-lion island.  The hunter went ashore and
speared one large sea-lion.  It jumped and drifted on the water [dead].
They hauled it toward the shore, landed, pulled it up and singed it.
They finished singeing it.  Then they carved it and boiled it, and when
it was done they began to eat.  Blue Jay said: "Let us eat it all.
Nobody must speak about it, else our chief's son will always want to
accompany us."  A little [meat] was still left when they had eaten
enough.  Raven tried to take a piece with him.  He tied it to his leg
and said his leg was broken.  Blue Jay burned all that was left over.
Then he said to Raven: "Let me see your leg."  He jumped at it, untied
it, and found the piece {344} of meat at Raven's leg.  He took it and
burned it.  In the evening they gathered large and small mussels.  Then
they went home.  When they were near home Blue Jay shouted: "Stik[)u]a,
fetch your mussels!"  Then noise of many feet [was heard], and
Stik[)u]a [her children and the other women] came down to the beach and
carried the mussels up to the house.  The [women and children] and the
chief's son ate the mussels all night.  Then that boy said: "To-morrow
I shall accompany you."  Blue Jay said: "What do you want to do?  You
will drift away.  If I had not taken hold of the canoe I should have
drifted away twice."

On the next morning they made themselves ready for the fourth time.
The boy rose and made himself ready also.  The people hauled their
canoes into the water and went aboard.  The boy tried to board a canoe
also, but Blue Jay took hold of him and threw him into the water.  He
stood in the water up to his waist.  He held the canoe, but Blue Jay
struck his hands.  There he stood.  He cried, and cried, and went up to
the house.  The people went; they paddled, and soon they reached the
sea-lion island.  The hunter went ashore and speared a sea-lion.  It
jumped and drifted on the water [dead].  Again they towed it to the
island, and pulled it ashore.  They singed it.  When they had finished
singeing it they carved it and boiled it.  When it was done Blue Jay
said: "Let us eat it here."  They ate half of it and were satiated.
They slept because they had eaten too much.  Blue Jay awoke first, and
burned all that was left.  In the evening they gathered large and small
mussels and went home.  When they were near the shore he shouted:
"Stik[)u]a, fetch your mussels!"  Noise of many feet [was heard] and
Stik[)u]a [her children and the other women] came running down to the
beach {345} and carried up the mussels.  The boy said: "To-morrow I
shall accompany you."  But Blue Jay said: "What do you want to do?  We
might capsize and you would be drowned."

Early on the following morning the people made themselves ready.  The
boy arose and made himself ready also.  Blue Jay and the people hauled
their canoes down to the water.  The boy tried to board, but Blue Jay
threw him into the water.  He tried to hold the canoe.  The water
reached up to his armpits.  Blue Jay struck his hands [until he let
go].  Then the boy cried and cried.  Blue Jay and the other people went
away.

After some time the boy went up from the beach.  He took his arrows and
walked round a point of land.  There he met a young eagle and shot it.
He skinned it and tried to put the skin on.  It was too small; it
reached scarcely to his knees.  Then he took it off, and went on.
After a while he met another eagle.  He shot it and it fell down.  It
was a white-headed eagle.  He skinned it and tried the skin on, but it
was too small; it reached a little below his knees.  He took it off,
left it, and went on.  Soon he met a bald-headed eagle.  He shot it
twice and it fell down.  He skinned it and put the skin on.  It was
nearly large enough for him, and he tried to fly.  He could fly
downward only.  He did not rise.  He turned back, and now he could fly.
Now he went round the point seaward from Nakotat.  When he had nearly
gone round he smelled smoke of burning fat.  When he came round the
point he saw the people of his town.  He alighted on top of a tree and
looked down.  [He saw that] they had boiled a sea-lion and that they
ate it.  When they had nearly finished eating he flew up.  He thought:
"Oh, I wish Blue Jay would see me."  Then Blue Jay {346} looked up [and
saw] the bird flying about.  "Ah, a bird came to get food from us."
Five times the eagle circled over the fire; then it descended.  Blue
Jay took a piece of blubber and said: "I will give you this to eat."
The bird came down, grasped the piece of meat, and flew away.  "Ha!"
said Blue Jay, "that bird has feet like a man."  When the people had
eaten enough they slept.  Raven again hid a piece of meat.  Toward
evening they awoke and ate again; then Blue Jay burned the rest of
their food.  In the evening they gathered large and small mussels and
went home.  When the boy came home he lay down at once.  They
approached the village, and Blue Jay shouted: "Fetch your mussels,
Stik[)u]a!"  Noise of many feet [was heard] and Stik[)u]a [and the
other women] ran down to the beach and carried up the mussels.  They
tried to rouse the boy, but he did not arise.

The next morning the people made themselves ready and launched their
canoe.  The chief's son stayed in bed and did not attempt to accompany
them.  After sunrise he rose and called the women and children and
said: "Wash yourselves; be quick."  The women obeyed and washed
themselves.  He continued: "Comb your hair."  Then he put down a plank,
took a piece of meat out [from under his blanket, showed it to the
women, and said]: "Every day your husbands eat this."  He put two
pieces side by side on the plank, cut them to pieces, and greased the
heads of all the women and children.  Then he pulled the planks forming
the walls of the houses out of the ground.  He sharpened them [at one
end, and] those which were very wide he split in two.  He sharpened all
of them.  The last house of the village was that of the Raven.  He did
not pull out its wall-planks.  He put the planks on to the backs of the
women and children {347} and said: "Go down to the beach.  When you go
seaward swim five times round that rock.  Then go seaward.  When you
see sea-lions you shall kill them.  But you shall not give anything to
stingy people.  I shall take these children down.  They shall live on
the sea and be my relatives."

Then he split sinews.  The women went into the water and began to jump
[out of the water].  They swam five times back and forth in front of
the village.  Then they went seaward to the place where Blue Jay and
the men were boiling.  Blue Jay said to the men: "What is that?"  The
men looked and saw the girls jumping.  Five times they swam round Blue
Jay's rock.  Then they went seaward.  After a while birds came flying
to the island.  Their bills were [as red] as blood.  They followed [the
fish].  "Ah!" said Blue Jay, "do you notice them?  Whence come these
numerous birds?"  The Raven said: "Ha, squint-eye, they are your
children; do you not recognize them?"  Five times they went round the
rock.  Now [the boy] threw the sinews down upon the stones and said:
"When Blue Jay comes to gather mussels they shall be fast [to the
rocks]."  And he said to the women, turning toward the sea:
"Whale-Killer will be your name.  When you catch a whale you will eat
it, but when you catch a sea-lion you will throw it away; but you shall
not give anything to stingy people."

Blue Jay and the people were eating.  Then that hunter said: "Let us go
home.  I am afraid we have seen evil spirits; we have never seen
anything like that on this rock."  Now they gathered mussels and
carried along the meat which they had left over.  In the evening they
came near their home.  [Blue Jay shouted:] "Stik[)u]a, fetch your
mussels!"  There was no sound {348} of people.  Five times he called.
Now the people went ashore and [they saw that] the walls of the houses
had disappeared.  The people cried.  Blue Jay cried also, but somebody
said to him: "Be quiet.  Blue Jay; if you had not been bad our chief's
son would not have done so."  Now they all made one house.  Only Raven
had one house [by himself].  He went and searched for food on the
beach.  He found a sturgeon.  He went again to the beach and found a
porpoise.  Then Blue Jay went to the beach and tried to search for
food.  [As soon as he went out] it began to hail; the hailstones were
so large [indicating].  He tried to gather mussels and wanted to break
them off, but they did not come off.  He could not break them off.  He
gave it up.  Raven went to search on the beach and found a seal.  The
others ate roots only.  Thus their chief took revenge on them.


Beliefs of the Californian Tribes

The tribes of California afford a strange example of racial
conglomeration, speaking as they do a variety of languages totally
distinct from one another, and exhibiting many differences in physical
appearance and custom.  Concerning their mythological beliefs Bancroft
says:

"The Californian tribes, taken as a whole, are pretty uniform in the
main features of their theogonic beliefs.  They seem, without
exception, to have had a hazy conception of a lofty, almost supreme
being; for the most part referred to as a Great Man, the Old Man Above,
the One Above; attributing to him, however, as is usual in such cases,
nothing but the vaguest and most negative functions and qualities.  The
real practical power that most interested them, who had most to do with
them and they with him, was a demon, {349} or body of demons, of a
tolerably pronounced character.  In the face of divers assertions to
the effect that no such thing as a devil proper has ever been found in
savage mythology, we would draw attention to the following extract from
the Tomo manuscript of Mr. Powers--a gentleman who, both by his study
and by personal investigation, has made himself one of the best
qualified authorities on the belief of the native Californian, and
whose dealings have been for the most part with tribes that have never
had any friendly intercourse with white men.  Of course the thin and
meagre imagination of the American savages was not equal to the
creation of Milton's magnificent imperial Satan, or of Goethe's
Mephistopheles, with his subtle intellect, his vast powers, his
malignant mirth; but in so far as the Indian fiends or devils have the
ability, they are wholly as wicked as these.  They are totally bad,
they have no good thing in them, they think only evil; but they are
weak and undignified and absurd; they are as much beneath Satan as the
'Big Indians' who invent them are inferior in imagination to John
Milton.

"A definite location is generally assigned to the evil one as his
favourite residence or resort; thus the Californians in the county of
Siskiyou give over Devil's Castle, its mount and lake, to the malignant
spirits, and avoid the vicinity of these places with all possible care.

"The coast tribes of Del Norte County, California, live in constant
terror of a malignant spirit that takes the form of certain animals,
the form of a bat, of a hawk, of a tarantula, and so on, but especially
delights in and affects that of a screech-owl.  The belief of the
Russian river tribes and others is practically identical with this.

"The Cahrocs have some conception of a great {350} deity called
Chareya, the Old Man Above; he is wont to appear upon earth at times to
some of the most favoured sorcerers; he is described as wearing a close
tunic, with a medicine-bag, and as having long white hair that falls
venerably about his shoulders.  Practically, however, the Cahrocs, like
the majority of Californian tribes, venerate chiefly the Coyote.  Great
dread is also had of certain forest-demons of nocturnal habits; these,
say the Cahrocs, take the form of bears, and shoot arrows at benighted
wayfarers.

"Between the foregoing outlines of Californian belief and those
connected with the remaining tribes, passing south, we can detect no
salient difference till we reach the Olchones, a coast tribe between
San Francisco and Monterey; the sun here begins to be connected, or
identified by name, with that great spirit, or rather, that Big Man,
who made the earth and who rules in the sky.  So we find it again both
around Monterey and around San Luis Obispo; the first fruits of the
earth were offered in these neighbourhoods to the great light, and his
rising was greeted with cries of joy."

Father Gerónimo Boscana gives us the following account of the faith and
worship of the Acagchemem tribes, who inhabit the valley and
neighbourhood of San Juan Capistrano, California.  We give first the
version held by the _serranos_, or highlanders, of the interior
country, three or four leagues inland from San Juan Capistrano:

"Before the material world at all existed there lived two beings,
brother and sister, of a nature that cannot be explained; the brother
living above, and his name meaning the Heavens, the sister living
below, and her name signifying Earth.  From the union of these two
there sprang a numerous offspring.  Earth and sand were the
first-fruits of this marriage; then were born {351} rocks and stones;
then trees, both great and small; then grass and herbs; then animals;
lastly was born a great personage called Ouiot, who was a 'grand
captain.'  By some unknown mother many children of a medicine race were
born to this Ouiot.  All these things happened in the north; and
afterwards when men were created they were created in the north; but as
the people multiplied they moved toward the south, the earth growing
larger also and extending itself in the same direction.

"In process of time, Ouiot becoming old, his children plotted to kill
him, alleging that the infirmities of age made him unfit any longer to
govern them or attend to their welfare.  So they put a strong poison in
his drink, and when he drank of it a sore sickness came upon him; he
rose up and left his home in the mountains, and went down to what is
now the seashore, though at that time there was no sea there.  His
mother, whose name is the Earth, mixed him an antidote in a large
shell, and set the potion out in the sun to brew; but the fragrance of
it attracted the attention of the Coyote, who came and overset the
shell.  So Ouiot sickened to death, and though he told his children
that he would shortly return and be with them again, he has never been
seen since.  All the people made a great pile of wood and burnt his
body there, and just as the ceremony began the Coyote leaped upon the
body, saying that he would burn with it; but he only tore a piece of
flesh from the stomach and ate it and escaped.  After that the title of
the Coyote was changed from Eyacque, which means Sub-captain, to Eno,
that is to say, Thief and Cannibal.

"When now the funeral rites were over, a general council was held and
arrangements made for collecting animal and vegetable food; for up to
this time the {352} children and descendants of Ouiot had nothing to
eat but a kind of white clay.  And while they consulted together,
behold a marvellous thing appeared before them, and they spoke to it,
saying: 'Art thou our captain, Ouiot?'  But the spectre said: 'Nay, for
I am greater than Ouiot; my habitation is above, and my name is
Chinigchinich.'  Then he spoke further, having been told for what they
were come together: 'I create all things, and I go now to make man,
another people like unto you; as for you, I give you power, each after
his kind, to produce all good and pleasant things.  One of you shall
bring rain, and another dew, and another make the acorn grow, and
others other seeds, and yet others shall cause all kinds of game to
abound in the land; and your children shall have this power for ever,
and they shall be sorcerers to the men I go to create, and shall
receive gifts of them, that the game fail not and the harvests be
sure.'  Then Chinigchinich made man; out of the clay of the lake he
formed him, male and female; and the present Californians are the
descendants of the one or more pairs there and thus created.

"So ends the known tradition of the mountaineers; we must now go back
and take up the story anew at its beginning, as told by the _playanos_,
or people of the valley of San Juan Capistrano.  These say that an
invisible, all-powerful being, called Nocuma, made the world and all
that it contains of things that grow and move.  He made it round like a
ball and held it in his hands, where it rolled about a good deal at
first, till he steadied it by sticking a heavy black rock called Tosaut
into it, as a kind of ballast.  The sea was at this time only a little
stream running round the world, and so crowded with fish that their
twinkling fins had no longer room to move; so great was the press that
{353} some of the more foolish fry were for effecting a landing and
founding a colony upon the dry land, and it was only with the utmost
difficulty that they were persuaded by their elders that the killing
air and baneful sun and the want of feet must infallibly prove the
destruction before many days of all who took part in such a desperate
enterprise.  The proper plan was evidently to improve and enlarge their
present home; and to this end, principally by the aid of one very large
fish, they broke the great rock Tosaut in two, finding a bladder in the
centre filled with a very bitter substance.  The taste of it pleased
the fish, so they emptied it into the water, and instantly the water
became salt and swelled up and overflowed a great part of the old
earth, and made itself the new boundaries that remain to this day.

"Then Nocuma created a man, shaping him out of the soil of the earth,
calling him Ejoni.  A woman also the great god made, presumably out of
the same material as the man, calling her Aé.  Many children were born
to this first pair, and their descendants multiplied over the land.
The name of one of these last was Sirout, that is to say, Handful of
Tobacco, and the name of his wife was Ycaiut, which means Above; and to
Sirout and Ycaiut was born a son, while they lived in a place
north-east about eight leagues from San Juan Capistrano.  The name of
this son was Ouiot, that is to say, Dominator; he grew a fierce and
redoubtable warrior; haughty, ambitious, tyrannous, he extended his
lordship on every side, ruling everywhere as with a rod of iron; and
the people conspired against him.  It was determined that he should die
by poison; a piece of the rock Tosaut was ground up in so deadly a way
that its mere external application was sufficient to cause death.
Ouiot, notwithstanding that {354} he held himself constantly on the
alert, having been warned of his danger by a small burrowing animal
called the _cucumel_, was unable to avoid his fate; a few grains of the
cankerous mixture were dropped upon his breast while he slept, and the
strong mineral ate its way to the very springs of his life.  All the
wise men of the land were called to his assistance; but there was
nothing for him save to die.  His body was burned on a great pile with
songs of joy and dances, and the nation rejoiced.

"While the people were gathered to this end, it was thought advisable
to consult on the feasibility of procuring seed and flesh to eat
instead of the clay which had up to this time been the sole food of the
human family.  And while they yet talked together, there appeared to
them, coming they knew not whence, one called Attajen, 'which name
implies man, or rational being.'  And Attajen, understanding their
desires, chose out certain of the elders among them, and to these gave
he power; one that he might cause rain to fall, to another that he
might cause game to abound, and so with the rest, to each his power and
gift, and to the successors of each for ever.  These were the first
medicine-men."

Many years having elapsed since the death of Ouiot, there appeared in
the same place one called Ouiamot, reputed son of Tacu and
Auzar--people unknown, but natives, it is thought by Boscana, of "some
distant land."  This Ouiamot is better known by his great name
Chinigchinich, which means Almighty.  He first manifested his powers to
the people on a day when they had met in congregation for some purpose
or other; he appeared dancing before them crowned with a kind of high
crown made of tall feathers stuck into a circlet of some kind, girt
with a {355} kind of petticoat of feathers, and having his flesh
painted black and red.  Thus decorated he was called the _tobet_.
Having danced some time, Chinigchinich called out the medicine-men, or
_puplems_, as they were called, among whom it would appear the chiefs
are always numbered, and confirmed their power; telling them that he
had come from the stars to instruct them in dancing and all other
things, and commanding that in all their necessities they should array
themselves in the _tobet_, and so dance as he had danced, supplicating
him by his great name, that thus they might be granted their petitions.
He taught them how to worship him, how to build _vanquechs_, or places
of worship, and how to direct their conduct in various affairs of life.
Then he prepared to die, and the people asked him if they should bury
him; but he warned them against attempting such a thing.  "If ye buried
me," he said, "ye would tread upon my grave, and for that my hand would
be heavy upon you; look to it, and to all your ways, for lo, I go up
where the high stars are, where mine eyes shall see all the ways of
men; and whosoever will not keep my commandments nor observe the things
I have taught, behold, disease shall plague all his body, and no food
shall come near his lips, the bear shall rend his flesh, and the
crooked tooth of the serpent shall sting him."

In Lower California the Pericues were divided into two _gentes_, each
of which worshipped a divinity which was hostile to the other.  The
tradition explains that there was a great lord in heaven, called
Niparaya, who made earth and sea, and was almighty and invisible.  His
wife was Anayicoyondi, a goddess who, though possessing no body, bore
him in a divinely mysterious manner three children, one of whom,
Quaayayp, was a real man and born on earth, on the Acaragui {356}
mountains.  Very powerful this young god was, and for a long time he
lived with the ancestors of the Pericues, whom it is almost to be
inferred that he created; at any rate we are told that he was able to
make men, drawing them up out of the earth.  The men at last killed
their great hero and teacher, and put a crown of thorns upon his head.
Somewhere or other he remains lying dead to this day; and he remains
constantly beautiful, neither does his body know corruption.  Blood
drips constantly from his wounds; and though he can speak no more,
being dead, yet there is an owl that speaks to him.

The other god was called Wac, or Tuparan.  According to the Niparaya
sect, this Wac had made war on their favourite god, and had been by him
defeated and cast forth from heaven into a cave under the earth, of
which cave the whales of the sea were the guardians.  With a perverse,
though not unnatural, obstinacy, the sect that took Wac or Tuparan for
their great god persisted in holding ideas peculiar to themselves with
regard to the truth of the foregoing story, and their account of the
great war in heaven and its results differed from the other as differ
the creeds of heterodox and orthodox everywhere; they ascribe, for
example, part of the creation to other gods besides Niparaya.


Myths of the Athapascans

The great Athapascan family, who inhabit a vast extent of territory
stretching north from the fifty-fifth parallel nearly to the Arctic
Ocean, and westward to the Pacific, with cognate ramifications to the
far south, are weak in mythological conceptions.  Regarding them
Bancroft says:[4]


[4] _The Native Races of the Pacific States_, vol. iii.


{357}

"They do not seem in any of their various tribes to have a single
expressed idea with regard to a supreme power.  The Loucheux branch
recognize a certain personage, resident in the moon, whom they
supplicate for success in starting on a hunting expedition.  This being
once lived among them as a poor ragged boy that an old woman had found
and was bringing up; and who made himself ridiculous to his fellows by
making a pair of very large snow-shoes; for the people could not see
what a starveling like him should want with shoes of such unusual size.
Times of great scarcity troubled the hunters, and they would often have
fared badly had they not invariably on such occasions come across a new
broad trail that led to a head or two of freshly killed game.  They
were glad enough to get the game and without scruples as to its
appropriation; still they felt curious as to whence it came and how.
Suspicion at last pointing to the boy and his great shoes as being in
some way implicated in the affair, he was watched.  It soon became
evident that he was indeed the benefactor of the Loucheux, and the
secret hunter whose quarry had so often replenished their empty pots;
yet the people were far from being adequately grateful, and continued
to treat him with little kindness or respect.  On one occasion they
refused him a certain piece of fat--him who had so often saved their
lives by his timely bounty!  That night the lad disappeared, leaving
only his clothes behind, hanging on a tree.  He returned to them in a
month, however, appearing as a man, and dressed as a man.  He told them
that he had taken up his home in the moon; that he would always look
down with a kindly eye to their success in hunting; but he added that
as a punishment for their shameless greed and ingratitude in refusing
him the piece of fat, all animals {358} should be lean the long winter
through, and fat only in summer; as has since been the case.

"According to Hearne, the Tinneh believe in a kind of spirits, or
fairies, called _nantena_, which people the earth, the sea, and the
air, and are instrumental for both good and evil.  Some of them believe
in a good spirit called Tihugun, 'my old friend,' supposed to reside in
the sun and in the moon; they have also a bad spirit, Chutsain,
apparently only a personification of death, and for this reason called
bad.

"They have no regular order of _shamans_; any one when the spirit moves
him may take upon himself their duties and pretensions, though some by
happy chances, or peculiar cunning, are much more highly esteemed in
this regard than others, and are supported by voluntary contributions.
The conjurer often shuts himself in his tent and abstains from food for
days till his earthly grossness thins away, and the spirits and things
unseen are constrained to appear at his behest.  The young Tinneh care
for none of these things; the strong limb and the keen eye, holding
their own well in the jostle of life, mock at the terrors of the
invisible; but as the pulses dwindle with disease or age, and the knees
strike together in the shadow of impending death, the _shaman_ is hired
to expel the evil things of which a patient is possessed.  Among the
Tacullies a confession is often resorted to at this stage, on the truth
and accuracy of which depend the chances of a recovery."


Conclusion

In concluding this survey of representative myths of the Red Race of
North America, the reader will probably be chiefly impressed with the
circumstance that although many of these tales exhibit a striking {359}
resemblance to the myths of European and Asiatic peoples they have yet
an atmosphere of their own which strongly differentiates them from the
folk-tales of all other races.  It is a truism in mythology that
although the tales and mythological systems of peoples dwelling widely
apart may show much likeness to one another, such a resemblance cannot
be advanced as a proof that the divergent races at some distant period
possessed a common mythology.  Certain tribes in Borneo live in huts
built on piles driven into lake-beds and use blow-pipes; so do some
Indians of Guiana and contiguous countries; yet no scientist of
experience would be so rash as to advance the theory that these races
possessed a common origin.  It is the same with mythological processes,
which may have been evolved separately at great distances, but yet
exhibit a marked likeness.  These resemblances arise from the
circumstance that the mind of man, whether he be situated in China or
Peru, works on surprisingly similar lines.  But, as has been indicated,
the best proof that the myths of North America have not been
sophisticated by those of Europe and Asia is the circumstance that the
aboriginal atmosphere they contain is so marked that even the most
superficial observer could not fail to observe its presence.  In the
tales contained in this volume the facts of Indian life, peculiar and
unique, enter into every description and are inalienably interwoven
with the matter of the story.

In closing, the author desires to make a strong appeal for a reasoned
and charitable consideration of the Indian character on the part of his
readers.  This noble, manly, and dignified race has in the past been
grossly maligned, chiefly by persons themselves ignorant and inspired
by hereditary dislike.  The Red Man is neither a monster of inhumanity
nor a marvel {360} of cunning, but a being with like feelings and
aspirations to our own.  Because his customs and habits of thought
differ from ours he has been charged with all manner of crimes and
offences with which he has, in general, nothing to do.  We do not deny
that he was, till very recent times, a savage, with the habits and
outlook of a savage.  But that he ever was a demon in human shape must
be strenuously denied.  In the march of progress Indian men and women
are to-day taking places of honour and emolument side by side with
their white fellow-citizens, and many gifted and cultured persons of
Indian blood have done good work for the race.  Let us hope that the
ancient virtues of courage and endurance which have stood the Indian
people in such good stead of old will assist their descendants in the
even more strenuous tasks of civilization to which they are now called.

NOTE ON PRONUNCIATION

Workers in Indian mythology and linguistics have in some instances
created a phonology of their own for the several languages in which
they wrought.  But, generally speaking, the majority of Indian names,
both of places and individuals, should be pronounced as spelt, the
spelling being that of persons used to transcribing native diction and
as a rule representing the veritable Indian pronunciation of the word.

Among the North American Indians we find languages both harsh and soft.
Harshness produced by a clustering of consonants is peculiar to the
north-west coast of America, while the Mississippi basin and California
possess languages rich in sonorous sounds.  A slurring of terminal
syllables is peculiar to many American tongues.

The vocabularies of American languages are by no means scanty, as is
often mistakenly supposed, and their grammatical structure is intricate
and systematic.  The commonest traits in American languages are the
vagueness of demarcation between the noun and verb, the use of the
intransitive form of the verb for the adjective, and the compound
character of independent pronouns.  A large number of ideas are
expressed by means of either affixes or stem-modification.  On account
of the frequent occurrence of such elements American languages have
been classed as 'polysynthetic.'
