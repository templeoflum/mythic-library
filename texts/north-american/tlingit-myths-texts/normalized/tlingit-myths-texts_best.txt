same time asthematerial contained inthewriter spaper onthe
Social Condition, Beliefs, andLinguistic RelationshipoftheTlingit
Indians publishedintheTwenty-sixth Annual ReportoftheBureau.
Forfurther information regarding these peoplethereader isreferred
tothat paper,toKrause sTlinkit Indianer (Jena, 1885),Emmons
BasketryoftheTlingit Indians, Niblack sCoast Indians ofSouthern
Alaska andNorthern British Columbia, Ball sAlaska and itsResources,

mittee Appointed bytheBritish Association fortheAdvancement of
Science, toInvestigatetheNorthwestern Tribes ofCanada, andthe
twospecial reports onAlaska forthecensuses of1880and 1890.
Most oftheethnologic information contained intheworks ofVenia-
minoff andother earlywriters isincorporatedintothework ofKrause.
Stories7,19,94,101,102,and103were related bythewriter sSitka
interpreter, DonCameron, oftheChilkat KagwAntan;stories 96and97
byKatlian, chief oftheKiksA di;story105byaYakutat man,
QladAstin; and alltheother Sitka stories, including thetextsnum

MYTHS RECORDED INENGLISH ATSITKA
1.RAVENa
Nooneknowsjusthow thestoryofRavenreally begins,soeach
starts from thepoint where hedoesknow it.Here itwasalways
beguninthisway. Raven was first called Kit-kaositiyi-qa-yit
(&quot;Son ofKit-kaositiyi-qa&quot;). When hissonwasborn, Kit-kaositiyi-
qatried toinstruct himandtrainhimineverywayand, afterhegrew
up,toldhimhewould givehimstrength tomake aworld. After
tryinginallsorts ofwaysRavenfinally succeeded. Then there
wTasnolightinthisworld, but itwastoldhimthat faruptheNass
wasalarge house inwhich some onekept light justforhimself.
Raven thought over allkinds ofplansforgettingthislight into
theworld andfinally hehitonagoodone. Therichmanlivingthere
hadadaughter, andhethought,&quot;Iwillmake myself very small and
dropintothewater intheform ofasmallpieceof dirt.&quot; Thegirl
swallowed thisdirtandbecame pregnant. When hertimewascom
pleted, theymade ahole forher,aswascustomary,inwhich shewas
tobring forth, andlined itwith richfurs ofallsorts. Butthechild
didnotwish tobebornonthose finethings. Then itsgrandfather
feltsadand said, &quot;What doyouthink itwould bebest toputinto
that hole? Shallweputinmoss?&quot; Sotheyputmoss inside and
thebabywasbom on it. Itseyeswere very bright andmoved
aroundrapidly.
Round bundles ofvarying shapes andsizeshung about onthewalls
ofthehouse. When thechildbecame alittlelargeritcrawled around
back ofthepeople weeping continually, andasitcried itpointedto
thebundles. This lasted many days. Then itsgrandfather said,
&quot;Givemygrandchild what heiscryingfor.Givehimthatonehang
ingontheend. That isthebagof stars.&quot; Sothechild played with
this, rollingitabout onthefloorback ofthepeople,until suddenly
helet itgoupthroughthesmoke hole. Itwent straight upinto
theskyandthestars scattered outofit,arranging themselves as
younow seethem. That waswhat hewent there for.
Some time after thishebegan crying again, andhecried somuch
that itwasthought hewould die .Then hisgrandfather said,&quot;Untie
thenextoneandgiveitto him.&quot; Heplayed andplayed with it
around behind hismother. After awhile heletthatgoupthrough
thesmoke hole also,andtherewasthebigmoon.

Nowjustonethingmore remained, theboxthatheldthedaylight,
andhecried forthat. Hiseyesturned around andshowed different
colors, andthepeople began thinkingthathemust besomething
other thananordinary baby. But italways happensthatagrand
father loves hisgrandchild justashedoes hisown-daughter,sothe
grandfather said,&quot;Untie thelastthing andgiveitto him.&quot; His
grandfatherfeltverysadwhen hegavethistohim.When thechild
had this inhishands, heuttered theravencry, &quot;Ga,&quot; andflewout
with itthroughthesmoke hole. Then theperson fromwhom hehad
stolen itsaid,&quot;That oldmanuring raven hasgottenallofmy things.&quot;
Journeying on,Raven wastold ofanotherplace, where amanhad
aneverlasting springofwater. Thismanwasnamed Petrel (GAnu k).
Raven wanted thiswater because there wasnone todrink inthis
world, butPetrel always sleptbyhisspring, andhehadacover over
itsoastokeepitalltohimself. ThenRaven came inandsaid to
him, &quot;My brother-in-law, Ihavejustcome toseeyou.How are
you?&quot; Hetold Petrel ofallkinds ofthingsthatwerehappening
outside, tryingtoinduce him togoouttolook atthem, butPetrel
wastoosmart forhimandrefused.
When night came, Ravensaid,&quot;Iamgoingtosleep with you,
brother-in-law.&quot; Sotheywent tobed,andtoward morning Raven
heard Petrelsleeping very soundly. Then hewent outside, took
some dogmanure andputitaround Petrel sbuttocks. When itwas
beginningtogrow light, hesaid,&quot;Wakeup,wakeup,wakeup,brother1
in-law, youhave defecated alloveryourclothes.&quot; Petrel gotup,
looked athimself, andthoughtitwas true, sohetook hisblankets
andwent outside. ThenRaven went over toPetrel sspring, took off
thecover andbegan drinking. After hehaddrunk upalmost allof
thewater, Petrel came inandsawhim. ThenRaven flewstraight
up,crying&quot;Ga.&quot;
Before hegotthroughthesmoke hole, however, Petrelsaid, &quot;My
spirits upthesmoke hole, catch him.&quot; SoRaven stuck there, and
Petrel putpitchwood onthefireunder himsoastomake aquantityof
smoke. Raven waswhite before that time, butthesmoke madehim
ofthecoloryoufindhimto-day.Stillhedidnotdrop thewater.
When thesmoke-holespiritslethimgo,heflewaround thenearest
point andrubbed himself allover soastoclear offasmuch ofthesoot
aspossible.
Thishappened somewhere about theNass,andafterwards hestarted
upthisway.First heletsome water fallfrom hismouth andmade
theNass. Byandbyhespitmore outandmade theStikine. Next
hespitoutTakuriver, then Chilkat, thenAlsek, and alltheotherlarge
rivers. Thesmall drops thatcame outofhismouth made thesmall
salmon creeks.

After thisRaven went onagain andcame toalargetown where
were people whohadnever seendaylight. They were outcatching
eulachon inthedarkness when hecame tothebankopposite, and
heasked them totakehimacross buttheywould not.Then hesaid
tothem,&quot;Ifyoudon tcome over Iwillhavedaylight break onyou.&quot;Butthey answered, &quot;Where areyoufrom? Doyoucome from
faruptheNasswhere lives themanwhohasdaylight?&quot; Atthis
Raven openedhisboxjustalittle andshed sogreat alight on
them thattheywerenearly thrown down. Heshut itquickly, but
they quarreled withhim somuch across thecreek thathebecame
angry andopened theboxcompletely, when thesunflewupintothe
sky. Then thosepeople whohad sea-otter orfur-sealskins, orthe
skins ofanyother seaanimals, went intotheocean, while thosewho
hadland-otter, bear, ormartenskins, ortheskins ofanyother land
animals, went intothewoods[becomingtheanimals whose skinsthey
wore].
Raven came toanotherplace where acrowd ofboyswerethrowing
fatatoneanother. When theyhithimwith apiece heswallowed
it.After awhile hetookdogsmanure andthrew attheboyswho
became scared, ranaway, andthrew more fatathim.Heconsumed
allinthisway,andstarted onagain.
After awhile hecame toanabandoned camp wherelayapieceof
jade (s!u) halfburied intheground, onwhich somedesign hadbeen
pecked. This liedugup.Faroutinthebayhesawalarge spring
salmon jumping about andwanted togetitbutdidnotknow how.
Then hestuck hisstone intotheground andputeagledownuponthe
head designed thereon. Thenexttime thesalmon jumped, hesaid,
&quot;See here, spring salmon jumping outthere, doyouknow what this
green stone issayingtoyou?Itissaying, Youthing withdirty,
filthy back, youthing withdirty, filthy gills,come ashore here.&quot;
Raven suddenly wanted todefecate andstarted off. Just then
thebigspring salmon alsostarted tocome ashore, soRaven said,
&quot;Just wait,myfriend, don tcome ashore yetforIhavesome business
toattend to.&quot; Sothesalmon went outagain. Afterward Raven
tookapieceofwildcelery (yanaet) ,and,when thesalmon didcome
ashore, hestruck itwith thisand killed it.Because Raven made
thisjadetalktothesalmon, people have sincemade stone axes, picks,
andspears outofit.
Then Raven, carrying alongthespring salmon, gotallkinds of
birds,littleandbig,ashisservants. When hecame toagood place
tocook hisfishhesaid toallofthem, &quot;Here, youyoung fellows, go
afterskunkcabbage. Wewillburythisintheground androast it.&quot;
Aftertheyhadbroughtitdown, however, hesaid,&quot;Idon twantany
ofthat.Mywifehasdefecated allover that, andIwillnotuse it.
Goback andpass overtwo mountains.&quot; While they were gone,


6 BUEEAU OFAMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BULL. 39
Raven putallofthesalmon except onefatpiece cutfromaround the
&quot;navel&quot;awhich isusually cooked separately,intotheskunk cabbage
andburied itinthe fire. Before they returned, hedugthisupand
ateit,afterwhich heputthebones back intothe fireandcovered
them up.
When thebirds atlastcame back hesaid tothem,&quot;Ihavebeen
across twomountains myself. Now itistime todigitup.Digit
out.&quot; Then allcrowded around thefireanddug, but,whentheygot
itup,therewasnothing there butbones.
Byandbythebirds dressed oneanother indifferent wayssothat
theymight benamed from their dress. Theytiedthehair ofthe

Raven letoutthetsiegeniandtoldhimthatwhen thesalmon comes
hemust call itsslime unclean andstayhighupuntil thesalmon are
allgone.6
NowRaven started offwith thepieceofsalmonbellyandcame to
aplace where Bearand hiswife lived. Heentered andsaid, &quot;My
aunt sson,isthisyou? Thepieceofsalmon hehadburied behind
alittlepoint.ThenBear toldhimtositdown andsaid,&quot;Iwillroast
somedrysalmon foryou.&quot; Sohebegantoroast it.After itwasdone,
hesetadish close tothe fireand slittheback ofhishands with a
knife soastoletgreaserunoutforRaven toeatonhissalmon.
After hehadfixed thesalmon, hecutapieceofflesh outfrom in
front ofhisthighs andputitintothedish. That iswhy bears are
notfatinthatplace.
NowRaven wanted togiveadinner toBear inreturn, sohe,too,
took outapieceoffish,roastedit,setoutthedishBearhadused,
close tothefireand slituptheback ofhishand, thinkingthatgrease
would runoutofit.Butinstead nothing butwhite bubbles came
forth. Althoughheknew hecould notdoit,hetried inevery way.
ThenRaven asked Bear,&quot;Doyouknow ofanyhalibutfishing
groundout here?&quot; Hesaid &quot;No.&quot; Ravensaid, &quot;Why! what isthe
useofstaying herebythissaltwater,ifyoudonotknow ofanyfishing

ByandbyRaven gotthepieceoffishhehadhidden behind the
pointandwent outtothebank incompany withBearandCormorant.
Cormorant satinthebow,Bear inthemiddle, and,because heknew
where thefishing ground was,Raven steered. When they arrived

After awhileRaven said toCormorant,&quot;There isalousecoming
down ontheside ofyour head. Come here. Letmetake it off.&quot;
When hecame close tohim,hepickeditoff.Then hesaid, &quot;Open
yourmouth sothat Icanputitonyour tongue.&quot; When hedidopen
hismouth, however, Raven reached farbackandpulledhistongue out.
Hedidthisbecause hedidnotwantCormorant totellabout what he
haddone. HetoldCormorant tospeak, butCormorant made onlya
gabblingnoise. &quot;That ishowyoungfellows oughttospeak/said
Raven. ThenRaven towed thedeadbodyofthebearbehind the
point andcarried itashore there. Afterwards hewent toBear swife
andbegantotake out hishalibut. Hesaid tothefemalebear,
&quot;Myfather ssister, cutout allthestomachs ofthehalibut androast
them.&quot; Soshewentdown onthebeach tocutthem out. While
shewasworking ontherest ofthehalibut, hecooked thestomachs
and filledthem withhotrocks. Then hewentdown andsaidtoher,
&quot;You better come up.Ihave cooked allthose stomachs foryou.
Youbetter washyour hands, come up,and eat.&quot; After thatCormo
rantcame inand tried totellwhat hadhappened butmade only a
gabbling sound. Raven said tothebear,&quot;Doyouknow what that
fellow istalking about ?He issayingthat there were lotsofhalibut
outwhere wefished. Every timewetried togetacanoe loadthey
almost turned us over.&quot; When shewasabout toeathesaid, &quot;People

began sheasked Raven where herhusband was,andRaven said,
lSomehow orother hecaught nothing,sowelanded himbehind the

thereyet.&quot;
After thebearhadswallowed allofthefood shebegantofeel
uneasyinherstomach, andRaven saidtoCormorant,&quot;Run outside
quickly andgethersome water.&quot; Then shedrank agreat quantity

him,buthesaid, &quot;Keep away, yousmallCormorant,&quot; andstruck
himonthebuttocks with hishand saying,&quot;Gooutandstayonthose
rocks.&quot; Ever since then thecormorants have been there. Raven
stayedinthatplaceuntil hehadconsumed both ofthebears.
Starting onagain, Raven came toaplace wheremany people were
encamped fishing. They usednothing butfatforbait.Heentered
ahouse andasked whi*t they used forbait. Theysaid &quot;Fat.&quot;
Then hesaid,&quot;Letmeseeyouputenough onyourhooks forbait,&quot;
andhenoticed carefully howthey baited andhandled their- hooks.
Thenexttimetheywent out,hewalked offbehind apoint andwent
under water togetthis bait.Now they gotbites andpulled up
quickly,buttherewasnothing ontheir hooks. Thiscontinued fora
longtime. Thenexttimetheywent outtheyfeltthething again,
butonemanamong themwhoknewjusthow fishbite, jerkedatthe
rightmoment and feltthathehadcaught something. The linewent
around inthewater veryfast. They pulled away, however, until
they gotRaven under thecanoe, andhekickedagainstitvery hard.
Allatonce hisnosecameoff,andthey pulleditup.Whenthey
landed, theytook ittothechief shouse andsaid,&quot;Wehavecaught a
wonderfulthing.Itmust bethenose oftheGonaqAdet.&quot;Sothey
tookit,puteagledown onit,andhungituponthewall.
After that,Raven came ashore attheplace where hehadbeen in
thehabit ofgoing down, gotalotofspruce gumandmade anew
noseoutofit.Then hedrew aroothatdown over hisfaceandwent
tothetown. Beginning atthenearer endhewent through the
housessaying&quot;Iwonder inwhat house arethepeople whocaught

thechief shouse andinquired,&quot;Doyouknow where arethepeople

Going thence, Raven saw anumber ofdeerwalking around on
thebeach, with agreat deal offathanging outthrough their noses.
Ashepassed oneofthese, hesaid, &quot;Brother, youbetter blowyour
nose. Lots ofdirt ishanging outof it.&quot;When thedeerwould not

NowRaven formed acertainplan. Hegotasmall canoe and

yourself, AxkwA iJi.&quot;ByandbyRaven said&quot;Notveryfarfrom here
myfather hasbeenmaking acanoe. Letusgothereandlook at it.&quot;
ThenRaven brought him toalarge valley. Hetookverymany
piecesofdried wildcelery and laidthem across thevalley, covering
them with moss. SaidRaven,&quot;AxkwAiJi,watch me,AxkwAiJi,
watch me.&quot; Repeatingthisoverandoverhewentstraight across on
it,forheislight. Afterwards hesaid toDeer,&quot;AxkwAiJi,now
youcome andtryit. Itwillnotbreak,&quot; andhecrossed oncemore.
&quot;You bettertryitnow,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Come on over.&quot; Deer didso,
but, ashewasontheway, hebroke throughthebridge andsmashed
hishead topiecesatthebottom. ThenRaven went down, walked
alloverhim,andsaid tohimself,&quot;Iwonder where Ibetter start, at
theroot ofhistail,attheeyes,oratthe heart.&quot; Finally hebeganat
hisanus, skinningashewentalong. Heateveryfast.
When hestarted onfrom thisplace, hebegan crying,&quot;AxkwAiJi-i-i,
AxkwAiJi-I-I,&quot; andthefowls asked him,&quot;What hasbecome ofyour
friend, AxkwA iJi?&quot; &quot;Some onehastakenhimandpounded himon

he died.&quot;
Byandbyhecame toacertain cliffandsawadoor initswing

Raven sawsomekelp, and,going outtothis,heclimbed down onitto

again said,&quot;Onwhat tide didyougetthose seaurchins youare

Sheanswered &quot;Yes.&quot; Because Raven didthiswhile hewasmaking

After thetidehadgonedown veryfarheandhisservant went out.
HesaidtoMink,&quot;Thethingthat willbeyourfoodfromnowonisthe

NowRaven started onfrom thisplace crying, &quot;My wife,mywife!&quot;
Comingtosome trees, hesawalotofgumononeofthemandsaid to

After thishegotacanoe andbegan paddling along. Byandby
Petrel methiminanother canoe. Sohebroughthiscanoealongside

Heanswered,&quot;Iamfrom over there.&quot; ThenRaven began toques

&quot;When wereyouborn?&quot; &quot;Iwasborn before thisworld was known.&quot;
&quot;That isjustalittle while back.&quot;
Theytalked backandforth untiltheybecame very angry. Then
Petrel pushed Raven scanoe away fromhimandputonhishat

SaidRaven, &quot;I,i.&quot;Hedidnot like itatall. After Petrel had

Leavingthisplace, Raven came toanother where hesawsome
thing floating notfarfromshore, thoughitnever came anynearer.
Heassembled allkinds offowl. Towardevening helooked atthe
object andsawthat itresembled fire. Sohetoldachicken hawk
(kA!ku

chicken hawk reached theplace, seized some fireandstarted back
asfastasitcouldfly,butbythetime itgotthe firetoRaven its
billwasburned off.That iswhyitsbill isshort. Then Raven
tooksome redcedar, andsome white stones calledneq!which are
found onthebeach, andheputfireintothem sothat itcould be
found everafterward allover theworld.
After hehad finisheddistributing the firehestarted onagain
andcame toatown where there weremany people. Hesawwhat

Afterward hewent tothemiddle ofthetown andsaid,&quot;Iam

tobeatdrums. Then heheld thecane inhishands andmoved it
aroundhorizontally, testingit.Hekeptsaying &quot;Up, up, up.&quot;aHe
said,&quot;Ihave never given anyfeast formymother, and itistime I
didit,butIhave nothing withwhich togive afeast. Therefore I
made thiscane, and Iamgoing togiveafeast formymother with

Then hegotthepeoplealldown onthebeach andextended his

After thiswasoverhethought upaplotagainst thekiller whales
andsentaninvitation tothem. Then hetoldeach ofhispeople
tomake acane thatwould reach verymuch above hishead. So,
when thekiller whales came inandinquired,&quot;What dothepeople
usethose canes forthatextend upover theirheads?&quot;, hereplied,
&quot;Theystickthemdown intotheir heads.&quot; They asked himseveral
times, andhereplied each time inthesameway. After awhile
oneofthewhales said, &quot;Suppose wetryit.&quot;Raven wasgladto
hear thatandsaid,&quot;Allright,wewilltryitwithyoupeople, but
thepeopleIhave invited must notlookwhen Iputacane into
anyoneshead.&quot; Then hewent away andwhittled anumber of
sticks untiltheywerevery sharp. After thathelaid allofthekiller
whales onthebeach atshort distances apart, andagain hetoldthem
nottolookupwhile hewasshowing onehow itwasdone. Then he
took ahammer ormaulanddrove hissticks intothenecks ofthese
whales oneafter theother sothattheydied. Butthelastone
happened tolookup,sawwhatwasbeing done, andjumped intothe
ocean.
a[NowRaven andanother personstarted toboiloutthekiller-

dreamed adream which informed himthat alotofpeople were

themanreturned, threwRaven intoagrease box,andshuthimin,
andstarted totie itupwith astrong rope. ThenRaven called
out,&quot;Mybrother, donot tietheboxupvery strongly. Tie itwith a
pieceofstraw such asourforefathers used to use.&quot; Theman did
so,afterwhich hetook theboxuponahighcliffandkicked itover.
ThenRaven, breaking thestraw, flewout,cryingGa.&quot;When hegot
totheother sideofthepoint, healighted andbegan wiping himself.]
Next hecame toalargewhale biowing along outatsea,andnoticed
thatevery time itcame up,itsmouth waswide open. ThenRaven
took aknife andsomething withwhich tomake fire.When the
whale cameupagain heflew into itsmouth and satdown atthe
farther endofitsstomach. Near theplacewhere hehadentered he
sawsomething thatlooked likeanoldwoman. Itwasthewhale s
uvula (Anu t!ayi). When thewhale came up,itmade abignoise, the
uvula went toonesideandtheherring andother fish itlivedon
poured rightin.ThenRaven began eatingallthese things thatthe
whale hadswallowed, and, presently, hemade afiretocook thefat
ofthewhale itself thathunginside. Last ofallheatetheheart.
Assoon ashecutoutthis, thewhale threw itself about inthewater
andsoon floated updead. Raven felt thisandsaid,&quot;Iwisli it

many times, thewhale begantodriftalong, and itfinally floated
ashore onalongsandy beach.
After awhilesomeyoung fellows whowerealways shooting about
inthisneighborhood with theirbows andarrows, heard avoice on
thebeachsay,&quot;Iwonder who willmake aholeonthetopsothat

&quot;We heard aqueernoise. Something floated ashore notfarfrom
thisplace, andapersoninsidesaid, Iwish thatsomebody would

assembled around thewhale andheard Raven swords very clearly.
They begantocutaholejustover theplace thesecame fromand
presently theyheard some oneinsidesay,&quot;Xone -e.&quot;When thehole
waslarge enough, Raven flewstraight upoutofituntilhewas lost
tosight. Andtheysaid tohim, &quot;Fly toanyplace where youwould
liketogo.&quot; After thatthey cutthewhale upandincourse oftime
came tothespotwhere Raven hadlightedhisfiretomake oil.
Meanwhile Raven flewback oftheircamptoalarge dead tree
thathadcrumbled into finepieces andbegan rubbing onittodry
himself. When hethought that thepeople were through making
oil,hedressed himself upwellandrepairedtothetown. There he
said tothepeople,&quot;Was anything heard inthat tclan (hisword for
whale)?&quot; andoneanswered, &quot;Yes, aqueernoisewasheard inside
ofthe whale.&quot; &quot;Iwonder what itwas,&quot; saidRaven.
After their foodwas allprepared Raven said tothepeople, &quot;Long
ago,when asound washeard inside ofatclan,allthepeople moved
out oftheir town soasnot tobekilled. Allwhoremained
were destroyed. Soyou better move from this town.&quot; Then all
ofthepeople said,&quot;All ofusbetter move from thistown rather
than bedestroyed.&quot; Sotheywent offleavingalloftheirthings,
andRaven promptly took possessionofthem.
Raven oncewent toacertainplaceoutside ofhere (Sitka) inhis
canoe. Itwascalm there, buthebegan rockingthecanoe upand

thepresent time, people have differed intheir opinions concerning
themonths andhave disputed withoneanother.
After theyhadquarreledover itforalong time, thegullbecame
angry,flewouttosea,andbrought back abigherring. Helighted
nearRaven and laidtheherringbeside him, but,whenRaven tried
toget it,hegulpeditdown. Inanother direction from theseagull
Raven sawalarge heron andwent over toit.Hesaid totheheron,
&quot;Seagulliscalling you Big-long-legs-always-walking-upon-the

theseagullandsaid,&quot;Doyouknowwhat thatheron issaying about
you? Hesaysthatyouhave abigstomach andgetyour redeyes

andIwillhelpyouthrash him.&quot; Sotheheron went overtoward the
seagull, and,when hecame close toit,Raven said,&quot;Kick himjust
under his stomach.&quot; Hedidso,and thebigherring came out.
ThenRaven swallowed itquickly saying,&quot;Just forthe Raven.&quot;
Going onagain, Raven came toacanoe inwhich weresome people
lying asleep along with abigsalmon which hetook away. When
thepeople awoke, theysawthetrailwhere hehaddraggeditoff,and
they followed him. They found himlying asleep bythe fireafter
having eaten thesalmon. Seeinghisgizzard hanging outathisbut
tocks, they twisted itoff,ranhome with itandused itasashinny
ball; this iswhynohuman beingnowhasagizzard.
Thepeople knew itwasRaven sgizzard,sothey liked toshow it

nowusedried salmon anddonotcaremuch forsalmoneggs.
Journeying on,Raven came toasealsitting ontheedgeofarock,
andhewanted toget it,butthesealjumped intotheocean. Then
hesaid, &quot;Y&kloGtU/Lf,&quot; because hewassosorry about it.Farther
onhecame toatownandwent behind ittowatch. After awhile a
mancame out,took alittle clubfrom acertainplace where hekept
itinconcealment, andsaid toit, &quot;Mylittle club, doyouseethat

little sealashore. Theclubwashangingtoitsneck. Then theman
took itupand said, &quot;Mylittle club,youhave donewell,&quot; after
which heputitback initsplace andreturned tothetown. Raven
sawwhere itwaskept, but firsthewent tothetown andspoke
kindlytotheowner ofit.Inthenight, however, whenevery onewas

andgetit.&quot;Buttheclubwould notgobecause itdidnotknow him.
After hehadtried togetittogoforsome time, hebecame angry and
said toit,&quot;Little club,don tyouseethat sealout there?&quot; Hekept
strikingitagainst arock until hebroke itinpieces.
Comingtoalarge bay,Raven talked toitinorder tomake itinto
Nass (i.e.,hewanted tomake itjustliketheNass), but,wlien the
tidewasoutgreatnumbers ofclams ontheflatsmade somuch noise
shooting upathimthat hisvoice wasdrowned, andhecould not

Aftermany attempts, hegaveitupandwentaway saying,&quot;Itried

Two brothers started tocross theStikine river, butRaven saw
themand said,&quot;Bestones there.&quot; Sotheybecame stones.
Starting on,hecame totheground-hog, peopleo.nthemainland.
Hismother haddiedsome time before this, and, ashehadnopro

When thetidebegantofall,allthepeople followed itdown, but
thetreesweregoneandtheyhadnothingtouseasfirewood, sotheyweredestroyed bythecold.When Raven camebackfromunder the
earth,ifhesawafish leftontopofamountain orinacreek, hesaid,
&quot;Stay right thereandbecome astone.&quot; Soitbecame astone. Ifhe
sawanyperson coming down, hewouldsay,&quot;Turn toastonejust
where you are,&quot;and itdidso.
After that theseawentdown sofarthat itwasdryeverywhere.ThenRaven went aboutpicking upthesmallestfish, asbullheads
and torncod,which hestrung onastick, while afriend whowas
withhim atthistime,named CAkUkvtooklarge creatures like
whales. With thegrease heboiledout,CAkU k11filled anentire
house, whileRaven filledonlyasmall bladder.
Raven stayed withCAklA k11andonenight hadadream. Hesaid
tohisfriend,&quot;Idreamed thatagreatenemy cameandattacked us.&quot;
Then hehad allthefowls assemble andcome tofight,sothat his
dream might befulfilled. Assoon asRaven had told hisdream,
CAklA k&quot;wentdown andsawthebirds. ThenRaven went intothe
house andbegan drinking uphisgrease. Butthemancameback,
sawwhatRaven wasdoing, andthrew himintoagrease box,which
hestarted totieupwith astrong rope. Raven, however, calledout,
&quot;My brother, donot tiemeupwith astrong rope, buttake astraw

drank upallthegreaseinthebox,and,when themantookhimupon

OnetimeRaven assembled allthebirds inpreparationforafeast
andhadthebears intherear ofhishouse asguests.Allthebirdshad

throughalltheworld insearch ofthingstoeat.
After allthehuman beings hadbeen destroyed Raven madenew
ones outofleaves. Because hemade thisnewgeneration, people
know thathemusthavechangedallofthefirstpeople whohadsur

leaves people alwaysdieoffrapidlyinthefalloftheyearwhen flowers
andleaves arefalling.
Atthetimewhen hemade thisworld, Raven made adevilfish
digging-stick andwent around toallcreatedthings (shellfish appar

either yesor no.&quot; Those that said &quot;No&quot; hepassed by;those that
said &quot;Yes&quot; herootedup.Hesaid tothepeople,&quot;When thetide

InRaven stime thebutts offerns (klwAlx) werealready cooked,
but, aftersomewomen hadbroughtseveral ofthesein,Raven broke a
stick overthefernroots. Therefore theybecamegreenlikethisstick.
Healsobroke therootsupintomany layers oneabove another.
Devilfish wereveryfatthen,andthepeople used tomakegrease out
ofthem, but,whenRaven came toaplace where theyweremaking
hesaid,&quot;Givemeapieceofthathardthing.&quot; That iswhyitsfat

3.ENGLISH VERSION OFTHESTORY OFTHEFOUR

There were four brothers whoowned adogofanAthapascan

paintinside ofhisblanket, took hisrattle, andfollowed. Theother
brothers went with him. They pursueditup,up,up,intothesky.
Thedogkeptonbarking, andtheydidnotknow what itwasgoing

When theygottotheother side oftheworld theycame outonthe

however, wentrightdown thecliff,andtheysawthecloud stillgoing

Then theysaid tooneanother, What shallwedo?Wemightas

started hewassmashed inpieces. Thetwonext fared inthesame
way. KAck !ArLk!,however, braced hisstickagainst thewallbehind
himandreached thebottom insafety. Then heputthebones of
each ofhisbrothers together, rubbed redpaint onthem, andshook
hisrattle overthem, andtheycame tolife.
Starting onagain around thisworld, theycame toacreek fullof
salmon. Thiswaswhere thedoghadbeen before. When they got

They hadhim sitbelow because hetalked somuch, andbecause he

That nighttheone-legged man didnotsleepatallonaccount of

Then hecried,uBringmyspearthisway.&quot; Although hesawnoone,
heknew that there were peopletherewhohad it.Then hecame to

heserved thenexttwobrothers. ButKAckU/Lk! hadhisdog,which
hew^asable tomake small, concealed under hiscoat and, after his
brothers were torn up,helet itgo,and ittorethebigman allto

therattle overthem sothattheycame tolife.
Nextmorning they gotintothesame treeagain. Then theysaw
amanwithtwoheads placed oneoveranother coming upthestream.
Itwasthebear chief. Hehooked agreatmany salmon andputthem

hecould hooknone atall,soLqlaya/k! caughtalotforhim. Then
Lqlayak!asked him:uWhat does thatdouble-head thatcame up

Toward evening agreatdeal ofnoisewasheardoutside, made over

Then itrolledrightbackagain. When itrolled back, thedogbecame
very angry,seized itasecond time, shook ithard, andthrew itso

together, putredpaint uponthem andshook hisrattle overthem.
Theycame tolifeagain. Then hetook thedog,made itsmall, and
putitunder hisarm; andtheystarted off. Since thattime people
havehadthekind ofspear (dma )above referred to.Thebrothers
started onwithit,and,whenever theywere hungry, they gotfood
\vith it.They always kept together.
After awhile theycame across some Athapascan Indians called
Worm-eating people (Wun-xa qoan). These were sonamed because,
when theykilled game, theyletworms feedupon it,and,when the
worms hadbecomebigenough, theyatethem throughholes inthe
middle oftheir foreheads which served them asmouths. Lqlayak !
wanted tobeamongthese Athapascans, because theyhadbows and
arrows andworequillsattached totheir hair. They used theirbows
andarrows toshoot caribou, and,when theywerepursuingthisanimal,
theyused toeatsnow.
After Lqlaya/k! hadobtained hisbowandarrows theycame out
atacertainplace, probablytheStikineriver, andstayed among
somepeople whowerewhipping oneanother forstrength,inthesea.
Every morning theywent intothewater with them.
Atthattimetheythought thatLqlayak !wasgoing with hissister,
andtheyputsome spruce gumaround theplace where sheslept.
Then theyfound thespruce gumonhimandcalled him allsorts of

Youcanbeathunder(hex!).&quot; They said tohim, &quot;Ha/agun kadi .&quot;a
This iswhy,when thunder isheard, people always say,&quot;You

sisterwasashamed. Shewentdown intoMount Edgecumbe (L!UX)

Because thethunder isaman,when thethunder isheard farout

Hemade these ofdifferent sorts. Ononehemarked white lines

When hefirstputthem intothewater heheaded themuptheinlet,

theywere tohunt forseal, halibut, and allotherthings under the

Before thispeopledidnotknow what thekiller whale is.
Another thing peopledidnotknow wasthatthekiller whale could
goashore andcamp. Onetime amanmarried ahigh-caste woman
andwentuptothehead ofacertain baywith her,because heknew
that thekiller whales always went there. Onthewaytheysawa

here,buthethought theywerehuman beings andlanded toseethem.
When they gotclosein,hejumpedintothewater tourinate. All

whohadconcealed herself behind herhusband, andcarried herdown
tothesea.They tookheraway because herhusband hadtaken their
provisions.This time,when thekiller whales roseagain, instead of

thehusband wentdown tohiscanoe, gotin,andpaddledafterthem

9.WOLVERINE-MAN
There were people livinginacertain townonthemainland. You
know that inolden times thepeopledidnotuseguns. They hunted
withbowsandarrows, andhornspears, and itwasveryhardwork to
usethem. So,when theywere going hunting, theyhadtofastand
wash theirheads inurine. That iswhy inallofthese stories which I
amtelling youjust astheywere told intheolden times foodwas
very scarce andhard toget. Success depended onwhatthings were
usedandhowpeople prepared themselves.
Onedayacertain man atthisplace began preparing himself by
washinghishead inurine, andthefollowing morning hedressed and
started upthevalley carryinghishornspear. Atthehead ofthis
valley hesawaflock ofmountainsheep, buthecould notgetatthem,
sohecampedovernight. Inthemorning hesawthat awolverine
(nusk) wasamong these sheep killing them off.
Next evening hereached thetopofthemountain andstarted into
thebrush tocamp, butcame toahouse with thedoorwideopenfor
him.Ontheinside hung piecesoffatfrom allkinds ofanimals the
wolverine had killed. Hewanted togoinverymuch, butinstead he
satdown inthebrush nearbyandwaited.
Presently amancame along carrying apack. ThiswasWolverine-
man(Nusgu-qa). Hesaid, &quot;My trader, youarehere.Whydon t

hisclothes andbegan wringing them outjustlikeahumanbeing.
Then heheated some hotrocks, took hishalfbasket, chopped upthe
bones ofaground hogandputthese into italong with thecooking
stones. Then hesaidtotheman,&quot;GivemethatkAndALa x.Give
methatklAxA kaok.&quot; These were hisownwords which hewas
teachingtothisman,andtheymean, Givememydish. Givememy
littlespoon.&quot; So,when onewentuptothetopofthismountain in
olden times hecalled hisdishes andspoons bythose names.

ThenWolverine-man placed thefoodbefore hisguest, but,when the
latter wasabout totakesome, Wolverine-man saidsomething that
sounded strangetohim.Hesaid,&quot;There heispickingitup.There

&quot;He isgettingcloser tothesmall bones. He isgetting closer tothe
small bones. He isgettingcloser tothesmall brother ofthebig

didnotwant theman toeatthesmall bones atthejoint/ and itwas
fromWolverine-man thatpeople learned nottoeatthese. Hesaid,
&quot;Iamnotsayingthis toyoubecause Ihate you.Ifanybody
swallows these, theweather isnotclearontopofthemountain. It
isalways foggy, andonecan killnothing. This iswhyIamtelling
you.&quot; Meanwhile thepeopleinthecamps hunted every dayforthis
manbutinvain.
ByandbyWolverine-man said tohim,&quot;Goaround totheother
side ofthemountain and sitdown where theground-hogs placesare.&quot;
Hewent there every day,butalways camehome without anything.
Wolverine-man, however, brought him agreat load every time.
Finally Wolverine-man toldhimtogoandcutofftwosmall limbs with
hisax.People generallycarried astone axwhen offhunting. With
these hemade atrapforhimandnamed itNever-lasting-over-night
(Lanka/klixe). Itwassonamed because itwascertain tocatch.
When theywentupnext day,Wolverine-man said,&quot;Iamgoing

Hesetitupmany times, andeachtimehecaughtone.Hekilled four
that day. That iswhy thetrapiscalled Never-lasting-over-night.
From thattimeonheincreased thesizeofhiscatch every day,while
Wolverine-man didnotcatch much. When hegothome with allhis
ground hogsWolverine-man laydownbythefireandbegan singing,
&quot;What Iwould have killed has allgoneover toalazyman sside.&quot;
Next morning, when theyagainstarted offtohunt, Wolverine-man,
instead ofcontinuing onhisusual route, came back toseewhat his
companion wasdoing. Then heclimbed into atree towatch him,
begantoplayaround inthetree,andafterwards suddenlyfelldown.
Hewanted todeceive thetrapper.This tree isa-small bushy one
called S!AX,and itisWolverine-man swifewithwhich hehadreally
been cohabiting. Theman, however, observed what hewasdoing,
andreturned home atonce,upon which Wolverine-man became so
ashamed thathelaydown andcovered himself with ashes.
After thatWolverine-man told hisguesttoliedown andcover

Now theman arose and said toWolverine-man,&quot;Iamgoing

where hehadbeenbuttokeephiminremembrance bymeans ofthe

when hewentdown, hehadabigpackofskins.
Then hebegantodistribute these toallhisfriends, telling them that
hehaddiscovered aplacewhere therewere lotsofthings, andthathe
hadatrapwhich never failed tokillground hogsandother animals if
setonthemountain overnight. When heexplainedtothepeople
how tosetupthistrap,amannamed Coward (QlAtxa n)said,&quot;I

placewhere Wolverine-man hadhelped himbutintooneofthelower
valleys where thereweremany ground hogs. There theyconstructed
ahouse outofdrysticks andbegan trapping. Coward hadunder

11.STORIES OFTHEMONSTER DEVILFISH AND
THECRY-BABY6
Many people oncewent toacertain camptodrysalmon. They
didnotknow thatabigdevilfish livedunder asteepcliffnotvery
farfrom thisplace.Inolden times, besides using hooks, theycaught
salmon bymeans oftraps (CA!), andwhen thetrapwasfull,they
would take outthefishandhangthem ondryingframes. When
these people hadmanyfishontheframes, theytook offtheir covers
sothat theredcolor shone outontheocean very distinctly.
Amanandhistwobrotherslivingatthiscamp werefond ofhunt
ing,andoneday,when verymany salmon wereontheframes, they
started out. While theywere gonethedevilfish sawtheglow on
thewater from theredsalmon, threw histentacles around thecamp
andswept every vestigeofitintothesea. Inthose times ahunter
washed inurine before going outhunting andwasthen sure tokill
something, butonthatdayeverythingthehunters speared got
away. When they returned tothecamp, theysawmany piecesof
canoesdrifting about thebay. Then theywereverysadonaccount
ofthelossoftheir friends, buttheydidnotknowwhathaddestroyed
them.
After theyhadremained there forfourdays, theytoldtheyoungest
toclimb tothetopofahighhillandwatch them. Then theeldest
told hisother brother tocutfouryoung spruce trees, andhesharp
ened these, making two forhimself andtwoforhisbrother. Early
inthemorning theyloaded their canoe with rocks andpreparedto
meet thedangerous animal. They went outinfront ofthehigh
cliffandbegan throwing rocks clown there, theelder sayingtohis
youngest brother,&quot;Look down.&quot;
After awhile theysawthelargedevilfish coming upright under
them. Then theytook thesharpenedsticks andbegantopierceits
flesh. Theyoungest watched allthathappened. When theircanoe
wasbroken up,theyclimbed ontopofthedevilfish andcontinued
runningthesticks into ituntil itdied.When thathappenedit
carried themdownalong with it.
Then theyoungest brother started offtofindsome settlement, and
when hecame toone, thepeoplesetoutatonce tolook forhis
brothers.Finally they discovered theplacetowhich thedevilfish
hadfloated, along with thehunters and their canoe. But itdid

15.BEAVER ANDPORCUPINE
Aporcupine andabeaver were onceveryclose friends.6They
traveled about everywhere andreportedtoeach other allthat

16.THEPOORMANWHOCAUGHT WONDERFUL THINGS
There wasalongtown fromwhich allthepeople used togoout
fishingforhalibut andotherlargefishevery day. Inthose times,
before bonewasused, theymade hooks oftwopiecesofspruce from
young trees, sharpenedthepoint andhardened itinthe fire. For
linesthey dried slenderkelpstems.
Averypoormanlivingatoneendofthetown fished among the

17.THEFINDING OFTHEBLUE PAINT, ANDHOWA
CERTAIN CREEK RECEIVED ITSNAME
AtSitka lived fourbrothers whowere veryfond ofhunting. In
those days peopleliked tohunt about thestraits north ofSitka for
furseals, seaotters, etc.Oneday, while theywere out,theywere
forced totakerefuge from astorm ataplace nearMount Edgecumbe,
called Town-on-the-inside-of-blue-paint-point (Nexi ntaiataq !-an) ,
andwhile hunting about thisplace duringtheir long staytheydis
covered arocky cave oroverhangingclifffromwhich softblue stuff
continually dropped. Theyoungest said,&quot;Ihave discovered aval
uable thing which willbeused forpainting andforeverything carved.&quot;
After theyhadbeen there foralongtime theweather became fine
andtheseasmooth. Now inolden timespeople knew thateverything
wasdangerous. When thebrothers were about tostart, they said,
&quot;Wewilltakesome offnow tocarryhome.&quot; Sotheyknocked offa

Would itnotbebetter tothrow this bluepaintinto thewater ?

They were notdrowned; however, andreached shore insafety,so

Foralongtime after thebrothers reached shore with thisblue

After thepeoplehadworked awayforsome time, thetrench was

thewoman totellherpeopletohavepityonthemandnotdestroy all,

thewater flowed out,carrying numbers offrogs which scattered in

Then theycame withhim toFort-by-small-lake (Ak!uNu), just
west ofJuneau, and built abighouse forhimwith inside rooms
(t!aq!), corner andmiddleposts, thelastmentionedbeing carved to
represent theGreat Dipper (YAxte ).Atthat time theshaman
fasted forfourdaysandYAxte (theconstellation) appeared tohim.
Sofrom thathouse thepeople were called YAxte -hit-tan (Wain-
Housepeople).
Themountain-sheep tribegave thismanthename ofSkowadAl,and
hewas also called CAxtca/tc(Long-toothed-humpback). When his
spiritwasabout towork inhim,twoporcupine bladders wereblown
upandhunginthehouse, and,when thespirit arrived,allstoodupin
thecustomary way. Then heputonhismask and hissnowshoes,
which werethrown down onthefloor forhim,andcarried hisbowand
arrows inhishand. Although hecould notseethrough thismask, he
climbed uponthewalls oftheinside rooms andranaround there
backward. While there heshot atabladder andthearrow passed
straight throughit.

down before itandwascaught and killed. Then theothersquickly
speared thebearthrough andthrough andkilled it.
Meanwhile aspiritcame totheshaman, whohadremained athome,
saying,&quot;Your friend hasbeen killed byabear.&quot; They brought the

Some time afterward heagain began testinghisspirits, because
theywere going south towar, and,when theylefthim,hetold his
people thattheywould destroy anentire town.

When they tested himathespirit said,&quot;Allpeople onsticks,&quot; meaning
that itwanted alloftheir foestofallonsticks andbedestroyed when

alittle while afterward thefortpeople said,&quot;Where isthatmanwho

they rushed together onbothsides, and allthose inthefortwere
destroyed justastheshaman hadpredicted. Then theyreturned to
theirown fort,which wasalsoknown asEulachon-trap fort(Calnu).
Another time fivewomen went around theisland where theyhad
their fort, after mussels, andcame toareefontheouter side. They
lefttheir canoe untied and itfloated away. Then thetidebeganto

27.THEALSEK RIVER PEOPLE
Once therewasafamine among thepeopleofAlsek (Alse x)river.
There weretwoshamans there, oneofwhom began singingtobring
upeulachon, while theother sangforstrengthinorder toobtain
bears andother forest animals.
The firstshaman sspirittoldhimthat ifhewould godown the
littlerapids hewould seegreatnumbers ofeulachon. Sohedressed
upnextmorning andwent straight down under thewater inalittle
canoe.
That night theothershaman sspirits came tohim,saying thatthe
firstshaman would remain under water forfour nights; thathehad
goneintoahouse where were eulachon, salmon, andother fishand
hadthrown thedooropen.
Attheendoffourdaystheyhunted allaround andfound himlying
deadonthebeach amidpilesofeulachon. Assoon astheybrought
himup,alltheeulachon thatwere intheocean started torunup
river,andeveryonetried topreserveasmanyofthem ashecould.
Inthesame town weretwomenstruaiit women, andtheother
shaman toldthese thattherewould beagreatmany land otters about
thetown thatevening. Just ashehadsaid, atthetimewhen his
spirits came tohimthatevening, numbers ofland-otter-men came
through thevillage. They could beheardwhistling about thetown.
Finally some onesaid, &quot;Whyisitthat itsounds asiftheywere all
where thetwowomen are?&quot; Sureenough, theyfound thattheland
otters weretalking inside ofthetwowomen. Theones thatwere
inside ofthem werereally land-otter-men, thatis,menwhohadbeen
takenawaybytheland otters andmade likethemselves.
Aperson would oftencreepcloseuptothesewomen tofindout
what they were, butevery timesomething spoke outinside,&quot;Donot

These land-otter-men hadcome tothewomen toturnthem intoland-
otter-peoplealso.
Amenstruant woman istheonlything that willenfeeble thepower
ofashaman sspirit, therefore, although theshaman endeavored to
getthese land-otter-men outofthewomen, hisspirits kept turning
back. When theshaman sspiritcame tohimnextevening,itsaid
thatthereweremore land-otter-men comingtotakeaway theones in
thesewomen andthewomen withthem. Hetoldthepeopletobe
watchful, because there wasgoingtobeagreat disturbance that
night. When nightcameonthepeople were allverymuchfrightened
atthenoises theland-otter-men made under thehouses, andthey
hadgreat trouble keepingthetwowomen intheirrooms sothatthey
should notbecarried off. Allthepeople helped them, buttheland
otters were invisible. After thatnobody went outtocampfora
long time. Then they said tothetwowomen,&quot;Take yourbloody
clothes todifferent beaches, leave themthere, and telltheland
otters thattheyaretoogreat animals tofight withweakbeings.&quot;
Inthose times whenever amenstruant woman saidanythingofthat
kind ithadtobeobeyed. Sotheland otters went off.
Theshamans inthose times wereverystrict andstrong, andwhat
ever theysawwas true.Byandbythese shamans said,ltSome
thingisgoingtohappentothatgreattown therebythe lake.&quot; When
thethings thathadhappenedintheir neighbors townregardingthe
land otters were reportedtothepeople there, they said,&quot;Areyou
afraid ofthose things that stutter andcannottalk likeyouand I?&quot;
Byandbytwomen started hunting from thisplace. When they
hadreached thetopofaneighboring mountain, theylooked backand
sawagreatfloodcomedown between themountains andoverwhelm
their town. This floodwascaused byanavalanche which poured
intothelakeand filled itup,forcing thewater out.Somehuman
bodies were hangingtothebranches oftrees. Themenknew this
hadhappened onaccount ofthewaytheyhadspokenoftheland
otters, and, starting onaimlessly, theycame tothetown where the
shamans lived.
Oneofthesetwoshamans hadaquantityofoilwhich hewasgoing
tocarrytoanother town. Hewanted tobuyskins ofkinds different
from those hisownpeoplehad.When theyreached acamping place
outside ofthetown theman sspirittoldhimtogodown tothebeach

liked saltthings. There hesawavery bigdevilfish under arock,and
hisspiritsaid tohim,&quot;Look out,master, that isabiglive devilfish.&quot;
Assoon ashehadhookedit,hesawwhat appearedtobetwoducks
flying toward himfrom either side,buttheywere reallythedevilfish s

hesquatted down there under arock, while thedevilfish stentacles
sweptoverhim, carryingalltheforest trees along withthem. Two
daysafter thishisspirittoldhimtosetoutagain.
When thisshaman arrived atKlAkAnuwu,wheremany people lived,
everybody wanted toseehimandtryhisstrength, because theyhad
heard thathewasagreat shaman. Oneevening theybegan trying
him. They threw hismask onhisfaceand itstayed there, covering
uphiseyessothathecould notseewhere hewasgoing. Then,when
heranaround thefire,thepeoplestuck outtheir feettotriphim,but
hejumpedoverthem everytime. Thisshowed howstronghisspirits
were. Another time hisspirits came tohimthey built abigfireand
hestarted around it.Then hethrew the fireround upon everyone
whowasthereandashighupastheceiling, butthefirehurtnobody.
Byandbyhisclothes mansaid,&quot;Anotherspiritiscomingtohimsoon,
named Guts!caxot!qa.&quot;Thisspirit hadabigknife inhishand with
which hewould hitpeople onthebreast. When itcame tohim, the
shaman toldtheolderpeopletostandupstraight andmotionless and
nottofear, for ifonegotscared hewould die.Hehitone,andthey
laidhim inacertainplace. Then everyone said,&quot;You better kill
thatshaman,forhehasslain thebestman inthecompany.&quot; After
hisspirits hadgoneaway, however, theshaman went tothebody out
ofwhich blood was stillflowing andsaid,&quot;Itwillbeallright,&quot; while
hisspirits made anoise. Then theman gotupandjumped about.
Thepeoplelooked atthewoundedplace, buttherewasnotsomuch
asascaruponit.
After awhile theshaman began tradingoffhisgreasetoallwho
wanted it.Onedayhesaid, &quot;Somethingisabout tocomeupthat
willbeverydangeroustoyou people.&quot;Itwasthemoon. When the
moon cameupitshonebrightly, andthestarswere bright, butafter
atime themoon began tohide itsfacefrom them. Thatwaswhat
hehadpredicted. Thepeople, however, thoughtthiswascaused
bytheshaman himself.
Then theleading menandwomen oftheKagwAntan dressed them
selvesup,putgrease onthefire,andbegan dancingtodance themoon
out. After awhile itcame outjustalittle,sotheyfeltveryhappy
anddanced stillharder. They continued doingsountil thewhole
moon was out.Atthesame timepeople tookwhatever property
theyhad,held itupandcalled themoon for it.They saythemoon
actsinthiswaybecause itfeelspoorandlonely, so,when themoon
orsundoes thus, they actinthismanner. After thattheshaman
wenthome andtold hisfellow shaman howeveryone had triedhim
inthisplace.&quot;When Iwent around thefire,people putouttheir
feettomakemestumble. Theytriedmeinevery way.&quot;
Theshaman leftathome wasalsotryingtoexert hispower. His
spirits were singinginside ofhim inorder tobring salmon intothe

creeks;andhetoldsomeone tomakehimaone-barbed hook (dina ).
Whenever thesalmon hewasaftercame hewasgoing tousethisin
order togetit.When itcameupitfilled thewhole ofAlsek river
andbroke allthehooks ofthosewho tried tocatch it.Then the
shaman selected asmall boyandsaid,&quot;This littleboyisgoing to
hook it.&quot; Sohegavehimthehook hehadhadmade, andthe little
boypulleditupeasily. Theshaman sspirits had killed it.This
salmon wassolarge that allinthattownhadashare, andeventhen
itwasmore thanthey could cook foronemeal. Itwasthebiggest
salmon ever killed. There aretwocreeks inthatregion, andtothis
dayayoung boycaneasily pullinalarge spring salmon there such

There isaholenearbycalled Hole-Raven-bored(Yel-djuwAtu lia),
because Raven made itlong ago. Inearly times, whenever there
was tobealarge runofeulachon orotherfish, quantities ofrocks
came outofthat hole. Sopeople used togothere tolook atit.
Inoneplace Alsek river runsunder aglacier. People canpass
beneath intheir canoes, but,ifanyone speaks, while they areunder
it,theglacier comes down onthem. They saythat inthose times
thisglacier was likeananimal, andcould hearwhatwassaid toit.
So,when theycamped justbelowit,people wouldsay,uGive ussome
food.Wehaveneed offood.&quot; Then theglacier always camedown
with arushandraised awavewhich threw numbers ofsalmon ashore.
Thepeoplewere alsointhehabit ofgoing upsome distance above

there inabundance. The firsttime theywentupthey discovered
people whowere allnaked except about theloins, andtherewasa
shaman among themwhowasreputedtohave agreatdealofstrength.
Forthatreason theytriedhim. They tookmussel shells, clamshells,
andsharpstones and tried tocuthishair,butasinglehaironhis
headwas 3inchesacross,soeverythingbroke. Thisshaman had
many spirits. Some wereglacier spirits,called Sit!tukohani,Fair-
girls-of-the-glacier ;others were oftheskytribe called Gus! tu
kohani,Fair-girls-of-the-sky.
Theshaman saidthat,ontheirwaydown, onecanoe load ofthe
down-riverpeople would bedrowned astheypassed under theglacier ;
butthespiritsoftheshaman below toldhimabout this,andhewent

theidea ofmaking thegatevery strong, and ofhavingitfastened

Then thesurvivors begged Lucwa ktoletthem have thebodies of

evening, however, hehad allofthebodies thrownoutside, and
climbed onthetopbeam ofthefortwhere hewalked aboutwhistling
with happiness. Meanwhile hisopponents loaded their canoes with
thedeadandtookthem home. When theyburned these, theytook
allthewomen theyhadenslaved inprevious expeditions andthrew
them also into theflames. Then alltheEagle people assembled,
returned toEagle fort,burnedit,anddestroyed nearly everybody

One oftheir victims wasamannamed Slta/n, related totheAtha

means that thiswoman wasvery sorry indeed forthedeadpeople

When theAlsek Riverpeople heard ofthisslaughter theywere
very sad,but firstthey started theirrespective shamansfighting.
Itwasreallytheshamansspirits thatfought. Theshaman would

however, could seeeach otherplainly. Theywould alsogivethe

When thevisitor came infront ofthehouses hedidnotspeakto

because others were somuch afraid ofthevisitor.
Therichman talked from thecanoe forsuch alongtime thatthey
made alongnoise instead ofspeakingtohim, tolethimknow thathe

While theyweremoving along slowly skinning it,theysawthecolor

After theyhadtested allofhisspirits they started south towar.
They were always warring with thesouthernpeople. They andthe
southern people hated each other. When theywentdown with this
shaman theyalways enslaved manywomen andsometimesdestroyed
awhole town,allonaccount ofhisstrength.
There wasabravemanamongthesouthernpeople, called Qloga ,
who liked tokillpeople fromupthisway. Onetime alittlefcoy

bowandarrows with him. Thebraveman discovered where he
was,went after him,andpulled himoutfrom under thelogwhere
hewashiding. Butmeanwhile thespiritsinthecanoes ofthenorthern

The littleboyhadkilled him. Then allrantothelittleboyandtook

andwondered atwhat hehaddone. Theynamed himever after
Little-head (Qaca/k!u

head-killed(Xuga wadjaget). Evennow theyrelate how Little-
head killed thebrave man. Then thenorthern people came around
thefortanddestroyed everybody there, some ofthose inthecanoes
beingalso killed.
After that thesouthern peoplestarted north towar. They had
ashaman among them. Onthewaytheycame toamannamed
Murrelet (Tclit). When thismanwasyoung, hehadbeen trained
torunupsteepcliffsbyhaving amountain-sheepshoof tied

surprised and said,&quot;Now givehimsomemorethingstoputonhis

thismanwas hisbrother. Itisrather hard tosay.Then hesaid,
&quot;Iamgoingtocuttheropes now. Cryharder.&quot; Sohecut allof

Afterward, however, thewarriors found where theyhad drifted to

Then they started fortheforttoward which theyhadoriginally

Onehigh-caste woman theysaved andcarried south. They took

what brought themup.During thatjourney theshaman never ate.When theycame tothebeach hisfriends didnotknow atfirst
whohewas,buthismother related allthathadhappened. Then
hisfriends came inandbegan tohelphimshow hisspirits. Hewas
getting otherspirits from thecountryofthepeople hewasgoing

black spotsasthere weretowns heintended toconquer, and,while
allwere helping himwith hisspirits, thespots one after another
begantosmoke. Hisfather toldhim toremember theplace where
hehadstayed andnotdestroyit.So,when thespots burned, the
burning stoppedattheoneathiselbow which hesimply cleaned
away with hishand. Thismeant thathewouldextinguish the fire
atthatpoint andnotfight there.
Then allofhisfriendsprepared themselves and setouttowar.
Theycamestraight uptoacertain fortwithoutattemptingtohide,
andthefortpeople shouted,&quot;Comeon,youChilkatpeople.&quot; They
hadnoiron inthosedays, butwerearmed with mussel-shell knives
andspears, andworeround woodenfightinghats. They destroyed
allthemen atthisfortandenslaved thewomen andchildren. After
ward theystoodoppositethefort,took offtheirwarhatsandbegan
toscalpalltheyhad killed. When theygotofftheyputthescalps
onsticks andtiedthem allaround thecanoe. Theycalledthis,&quot;Shout

then, noteven Russians. Itwasveryclose tothetimewhenRaven
made us.Thepeople whoweredoing thesethings wereKagwAntan.
Theyhadstarted towarfromLucacak!i-anandKAqlAnuwu.
After that allthesouthern peoplestarted north tomake war,
coming bytheoutsidepassage. The firstplace theyreached while
roundingthisisland wasMurrelet-pointfort(Aoli-tcIltinu).Onecanoe
started offtospyuponthem andwaschased ashore butwascarried
across anarrowstripoflandandsogotback. Therefore thisplace
iscalledThings-taken-over (AnAxgAiiia )-Then theycame right
uptothefort,destroyed it,andcapturedthewomen. There must
have been ahundred canoes comingtowar. Inthose days they
always usedbowsandarrows.
Acertain woman captured here said,&quot;There isanother townup

thetidewasprettywellup,passed throughaplace where there is

woods. Inthemorning they descended tofight, andthewomen
andchildren began crying. They capturedall.Meanwhile thetidal
rapids began,toroar asthetide fell.
Onewoman amongthecaptives wasveryold.They asked her
what time oftide toruntherapids, andshesaid toherself,&quot;It is

Itisjustaswell todieastobeenslaved.&quot; Soshesaid tothem,

andwere seennomore. The oldwoman wasdrowned with then*.
Sotheymade amark with their blood attheplace where these two

Nextdaytheremaining canoes started outwhen thetidewashigh
andcame toanother fortnext morning. While theywerearound
behind thisawoman came out.Then theyseized herandrana
spearupintoherbody frombeneath manytimes until shedropped
dead without speaking. Sothisfortcame tobecalled, Fort-where-
they-stabbed-up-into-a- woman s-privates (KAk !-kagus-wudu watAqi-

allinthefortweredestroyed, andstarted ontoanother. When they
made anattack inthosedays, theynever approachedintheday
time buttoward morning when everybody was sleeping soundly.
Both sidesusedwooden helmets andspears.
Atthis fortthewomen werealways diggingabigvarietyofclam
(called gaLl), storingthese clams inthefortforfood. The fortwas
filled with them. So,when theassailants started upthecliff,one
ofthemen inside struck himwith aclam shelljustunder thewar
hatsothathebledprofusely. Hecould notseeonaccount ofthe
blood. Then theman intheforttookanIndian axandbeat out
hisbrains. Afterward allinthefortseized clam shells andstruck
their foes inthefacewiththem sothatthey could notcome up.
They threw sofastthat thecanoes were allkeptaway ;sothat
placeisnow called Where-clams-kept-out-the-foes (Xacsixani-gaiJ).
Forthesame reason thiswastheonlyfortwhere anypeople were
saved, andontheotherhandmanyoftheenemy were destroyed by
thefortpeople.
Now theyleftthis fortandcame toanother, landing onabeach
nearby,andbetween them andthefortwaswhat theysupposedto

poise-belly (Tcitciu k!).
Thewarriors thought theyweregetting much thebest ofthepeople
upthisway,butreally onlyafewwere lefttolook after theforts,
most beingcollected elsewhere.
After theyhaddestroyedallthepeopleinfour fortstheylanded
onalongsandy beach tocut offthescalps. When there wasno
time toscalp,theheads were carried awayuntil there should bemore
leisure. Scalps andslaves werewhatpeople fought for,andthey
dried thescalps byrubbing themonhotstones orholding them near
the fire.Then they again started north. This raidconsumed the
whole summer.
Southward ofHuna wasafortonahigh cliff, called Jealous-man
fort(Caositl yiqa-mrwu ).Itwasnamed fromthemanwhoencamped

Thenext fortthey attacked iscalled Huna-peoplesfort(Huna-

people andstarted south. Atthistimetheywereoverloaded with the
slaves theyhadtaken, buttheywent intoeveryforttheypassed near

called Fort- that-rapids-run-around (Datx-xatkAnAda -nu).When

Most ofthenorthern people, however, wereencamped alongthe

came fromYakutat, Alsek river, andother placestoLuca/cak!i-an.
They talked togetherforalongtimeandfinally decided uponaplan.

theycutthetreeintwoandtook asection offalong thewhole length

Inolden times only high-caste people knew thestoryofRaven

these twooldmen,andyethehadadaughter, athing noone isable
toexplain. Nordopeople know what thisdaughter was. Thetwo
oldpersons took care ofherlikeservants, andespecially theyalways
looked into thewater before shedrank toseethat itwasperfectly
clean.
First ofallbeings Nas-cAki-yel created theHeron (LAq!)asavery

verygoodandvery wiseman atthat time.
Raven came intobeinginthiswise. His firstmother hadmany
children, buttheyalldiedyoung, andshecried overthemcontinually.
Accordingtosome, thiswoman wasNas-cA ki-yeTssister and itwas
Nas-cAki-yeJwhowasdoingthisbecause hedidnotwishhertohave
anymale children. ByandbyHeron came toherandsaid,&quot;What

Heron andRaven bothbecame servants toNas-cAki-yel, buthe

Some timeafterward aman died,andRaven, comingintothehouse,
sawhimthere with hiswifeandchildren weeping around him. Sohe
raised thedeadman sblanket withbothhands, held itoverthebody,
andbrought himback tolife.
&amp;gt;
After thatbothRaven andherhusband told thiswoman thatthere
wasnodeath, butshedisbelieved them. ThenRaven said toher,
&quot;Liedown andgotosleep.&quot; And, assheslept, shethought shesaw
awide trailwithmany people uponitand allkinds offierce animals
around. Good people had topass alongthis trail inorder tolive
again. When shecame totheendofthetrail therewasagreat river
there, andacanoe came across toherfrom theother sideofit.She
entered thisandcrossed. There some people came toherandsaid,
&quot;You better goback.Wearenotinagood place. There isstarva
tionhere,wearecold,andwegetnowater todrink.&quot;
This iswhypeople burn thebodies ofthedeadandputfood intothe
fireforthem toeat.Burningtheirbodies makes thedeadcomfortable.
Iftheywerenotburned theirspirits would becold. This iswhythey
invite allthose oftheoppositeclan aswell asthenearest rela
tions ofthedeadman swife, seating them togetherinoneplace, and
burn food infront ofthem. Itisbecause they think thatthedead
person getsalloftheproperty destroyed atthefeastand allofthe
foodthenburned up.Itisonaccount ofwhatRaven showed them
thattheydoso.
Because Nas-cAki-yel gotitintohismind towish fordaylight inthe
world, hehadwished foragrandchild through whom itmight come.
Now, therefore, although heknew what answer hewouldreceive, he
sent forLiuwAt-uwadji gi-can andquestioned himtoseewhether he
would answer right:&quot;Where didthischildcomefrom ?Whose isit?
Canyoutell?&quot; And theother said,&quot;His eyeslook liketheeyesof
Raven.&quot; That ishowhecame togetthename Raven.
After awhile thebaby began tocrawl about. Hisgrandfather
thought agreat deal ofhimand lethimplaywitheverythinginthe
house. Everythinginthehouse was his.TheRaven began crying
forthemoon, untilfinally theyhanded ittohimandquickasawink
heletitgoupintothesky. After hehadobtained everything else,
hebegantocryfortheboxinwhich daylight wasstored. Hecried,
cried, cried foravery long time, until helooked asthough hewere
getting very sick,andfinallyhisgrandfather said, &quot;Bring mychild
here.&quot; Sotheyhanded Raven tohisgrandfather. Then hisgrand
father said tohim, &quot;My grandchild, Iamgiving youthelastthingI
have inthe world.&quot; Sohegaveittohim.
Then Raven, whowasalready quite large, walked down along the
bank ofNass river until heheard thenoise people weremaking as
they fished along theshore foreulachon inthedarkness. Allthepeo
pleintheworld then lived atoneplaceatthemouth oftheNass.

Theyhadalready heard thatNas-cAki-yel hadsomething called&quot;day
light/ which would somedaycome intotheworld, andtheyused to
talkabout itagreat deal. They were afraid ofit.
ThenRaven shouted tothefishermen,&quot;Why doyoumake somuch
noise? Ifyoumake somuch noise Iwillbreakdaylight onyou.&quot;
Eight canoe loads ofpeople werefishing there. Buttheyanswered,
&quot;You arenotNas-cAki-yel. Howcanyouhave thedaylight?&quot;, and
thenoise continued. ThenRaven opened theboxalittleandlight
shotovertheworld likelightning. Atthattheymade stillmore noise.
Soheopened theboxcompletely andtherewasdaylight everywhere.
When thisdaylight burst upon thepeople theywere verymuch
frightened, andsome ranintothewater, some intothewoods. Those
thathadhair-seal orfur-seal skins forclothing ranintothewater and
became hair sealsandfurseals. Hair sealandfursealwereformerly
onlythenames oftheclothing they had.&quot;Those whohad skins
called marten skins, black-bear skins, grizzly-bear skins, etc.,ran
^intothewoods andturned intosuch animals.
Petrel (GAnu k)wasoneofthefirstpersons created byNas-cAki-yel.
Hewaskeeperofthefresh water, andwould letnone elsetouch it.
Thespring heowned wasonarocky island outside ofKuiu, called
Deki-nu (Fort-far-out), where thewellmaystillbeseen. Raven
stole agreat mouthful ofthiswater anddroppedithereandthere
ashewentalong. This istheoriginofthegreatrivers oftheworld,
theNass, Skeena, Stikine, Chilkat, andothers. Hesaid, Thisthing
that Idrophereandthere willwhirl allthetime. Itwillnotoverflow
theworld, yetthere willbeplentyof water.&quot; Before thistime
Raven issaidtohavebeenpure white, but,ashewasflying upthrough
thesmoke holewith Petrel swater, thelatter said, &quot;Spirits, hold
downmysmoke hole.&quot; Sothey heldhim until hewasturned black
bythesmoke.
After thisRaven sawafirefaroutatsea. Tyingapieceofpitch-
wood toachicken hawk sbill,hetoldhimtogoouttothisfire,touch
itwith thepitchwood, andbringitback. When hehadbroughtitto
himRaven putitintotherockandtheredcedar saying,&quot;This is
howyou aretogetyour fire,from thisrockand thisredcedar,&quot;
andthat isthewaytheyformerlydid.
ThusRaven (Yel)went aboutamongthenatives ofAlaskatelling
themwhat todo,but*Nas-cAki-yeJ theynever saw. Raven showed
alltheTlingit what todoforaliving, buthedidnotgettobesuch
ahighpersonasNas-cAki-yel, andhetaughtthepeople much fool
ishness. Atthattime theworld was fullofdangerousanimals and
fish. Raven also tiedupsome witches, andsoitwasthrough him
that thepeoplebelieved inwitchcraft. Then hetold thepeople
thatsome wild animals were tobetheir friends (i.e.,their crest
animals) towhich theywere totalk.

Once hegave afeast andinvited personstoitfrom (ttherplaces.
Hehadtwo slaves after that,named GidzagetandGidzanuqlu.
This iswhy thenatives herehad slaves. Itwasonaccount ofhis
example. There wasamanwhohadnoarm, soRaven thought he
would beashaman andcurehim. This ishowtheTlingit came to
haveshamans. After therewasdeath heshowed themhow todance
over thebody placedinthemiddle ofthefloor.
Raven alsotaughtthepeople how tomake halibut hooks, and
went out fishing: with them. Hehadnames forthehalibut hookso
andtalked tothem before heletthemdown intothesea. That is
why thenatives dosonow. Healsotaught them tobeveryquick
when theywent outhalibutfishingortheywould catchnothing.
Healsomade different kinds offishtraps andtaughtthepeople
how tousethem. Hemade thesmall variety andabigtrap,shaped
likeabarrel, foruseintheStikine.
Hetaught themhow tomake thesealspear (kAt). Ithasmany
barbs, andthere aredifferent kinds. One iscalled tsa-cAxlctdza s.
Itisprovided withsome attachment that hitstheseal.(tsa)upon
theheadwhenever itcomes tothesurface, drivingitshead under
water until itdies,andthat iswhat thenamesignifies.
Then heshowed themhow tomake acanoe. Thishedidonthe
Queen Charlotte islands. At first thepeople were afraid toget
intoit,buthesaid,&quot;The canoe isnotdangerous. Peoplewillseldom
getdrowned.&quot;
Hetaught themhow tocatch asalmon calledIcqe n,which requires
adifferent kind ofhookfrom thatused forhalibut. Theplacewhere
hetaught people how togetdifferent kinds ofshellfish isabeach
ontheQueen Charlotte islands called Raven sbeach tothisday.
After hewasthrough teachingthepeoplethesethings, hewent
under theocean, andwhen hecame back, taught them that thesea
animals arenotwhatwethink they are,butarelikehumanbeings.
First hewent tothehalibutpeople. They have achiefwhoinvited
him toeat,andhaddried devilfish andother kinds ofdried fish
broughtout.Hewaswell liked everywhere hewent under thesea
because hewasaverysmart man. After thathewent toseethe
sculpin people, whowereveryindustrious andhad allkinds ofthings
intheir houses. Thekiller-whale people seemed toliveonhair-seal
meat, fat,and oil. Their head chiefwasnamed GonaqAde t,and
even tothisdaythenatives saythat thesightofhimbrings good
fortune.
While hewasunder theocean hesaw,some people fishingforhali
but,andhetried toteasethembytaking hold oftheir bait. They,
however, caught himbythe billandpulled himupasfarasthe
bottom oftheir canoe, where hebraced himself sothatthey pulled
his billout.They didnotknow what this billwasand called it

gonet-luwu (bill-of-something-unknown). Then Raven went
fromhouse tohouseinquiringforhisbilluntil hecame tothehouse
ofthechief. Upon askingforitthere, theyhanded ittohimwrapped
ineagledown. Then heputitback into itsplaceandflew offthrough
thesmoke hole.
Raven leftthattownandcame toanother. There hesawaking
salmon jumping about faroutatsea.Hegotitashore and killed
it.Because hewasable todoeverything, thenatives did allthat
hetoldthem. Hewastheonewhotaughtallthingstothenatives,
andsome ofthem stillfollow histeachings. After thathegotall
kinds ofbirds forhisservants. Itwasthrough these thatpeople
found outhewastheRaven.
\Oncehewent toacertainplaceandtoldthepeopletogoandfight
others. Hesaid,&quot;You gothereand killthemall,andyouwillhave
allthethingsinthat town.&quot; Thiswasthebeginningofwar.
After having beendown among the fishteaching them, Raven
wentamongthebirds andland animals. Hesaid tothegrouse
(nukt),&quot;You aretoliveinaplace where itiswintry, andyouwill
always lookoutforaplace highupsothatyoucangetplentyof

toswallow them sothattheymight become hisstrength.&quot;You
willneverstarve,&quot; hesaid,&quot;solongasyouhave these fourpebbles.&quot;
Healsosaid,&quot;You know that Sealion isyour grandchild. You
must begenerous, getfourmore pebbles andgivethem to him.&quot;
That ishowthesealion came tohave fourlarge pebbles.Itthrows
these athunters, and,ifonestrikes aperson,itkillshim. From
thisstoryitisknown thatthegrouse andthesealion canunderstand
each other.
Raven said totheptarmigan:&quot;You willbethemaker ofsnow-
shoes. You willknowhow totravel insnow.&quot; Itwasfrom these
birds that theAthapascans learned how tomake snowshoes, and it
wasfromthem thatthey learned how toputtheirlacingson.
NextRaven came tothe &quot;wildcanary&quot; (s!as!), which isfound in
theTlingit countryalltheyearround, and said: &quot;You willbehead
among thevery small birds. You arenottoliveonwhathuman
beingseat.Keepaway from them.&quot;
Then hewent totherobin andsaid: &quot;You willmake thepeople
happy byletting them hear yourwhistle. You willbeagood

Toavery small bird called kot!ai,about thesizeofabutterfly,

ThenRaven came tothebluejayandsaid: &quot;You willhave very

Then hesaid totheland otter: &quot;You willliveinthewaterjustas
well ason land.&quot; Heandtheland otter weregood friends,sothey
went halibutfishing together. Theland otterwasafinefisherman.
Finally hesaid totheland otter: &quot;You willalways haveyourhouse

Raventellingthis totheland otter. AllAlaskans know about the
land-otter-man butveryfew tellthestoryofRavencorrectly.
Ifthefriends ofthosewhohavebeentakenawaybytheland otters
getthem back, theybecome shamans, therefore itwasthrough the
land otters thatshamans were firstknown. Shamans canseeone

The firstman captured (or&quot;
saved&quot;) bytheland otters wasa
KiksA dinamed KAka .Theland otters keptcoming tohiminlarge
canoes lookinglikehismother orhissister orother dearrelation, and
pretendingthattfieyhadbeen lookingforhim foralong time. But
theycould notcontrol themselves aswell ashe,andatsuch times he
would discover whotheywereandthat theircanoe wasnothing but
askate. Finally, whenKAka found thathecould notseehisfriends,
hethought thathemightaswellgivehimself uptotheland otters.
Then theynamed himQowulka ,aword intheland-otter language
nowappliedtoakind offishhook which thehalibut arethoughtto
likebetter than allothers. Nowadays, when afigureofQowulka
ismade,itiscovered with adogskin, because itwasbymeans ofa
dogskinthathefrightened thelandotters, andtheyalsohanghis
apron about withdogbones. Theshaman who ispossessed byhim
dresses inthesame manner. FromKAka thepeoplelearned that
theland otters affect theminds ofthosewhohave been withthem
foralongtime soastoturnthem againsttheirown friends. They
alsolearned fromhimthat there areshamans among theland otters,
andthattheland otters have alanguageoftheirown.
FortwoyearsKAka/;sfriends hunted forhim, fastingatthesame
timeandremaining awayfrom their wives. Attheendofthisperiod
theland otters went toanisland about 50miles from Sitka andtook
KAka withthem. Theland-otter tribe goestothisplace every year.
Then anoldland-otter-woman called *toKAka :&quot;Mynephew,Isee
thatyouareworrying about thepeopleatyourhome. When you
gettotheplace whither wearegoing place yourselfastride ofthefirst
logyouseelying onthebeach and sitthere aslong asyoucan.&quot;
Andherhusband said tohim:&quot;Keep yourhead covered over. Do
notlook around.&quot; They gavehim this direction because they
thought,&quot;Ifthishuman beingsees allofourways andlearns allof
ourhabits, weshall die.&quot; Onthewayacross theland-otter-people
sangasong, reallyakind ofprayer,ofwhich thewords are, &quot;May

Themoment theycame toland theland-otter-people disappeared
andhedidnotknow what hadbecome ofthem. Theymayhave

because hedidnotbelieve thatland otters arestronger thanhuman

After thepeople hadbrought KAka7toaplace justaround thepoint

most ofhisrelations remained with him, while twowenthome to

After leavingtheland otters Raven appearedatTaku. There is
acliffatthemouth ofthat inlet called WAs!As!e where theNorth
Wind used tolive,andRaven stayedthere with him. TheNorth
Wind wasveryproud andshone allover withwhat theIndians
thought were icicles. SotheIndians never sayanything against the
North Wind, however longitblows, because ithasspirits (i.e.,power).
Years agopeople thought thatthere werespiritsinallthelargecliffs
upontheislands, andtheywould praytothose cliffs.- They had
thisfeeling toward them because Raven once lived inthis cliffwith
theNorth Wind.
Raven observed certainregulations very strictly when hewas
amongtherivers hehadcreated. Hetoldpeople never tomention
anythingthat lives intheseabyitsrightname while theywere there,
buttocallasealarabbit, forinstance, andsowith theother animals.
Thiswas tokeepthem from meeting with misfortune amongthe
rapids. FormerlytheIndians were verystrict with their children
when theywentuptherivers, butnowadaysallthathasbeen for
gotten.
~Sfter thisRaven wrenttoChilkat andentered asweat house along
withthechief ofthekiller whales who tried toroast him. Raven, how

ItwasfromRaven thatpeople found outthere areAthapascan
Indians. Hewentback into their country. SotheChilkat people
tothisdaymake theirmoney bygoingthither. Healsoshowed the
Chilkat people how tomaketcil,secret storehouses maintained some

Raven alsoshowed theChilkat peoplethefirstseeds oftheIndian

There hefound achiefnamed Aya yi,whohadmarried thedaughter

Hiswifewasalways making baskets, whileAya/yi himself went out

After herhusband hadfound herweepingseveral times heasked,
&quot;What areyoualways cryingabout?&quot; andshesaid,&quot;Iamgetting

Then hepaddled home.
Even before shestarted across,hiswifenoticed that therewasa
heavy fogoverherfather svillage, andwhen shegotthere shefound
itvacant. There wasnothinginitbutdead bodies, andshewent
from house tohouse weeping. Now after herchildren hadthought
over thismatter forawhile, they skinned some ofthebodies and
made acanoe outofthem. Itwasthe first oftheskin canoes. It
was allonaccount ofAyayihaving murdered thepeopleofthat
town. Theytiedthoseplaces onthecanoe thathad tobemade
tight, withhuman hair. Afterward theytook itdown tothewater
andputitin,making akind ofsingingnoise astheywent. Nowadays
these canoes aremade ofallkinds ofskins, butthehairused isalways

intothewater. Theyalsomade adrum outofhuman skin.
After that allgotintothecanoe, andtheystarted fortheir father s

After theyhadreached theirownvillage Raven said totheeldest

ThenRaven came toalarge town where everyone appearedto
have died. Heentered thelargest house, andsawnooneinside,
yethecould feelaperson continually pushing against him. Itwas
aghost house, and thetown was called theTown ofGhosts

ThenRaven stayed withTsAmaya, andtheybecame good friends
also. The latter lived allbyhimself atthattime,allofhisfriends

Afterward Raven came towhere ahouse wasfloatingfaroutat

themonster sdaughter. Then hegotinto acanoe, paddled out
near thehouse, andspearedit.Inside heheard allkinds ofsongs
sungbydifferent voices. These were thesongs people were tosing
inthefishingseason. When Raven threw hisspear,itbecame very

fast.While themanandhiswifewereaway fishing anddigging clams
thepuppies played about thehouse, andthenoise theymade sound
edjustlikethat ofchildren. Butthefemale always watched atthe
door, andwhen theirmother ranuptostopthem allwould belying
about onthefloor asleep. They kept gettingnoisier andnoisier,
andsounded moreandmore likehumanbeings. Finally LAkitcine
heard itandsaid tohiswife :Who arethesemakingsomuch noise
here?&quot; &quot;It isthosedogs.&quot; Then shethought very seriously what
sheshould dowith thepuppies. Thenexttime LAkitcine wasout
heheard them stillmoreplainly, andnowhethought thatheheard

&quot;It isnotthose dogsthat Iheartalking.&quot; Hewas sodangerous
aman that hiswifewasverymuchfrightened.
After that sheformed aplan. So,when herhusband went out
halibut fishing thenext time, shestuck herdigging stick intothe
ground, putherblanket aroundit,andherhatupon theend. Then
sheranupthrough thewoods andhidherself, while the littledogwas
watching LAkitcine .After thatshecreptback tothehouse, which
wasmade ofbrush, andinwhich theywere againmakingagreat deal

about inhuman forms, theirdogskinslyingashort distance away

must liketobedogssinceyouweardog skins,&quot; grabbed theskinsand
threw them intothe fire. The little dogthat satoutside wasthe
onlyonethatremained initsoriginal form.
Now,when LAkitcine came ashore, andsawthechildren, hewas
angry and feltverymuch ashamed athaving been outwitted. He
didnotknowhow tokillthem, forhethought theyhadmorepower
than he.One,named KAckULk!,wasashaman. Hehadhisgrand
father andtheone-eyed manand hiswifethat hisgrandfather had

with hiswife, and,when hecame intothehouse, hebegan tothrow
andkickthings about. But,when hebegan tobeat hiswife, the
children jumped uponhimandfought with him. Theyalsoasked
thedogtohelpthem. Together theykilled him.

Raven went toanother place andturned himself intoawoman.
Then shethoughtwithin herself,&quot;Whose daughtershall IsayIam?&quot;
Shesawaseagull sitting outonahighrockandthought shewould
callthatherfather. Years agoachiefwould always pickoutahigh
placeinthevillage onwhich tositinthemorning, andwhenRaven
sawtheseagullshethoughtwithin herself/ IamTAcAkltuA ns(Sitter-
on-a-high-clifFs) daughter.&quot; Acanoe came alongfilled with killer
whales returningtotheirownvillage, andshemarried oneofthem.
When theygotnear thetown, some oneonthebeach called tothem,
&quot;Where isthatcanoe comingfrom?&quot; andonereplied,&quot;We have
a&quot;AsTsAgwa/n wasamischiefmailerandfollowed Raven totellwhat hehaddone tohiswife, so
someman willalways follow oneupifhedoesn ttellthetruth. Formerly, when aman lefthiswife, a
settlement ofproperty wasmade and,ifamanmarried again before thistook place, hisfirstwifemade
trouble forhissecond. Sincenoonewants trouble ofthiskind, awoman always found outwhat aman
was likebefore shemarried him, justasthiswoman found outabout Raven.
&quot;Since DAmna/dji married awoman ofhigher family than himself andwa.staunted bythetown
people, nowadays they tellayoungman that, ifhemarries agirlofhigher rankthan himself, they will
notremain together long,because shewill feelabove himandwanthimtoplease hercontinually, while
shedoesnothing toplease him. AsDAmna/dji from being poorbecame richsuddenly andwasvery
hardonhispeopletillallofhisriches were again takenaway from him,they say,When you.become
wealthy afterhaving been poor, don tbeproud oryourmoney will allleave you.When amanhas
hadplentyofmoneyallhis lifeandwastes itfoolishly, theysayofhim,Hehasfallen from thehands
ofthebrant Soayoungmannowadays savesupaconsiderable sum ofmoney before hemarries that
hemaynotbemade fun of.Perhapsifwehadnothadthisstoryamong thenatives ofAlaska we
would havehadnothing togoby.
&quot;The factthatDAmna djiswife srelations didnotinsult ormaltreat himafter they learned ho\v
poorhewas,shows thattheywere really high caste. Hadtheybutrecently acquired theirwealth they
would havedone so.Therefore people saytoaperson whospeaks before hethinks, Why can tyoii
belikeDAmnadjisbrothers-in-law? Think before youspeak. When thevillage people weremaking
funoftheir brother-in-law, hiswife srelations might havedoneanything tothem, fortheyhadwealth
infursandslaves, buttheykept quiet because theyhadtoomuch respect fortheir sister todisgrace
herhusband svillage people. Itwasalsooutofrespect fortheir sister that,when theyfound outthat
allthatthepoormanhadforthem todrinkwaswater, theydrank itwillingly without saying aword,
where alow-caste person would have grumbled. Therefore people tellamanwhohasnorespect for
hisbrother-in-law because heislow-caste thatheought tobelikethese brothers-in-law ofDAmna/dji.
Because DAmna djiwaslucky twice, thepeople inolden times used topray forluck continually. If

that?&quot; they inquired, because inolden timespeople never went for
anywoman bycanoeexcept thedaughterofachief. &quot;It isTACAkl-
ttUVsdaughter,&quot;saidthey.&quot;ItisCuda xduxo&quot;s (Barked-hemlock s)
daughter.&quot;Allofthekiller whales believed this.
Afterthat, thekiller whales begantonotice that theirfoodwas
disappearing very rapidly, although theywerealways outfishing and
hunting andhadhadtheirhousepiledfullofboxes ofgrease. They
said,&quot;What iswrong? What hasbecome ofallthegrease andfat
inthese boxes?&quot; They could notfindoutforalong time. Raven
wore alabret atthattime setwithabalone shellwhich wasformerly
very valuable, and itisfromhim thathigh-caste people afterward
used these. After some time theyfound thislabret inone ofthe
boxes ofgrease andsaid,&quot;Just look atthislabret in here.&quot; Then
Raven exclaimed,&quot;Ih!mylabret, that isalways thewaywithmy
labret. Whenever itfeels likedoing so,itwillleavemy lipand
gooffanywhere.&quot;
ByandbyRavensaid,lIwonder what iswrong that Ihavesuchbad
dreams. Idreamt that allthepeopleofthisvillage wereasleep, and
myhusband went tosleepandnever wokeup.Mydreams always
come true. Whatever Idreamsurely happens.&quot; Late thenext
night shegotastick, sharpened theends,andkilled herhusband; and
earlyinthemorning theyheard hercrying, &quot;Myhusband, CawA t-
kaLAqdagesfather.&quot; Yearsago,before thewhite lawscame in
force,when achief used these words inhisspeech, people knew that
hehadagrudge against some oneandwasgoingtomurder him. The
killer whales, however, didnotknowwhat shemeant.
ThenRaven toldthepeople thatherhusband hadsaid,&quot;Take me
andplacemequiteadistance from the town.&quot; They didso,andshe
said, &quot;When youhearmecry,Idon twantanyofyoutopass the
place where Iammourning. Tieupthefingersofmyright hand.
Allow metoeatwithmylefthandonly. You people must also
waitupon me.Youmust bringmeeverythingIeat. Alsopaintmy
face black.&quot; Shebeing thewidow, theyhadtodoeverything justasshe
toldthem, andthese aretheregulations people haveobserved uptothe
present time. When theyheard hercrying around thespotwhere
herhusband sbodyhadbeen laid,noonedared gonear,andtothis
daythosewhogobyahouse where peoplearemourning have tobe
very quiet. Nordothey passitatallunless theyarecompelledto.
Raven stayed there mourningforalong time, butshewasreally
eatingthekiller-whale sbody. After shehadremained byitfora
very long time, shewould comehome chewing gum, but,when the
husband srelations asked herforapiece, shewould say, &quot;No,no
onecanchew thisgumbutMaca
,&quot;which wasthename shegaveto
herself.

Shelived there foralongtime, continually crying outofdoors, but
shewasreally cryingforjoybecause sheintended tokillallofthekiller
whales.
While sitting outside onedayakek!u(asmall seagullwithblack
headandwhite body)flewpast,andRaven said,&quot;Here comes theman
Imade white.&quot; Byandbyshesawanother, called kuLleta,also
white, andrepeatedthesame words. Thensome swans came along
farupinthesky,andshesaid thesame thing about them. The
killer whales heard allthisand said,&quot;Since youhavemade them
white, can tyoumake uswhite also?&quot; &quot;Itwillhurtyoutobemade
white,&quot;saidRaven.&quot;Those peoplethatcame along weremade
white because theywere brave.&quot; Then shesharpenedthesame hard
wood stick withwhich shehadkilled herhusband andtold allofthe
killers tolieinarow. Shebegan poundingthisintotheirears,andso
killed allofthembutthelast. Thislooked upintime toseewhat she
wasdoing andrushed intotheseasaying,&quot;Raven hasfinished us
sureenough&quot; (QothagAsiniyel). Raven remained there forsome
time eatingthewhales shehad killed.
Thereason whythere aresomany cowards among mennowadays
isbecause Raven, beingaman,made himself intoawoman atthat
time. Thepeoplethat livesinglealltheir lives aresuch ascamefrom
Raven atthatperiod.This isalsowhythieves aregreattalkers and,
when theyhavegotteninto trouble, have awayofgetting out,and
whysomewomen arebadanddeceive theirhusbands; forRaven said
that hishusband hadwanted tobeburied alongwayfrom town, and
theybelieved him. This iswhytheTlingit used tobeverycareful of
waytheyspoke andeven ofthewaytheywalked when inpublic.a
After thatRaven came toafishhawk (kimackAnye t)andexclaim
ing,&quot;Oh!myfriend.&quot; entered itshouse, where wasagreat quantity
offood. Hefeltveryhappyatthesight, andsaid tothebird,&quot;I
willstaywithyouall winter.&quot; Then hestayedsolong that the
hawk begantogettired ofhim, because Raven would notwork.
When hesawthat thebirdwasgetting wearyofhimhewouldsay,
&quot;The time formetowork hasn tcomeyet.When Iworkyouwill
have plentyofrest.You willnothave todoathing. Thisbeach
aThispart ofthestorywasreferred towhen onewished toimply thataperson wastrying tomake
people believe thathewasbetter thanhereally was. Sonowadays, when ahigh-caste manwants to
marry anorphan, people findoutwhoherfather is,because Raven made believe herownfather wasa
chief. Somewomen willgoofftoastrange placeandsayfalsely, Iamso-and-so sdaughter/ making
people think that shebelongs toaveryhigh family. Thesame sort ofwoman willassume mourning
forherhusband, andmake people believe sheismourning when sheisreally thinking what sheisgoing
todoandwhere sheisgoing. Ifshefindsoutshecangetherliving falsely, shewillkeeponbeing false.
That iswhyRaven told somany stories about herhusband sdeath. When amother seesthather
girlisvery foolish, shewillsaytoher,When youmarry andbecome awidow, you willeatupyour
husband sbody, meaning that,ifherhusband leaves heranyproperty, shewilluse itupfoolishly.
Shealsosays toher,Youaresofoolish now, Ibelieve you willsteal afteryouaremarried, meaning
thatshewillbefoolish withwhat herhusband earns. Then, shesays, They willfindyououtbyfind
ingsomething ofyours intheplacewhere youhave been,and itwillbeadisgracetoyour brothers and
your father.&quot;(From thewriter sinformant.)

ingthem.&quot; Sothehawk would think ofwhatRaven wasgoingtodo
forhim, forget everything else,andwork alltheharder tosupplyhimwith food whileRavenstayedinthehouse. Raven would also
talk tohim, saying,&quot;Iremember tohave seenyoulong ago.You
were very high-caste.Iremember itverywell.&quot; Inthatwayhe
made thehawkforgetforatime allthebadfeelings hehadhad
toward him. Butfinallythe littlehawk determined togoaway, and
heleftRaven there alone.a
ThenRaven went toanother industrious bird, calledhinyikle xi,
afishingbirdliving along theriver. Hecalledhimli
brother-in-law/
andwasinvited tohavesomethingtoeat,butnextmorning thebird
lefthim forheknew thathewasalazyfellow.6
After thatRaven came tothegoose people, andmarried awoman
among them. Byandbytheysaid tohim,&quot;We aregoingtoleave
forother countries. Idon tthinkyoucanstand thejourney.&quot; Oh !
yes,&quot;saidRaven,&quot;Ithink Icanstand thejourney.Ifyoucan,I
can.&quot; Sotheysetout,and,whenRaven becametired, hiswife flew
along under him toholdhimup. Finally theycame tocamp and
began going outonthebeaches todigroots. Raven helped them,
buthedidnotlikethegooselifenorthefoodthey ate,sohecom
menced togetverylean. Onedayhekilled agoose andbegan cook

Raven went toanotherplace, andtheysaid tohim,&quot;There will
soonbeagreatfeasthere,&quot; andthey asked him tomake atotem
pole. Hefinishedit,and,when theyputitup,theyhadabigdance.
Thepeople whogavethiswere oftheWolf clan,sohedanced with
oneofthetwoRavenparties. Afterward hemade along speech
tothehost. Then theydanced again, andRaven held aspearin
hishands. Thismeant thathewasgoingtoinvite toafeast next,
andwasdone that theymight givehimmore than theothers. So
nowadays some areinearnest indoingthiswhile others gothrough
theperformance andleave without keepingitinmind. Raven was
theperson who firsthadthose dances andspeeches.
aThis isthewaynowadays withpersons whohavenorespect forthemselves. They gofromhouse
tohouse tobefedbyothers, andsuchpersons aregreedy, great eaters, andlazy. Thepeopletelltheir
children thatthosewholead thiskind oflifearenotrespected. Aperson who tellsthetruth isalways
known because hekeepshisword. When Katishan wasaboy,theyused tosaytohimwhen they

While theywereengagedinthelastdance theopposite company
ofRavens danced veryhardandshowedfightbycrossingtheline
which isalwayssetbetween. Forthisreason Raven would notgoto
thenext feast, tobeconfronted bythesepeople. Theysent after
himmany times, andwhen they finally became tired ofsending,
beganthefeast without him. Then hetold hisslave togooverand
see iftheywere already eating, andonhisreturn hesaid, &quot;Theyare
havingagrandtime. Theyareeatingagreat quantityof food.&quot;
&quot;Take methere,&quot; saidRaven tohisslaves. Sotheywent along
withhim,oneoneach side.When hecame there hesawthatthey
werehavingagrandtimedistributing boxes offood toallthehead
chiefs, andhesaid toaslave,&quot;Askthem where thischief shall sit.&quot;
Hedidso,buttheywent onwith their feast without payingthe
slightest attention tohim. ThenRaven made hisslave askagain,
&quot;Where shall this chief sit?Where shall thischief sit?&quot; andagain
theypaidnoattention, although heshouted sothat allinthehouse
could hearhim.When thepeoplelefthewas stillstanding around,
sohisslaves said tohim, &quot;Why wereyousoparticular? Wecould
havehadagreatdeal to eat.&quot; After allweregoneRaven atethe
leavings.
Sonowadays, when aperson wants more thananyoneelseand
makes people send forhimagain andagain, they goonwith the
feast, lestthose oftheopposite partythink that thehost caresmore
forthisoneperson than foralltherestofthem andleave hishouse.
That iswhythey paidnoattention toRaven when hedidcome.
Onereason whyRaven stayed away wasthathethought hewould
make themcome afterhimseveral times because hehadpromised
togiveafeast inreturn. Nowadays aperson who isgoingtogive a
feast acts inthesame way,andpeople knowbyitwhat heintends.
Thefollowing winter Raven gavehisfeast. Thiswas atAlsek
river, andyoucan still seehishouse there with theboxes inside [a
rockhollowed outlikeacavewith other rocks inside ofit].When
theycame insightofthattheIndians would praytoit.
Assoon ashisguests came, Raven wentdown tomeetthem with
hisbowandarrows. That iswhy people nowgodown with their
guns. Hehadsomuchrespectforhisguests thathehad allofhis
relations actasservants, washingtheirhands andwaitingonthem
while theyate. Therefore thenatives now actjustsowhen they
invitepeople from other towns. Raven taught that allwhocame
aftershould dojustashehaddone. Healsoprepared chewing tobacco
forhisguests.
Then hebegan buildinghishouse, and,when theframe, consisting
offouruprights andtwocross-pieces, wascompleted, heand his
friends danced the first dance. Inthisdance people singfuneral
songs. Eight songs,oronesongwitheight verses, areused atthis

know thesongstarts itandbegins with thewrong verse,itislooked
onasadisgracetohispeople. Theguests danced, wearingtheir
masks, hats,emblem coats, andother festalparaphernalia. After
thathedistributed hisproperty,thepeoplethathadinvited him
before andtheleading chiefs obtaining most ofit.a
After thisRaven returned totheplace where hewasbornand
found theboxwhich hadheld thesun,moon, andstars, andwhich
nowcontained hismother,stillhanging upinthehouse ofNas-cA kl-

Then hewent toNas-cA ki-yeTs house, tookdown theboxwhich
contained hismother,6andliberated theflickers (kun) which she
always kept under herarms. When Nas-cA ki-yel saw that, he
said,UA11those pretty thingsofmine aregone.&quot; Theyknew that

Nas-cAki-yel said,&quot;Goand fellthat treestanding overthere,&quot;for

itcould not killhimbecause hewasmade ofrock. Finding him still
alive, Nas-c Aki-yelcalled him inthefollowing dayand said,&quot;Go
andclean outthat canoe.&quot; Itwasacanoejustbeing made, and
when Raven gotinto ittoclean itout itclosed uponhim. Then he
simply extended hiselbows andbroke thecanoe after which he
smashed itupforfirewood. AllthisNas-cA ki-yel saw,andagain

gettoherandmarry her,butheguarded hervery closely. Finally amanreached herandpulled aside
herarms, letting free allofthelandanimals andseacreatures shehadbeenkeeping there. Thatwas
whyherhusband wassojealous about her. Afterward thehusband raised aflood, butonemanheard

Quite awhile before thisflood tookplace theshamans hadpredicted

enemies know about it.
After awhile heheard this oldmancoming along, talking very
loud,likeabraveperson, andhethought,&quot;This istheoldmanfrom

peopleofthatvillage sawthat thechiefwasdead. They thought
thathehaddied ofheartdisease, but,when theyexamined hisbody,
theyfound thesmall arrowsticking into hisheart. Then they cut

Then thechildren ofthesunwere allveryhappy, andmade so

Therefore nowadays people dothesamething. When they fight

Therefore shetookgoodcareinselectingahusband forherdaughter,

That iswhytheIndians ofgood family took suchgood care ofa

When theinhabitants ofthattownbecame verynumerous the

When thisgirlhad lostalmost allthedentalia from herclothing

alwaysfullofhalibut, seal,andsea-lion meat.
Then hisgrandmothersaid tohim, &quot;Grandson, donotgoover
inthat direction. None ofthevillage people gothere, andthose
whohave done sonever returned.&quot; This, however, onlymade the
boyanxious toseewhatwasthetrouble, sohewent there and,kill
ingsome sealsandhalibut, putthem into thewater toentice the
creature up. Finally hesawagigantic crab (s!a-u) coming upinthe
sea, soheputhisclub into theocean, and itbroke thecrab sshell
andkilled it.Then heandhisslavepulledthebigcrab ashore, andhe
took aload ofitsfleshhome tohisgrandparents. Hisgrandparents
hadworried allthetimehewasaway, buthismother knew thather
sonhadpowerover allkinds offish,because hisfather ischief ofthe
sea. Everythinginthesea isunder him.
Another time hisgrandmother said tohim,&quot;There isaplace over
inthisdirection where lives abigmussel(yis!). Nocanoe canpass
itwithout being chewedup.&quot; Sohewent tothemussel and killed
that.Hetook allofitsshellhome, andthepeople throughoutthe
village boughtitofhim forspears, arrowpoints, andknives.
Atthesame timehealsobrought home aload ofcockles, clams,
andother shellfish. IntheTsimshian countrytheshellfish arefine,
andthemussels arenotpoisonousastheyarehere. InAprilthe
Alaskans donotdare toeatshellfish, especially mussels, claiming
thattheyarepoisonous.Itisbecause hekilled thebigmussel that
theyare allpoisonoushere. Since histime, too,boysandgirlshave
donewhatever their fathers used todo.
After that theboymarried andhadasonwhowasveryunlike
him. Hisname wasMan-that-eats-the-leavings (Q!a-i t6-cuka-qa),
and,when hegrew up,hewas worthless. Heseemed toseethe
shellfish, however, andunderstood theshellfish language.
Atthesame time thedaughterofthechief inacertain village not

where shehadgone. Thisyoungmanwasthedevilfish, whom she
married, andshehadseveral children byhim. Meanwhile, asshe
wastheir only child, herparents weremourningforhercontinually.
Aftersome timehadpassed, herparents sawtwosmall devilfishes on
thestepsofthechief shouseearlyinthemorning, andthepeople
said tothechief,&quot;What devilfishes arethese hereonthesteps?&quot;
Hesaid,&quot;Throw themdown onthe beach.&quot; Theydidso,butthe
little devilfishes cameright back. They threw themdownagain,
butthechief said,&quot;Iftheycomeupthethird time, leavethem alone.
Letthem dowhat they will,butwatch themclosely.&quot; Then they
came rightintothechief shouse, andoneclimbed intothechief slap
while theother gotintothat ofhiswife.Hesaid, &quot;Mydaughter must
have gonetoliveamong the devilfishes.&quot; Toseewhat theywould
do,hesaid, &quot;My grandchildren,isthisyou?&quot; Upon which theyput
their tentacles around hisneckandbegan moving about. Then he
gavethemsome foodonlong platters, andthey acted asthough they
were eating from these. Afterward hesaid,&quot;Take thoseplatters and
follow them alongtoseewhere they go.&quot;Theydidsoandsawthem
disappear under alarge rockjustinfront ofthetown. Sothepeople
came backandsaid tothechief, &quot;They went under thatlarge rock
down there. Your daughter must beunder there also.&quot; When the
people gotupnextmorning theysawonthestepstheplatters they
hadtaken down, wiped veryclean.
Now thechief feltvery badly,forheknewwhathadhappenedto
hisdaughter,sohesaid tothepeopleinhishouse,&quot;Godown and
invitemydaughter, and say,Your father wants youtocome to
dinner.&quot; :Sotheywentdown and said,&quot;Your father hassentus
toinvite you,your children, andyourhusband tocome todinner at
his house.&quot; &quot;We arecoming,&quot;said thewoman from under the
beach,&quot;sogoback.Wewillbethere soon.&quot; Sheknew thevoices
ofallofherhusband sservants. When thesecame back tothechief,
hesaid,&quot;Did youaskher? Didyougothere?&quot;&quot;Yes, wewere
there.&quot; &quot;What didyousayto her?&quot; &quot;We toldherjustwhatyou
wanted ustosaytoher. Shesaidthatherhusband, herchildren,
andherself would behere soon.&quot;
Sothepeople watched forher,andbyandbyshecameupalong
with herdevilfish husband andwith thetwo little devilfishes right
behind her.Hermarten-skin robewasrotten,allsorts ofseaweeds
were inherhair,andshelooked badly, although shehadformerly
been very pretty. Herfather andmother were very sorry. Then
theysetoutfood forthem andafterward took thetraysdown tothe
place where the little oneshadgoneunder therock.
Now thechief invited allofthepeopleinto hishouse, gavethem
tobacco tochew, andtoldthemhowbadly hefelt. After theyhad


132 BUREAU OFAMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BULL. 39
talked thematter over forawhile they said tohim,&quot;You mightas
wellhave allthedevilfishes killed. When those small ones aregrown
upyoudonotknow what theywilldotoyourhouse.&quot; Sothey
invited thedevilfishes again,killed thebigone,threw the little ones
down onthebeach, andkeptthegirl.Byandby,however, the
girlsaid toherfather,&quot;There isgoing tobeaterrible war. Allof
thedevilfish areassembling. Don tallow anyofthepeopleofyour
town tosleepatnight. Letthem watch.&quot; So,when night came
on,theycould seelargeandsmall devilfishes cominginthrough every
little crack until thehouse gotquitefullofthem, andsome people
were suffocated byhaving thedevilfishes cover their mouths. The
devilfish thattheyhad killed waschiefamong them.
Just then Man-that-eats-the-leavings came tothat town, and
theytoldhimwhat ahard timetheywerehaving every night with
thedevilfish,sohestayed withthem until evening. When they
came inthistimeheseemed tohave control overthem, andthey
ceased bothering thepeople. Thelargedevilfishes arecalled dAgasa/.
Thesmall ones,which theythrew down onthebeach, arethose that
theAlaskan Indians see,butthese donotinjure anyone nowbecause
their grandfather wasahuman being.
Afterward theybathed thegirltotake allthedevilfish offofher,
andputfineclothing onher.Herfacewasvery pretty,sothat all
theneighboringchiefs wanted tomarryher. Inolden times agood
looking woman wasconsidered high-caste,fortheyknew shewould
marry well,andagood looking woman among thehigh-caste people
wasconsidered very high.
Among thosewhowanted tomarrythisgirlwasMan-that-eats-the-

thechief sdaughter without herfather sconsent andtookhertohis

Byandbythechief sdaughter wasmissed, andtheyhunted for

Hermother hadintended totake herhome andhave herhusband

customaryinthecase ofawoman whose daughter married without
herconsent. Itmeant that shewantedproperty. And before she
hadsatthere very long, hernewson-in-law handed outeight bright

&quot;You mustshowmehow. Iwillpayyouwell. Iwant verymuch

said,&quot;You have tofast. Ifyoudothatyouwill learn. Fast

danced farbetter. Atthistheyouthsboyfriends said tohim,
&quot;What makes youdosuch athing? Itdoesn tlook rightforyou

because theywerejealousofhim. Sohewent tothemanwhohad
instructed him,andthelatter said, &quot;Peoplewilldothis (i.e.,dance)

you.&quot; Theyouth hadcomposed somany beautiful songs that all
thegirlshadfallen inlovewithhim. Thatwaswhytheother youths
were jealousofhim. The firstdancer also said tohim,&quot;It isnot
high-caste peoplelikeyourself merely who willcompose songs. Every
bodywilllearn these andcompose others. Anybody thatcomposes
songslikethisafterhaving made medicine willhave hisnamebecome
greatinthe world.&quot;
When thisyouth hadtold hisfather allhehadlearned, hisfather
asked allthepeopleofthattown tocome tohishouse andrepeated
ittothem. Then hesaid,&quot;Idonotthink itiswell forahigh-caste
persontocompose songs andbeadancer. They saythat apersons
name willbecome very highandbeknown everywhereifhecom
poses songs andbecomes adancer, butachiefs sonsname isalready
high,andachief sname isknown everywhere. Why should hecom
pose songs anddance tomake itso? Itisbetter that thepoorer
people should dothisandmake theirnames known inthe world.&quot;
Ifthechiefhadnotsaidthis,people thatcompose songs anddance
would bevery scarce amongus. Itisbecause thechief said,&quot;Let
itbeamong thepoorer peoplesothat theirnames maybeknown/
that there aresomany composers anddancers among us.Forno
chiefcomposesordances without giving awayagreat dealofproperty.
Thus ithappens thatthere aretwokinds ofdances, adance forthe
chiefandhissonsand thiscommon orHaida dance (Dekl naALle x).
Inthelatter,women always accompanyitwith songs, and,ifthe
composer sings about some good family, members ofthelatter give
himpresents. When thechief isgoingtodance, hehastobevery
careful nottosayanything outoftheway. Hedances wearinga
head dress with weasel skins, aChilkat blanket, andleggings and
carryingaraven rattle. He istheonlyonewhose voice isheard, and
hespeaks very quietly. Meanwhile, until itistime forthem tostart
singingforhim, thepeoplearevery quiet andthen only high-caste
people sing. TheHaida dance, however,isalways accompanied by
noise. Itisrather adance forpleasure,while thechief sdance is
more ofaceremony. Although most ofthepeople whowitness it
arehigh-caste, anyoneiswelcome. Allwatch the.chiefs actions and
listen tohiswords very closely.Ifhemakes theleast mistake, show
ingthathehasnotstudied hiswords beforehand very well,theyhave
toomuch respectforhim tosayanythingtohimatthat time. Next
day,however, afterhehasfound itout,ifhedoesnottake hiswords
back, thepeoplethathadheard willdisgrace himbygiving awaya
great deal ofproperty. TheHaida dance wasdoneaway with years
ago,while thechief sdance hasbeen given uponlyinveryrecent
times.

Onetime fourboyswent outhunting fromKlawak withbowand

who sent hisspiritafterthem tothepoint onthebeach fromwhich
theyhad setout.Then theshamansaid,&quot;Thespiritsoftheboys
seem tohave taken theroad totheland-otters dens.&quot; Therefore
theykeptonuntil theysawtheboysuponapointofland, but, as
soon asthelatter sawthem, theyranintothedens oftheland otter.
Then thetown chief said,&quot;Let thewhole town gather pitchwood and

their canoes, made fires atthemouths ofthedensandkilled theland

After thistheshaman said,&quot;The land otters aregoingtomake
waruponthepeople here,&quot; andsoon after they didso.Thepeople
attacked them inreturn andthey warred forsome time. Many
peoplefelldown suddenly andweretakensick, while others were in
jured byhavinglimbs oftrees fallupontheir heads. Theshaman
saidthat thesemishapswerereallyeffects oftheland-otters arrows,

from boilsandpimplesallover their bodies, andhesaidthat these

theonly things theyfeared.
Finallytheshaman sawthatthere weretwowhite landotters, and
hesaid,&quot;Ifyoucangethold ofthoseyouwillbeallright.&quot; Then

Yes,&quot; theyanswered. Itwascaused
bythetwohigh-caste white land otterswhoweretalkingtoTuxsta&quot;s

Nextmorningthemen arose very early, andtheeldest said tothe

andsetout. Going along ontheopposite side ofthepoint onwhich
theyhadcamped, theysawthetwowhite otters swimming inthe

said tothem, &quot;Staythere.Wehavehadyouforalongtime now.&quot;
Sotheotters remained where they were, andtheycaught them and
putfeathers upontheir heads. They weremaking deer ofthem.
They tookthemhome tothefort inwhichthey dwelt andcarried
them in.Allthepeople danced forthem. And thatnight,after
theyhadretired, thepeople dreamt thattheland otters weredancing
thepeace-making dance. Some ofthepeople said, &quot;They really
danct,&quot; butothersreplied, &quot;No, they didnotdance. Weonly
dreamt it.&quot; Still they dressed uptodance inreturn. Allwere
fasting,aswascustomary when peaceisabout tobemade. They
alsofedtheland otters andwaited uponthem very carefully.
Byandbytheshaman saidthat theland otters were coming,so
thepeople made readyforthem. They soaked averybitter root,
calledslikc, inwater foralong time. Some said, &quot;Theyarenotcom

Thenextmorningitwasveryfoggy andthey could notseefarout,
butthey heard adrumbeating. Atlengththeland-otter-people
came ashore, andthey helped them carrytheir things uptothe
houses. One ofthese land otters hadtwoheads, oneunder theother.
ItwasTutsIIdiguL.Allsaid,&quot;Wedepend onTutsIIdiguL.&quot;Then
numbers ofland otters came intothehouse, but, assoon asTuts!-

down asifdead. Theshaman inturn filled hismouth with thepoi
sonous water theyhadprepared andspititabout upontheotters,
rendering unconscious allthat ittouched. Theland otters, however,
shouted,&quot;KeepawayfromTutslldiguL.Lethimdohis work.&quot; So
TutslldiguLdanced, saying,&quot;Ha,ha,ha.&quot;When theystarted asong,
theland otters mentioned TutslidiguLsname inthemanner ofthe

Now thepeopleofthattown wereverymuchfrightened, andnone
ofthemwentaway. Theyhadheard before thattheland otters have
death and allkinds ofsickness fortheirbows andarrows, butuntil
thentheyhadnotbelieved it.Afterward thepeople began tostarve,
andthechildrenespecially suffered verymuch. One child,whomust
havebeen very poor, would cryatnight withhunger. After hehad

Atthesame time Black-skin wasmerely feigning weakness, and,
though hecontinued tolieinbedwhen theothers bathed, atnight
after allwereasleep, hewould steal offanddothesamething himself
forhours andhours. Heremained insolong thathehadtofloat to

butinreality hekepthimself verypureandwould not lieorsteal.
Hedidnotsayawordwhentheymade funofhim,though hewas
strong enoughtohave done almost anythingtothem ifhehad so
desired. When they senthimafterbigpiecesoffirewood heacted as

theygavehimverylittle toeat.
Thepeople wentoninthisway,bathing every daywith theirchief,
while Black-skin bathed atnight. After they werethrough,the
village people would make abig fire,takebreakfast andthengoafter
wood. Assoon asthepeople cameup,Black-skin moved into a
corner andsleptthere. Onenight, while Black-skin wasbathing, he
heard awhistle thatsounded tohim likethat ofaloon. Hethought,
&quot;Now that Iamseen Ibetter letmyself go.&quot; Sohewenttoward the
place where hehadheard itandsawashort, thick-set manstanding
onthebeach clothed inabear skin. Thismanrandown toward him,
picked himup,andthrew himdownuponthebeach. Then hesaid,
&quot;You can tdoityet.Don ttellanyone about me. IamStrength
(Latsl n). Ihavecome tohelp you.&quot;
Toward morning Black-skin came infeeling very happy,forhe
thoughtthathehadseensomething great. Hekept thinkingof
Strengthallthetime. Hecould notforget him,buthewasquieter
than ever inhisdemeanor. When theywere playinginthehouse he
would never payanyattention, and,iftheysaidmeanthingstohim,
heletthem goonunnoticed, although hebelongedtothefamilyofthe

Inolden times theboysused towrestle inthechief shouse while their

Sometimes the littleboyswould wrestle with him,andhepretended
thattheypushed himdown. Thentheywould make fun ofhim
saying,&quot;The idea ofagreatman likeyoubeing thrown byachild.&quot;
When hewent inbathing again,thisman feltveryhappyfor he-

Andoneboy said, &quot;WhythisBlack-skin will sitinthebow ofthe

Black-skin listened toallthis,buthepaidnoattention tothem. The

almost livedonthissea-lion meat, but itwasveryscarce andonly

slippery because thesealionsstayedthere allofthetimeandveryfew

Theelder ofthechief stwowives hadhadpityonBlack-skin, and
would dolittle favors forhimonthesly. SoBlack-skin, afterhehad

Seeingthathewasdetermined to-getintheybegan pushingthecanoe

struck hisfingerstomakehim letgo.Itsounded likebeating upona

verylittle ofhisstrength, pulled thecanoe back, andjumpedin.
Then thepeopletalked verymeanlytohim,butthechief said,uOh!

hesatintheplace where onebails. Theuncle might havesuspected

alongtotearthesealions in two.&quot; They asked him,&quot;How many
sealions shall Iskin foryou?&quot; ButBlack-skin saidnothing.
The sea-lion island hadvery precipitoussides against which great
waves came, soGUlwe t!waited until thecanoe was lifteduponthe

andseizing asmall sealionbythe tailsmashed itshead topieces on

Now,when Black-skin sawwhathadhappenedtohisuncle, hefelt
badly. Then heputhishand into hisbundle ofclothes, tookoutand
putonhishairornament andhisshirt, while allwatched him,andsaid,
&quot;Iamtheman thatpulledoutthat limb, and Iamtheman that

and alllistened tohim.Hesaidtothem,&quot;Take thecanoe closer to

which broke under hisweight, precipitatingtheir occupantstothe
bottom ofthecanoe. Theyoungmenthatweresittinginhiswayhe

frightened, thinking thathewould revenge himself onthem fortheir
meanness, buthejumpedashore where hisunclehadgoneandwalked
straight upthe cliff. Thesmall sealions inhiswayhekilled simply
byhitting them ontheheadandbystepping onthem. Helooked
onlyatthebigonethathadkilled hisuncle,forhedidnotwant itto

leavehimoutthere? Why didn tyoubringhim in?&quot;
Meanwhile Black-skin took outthesea-lion intestines anddried
them. Hehadnothingtomake afirewithanddidnotknow what
heshould do.Sohelaydown andwent tosleep,hishead covered
with hisblanket. Then heheard somethingthatsounded likethe
beatingofsticks. Suddenly hewasawakened byhearing someone
say,&quot;Ihavecome afteryou.&quot; Helooked around, butcould notsee
anything exceptablack duckwhich wasswimming about infront of
him. Then hesawtheblack duckcoming toward himandsaidtoit,
&quot;Ihave seenyou already.&quot;Itanswered,&quot;Iamsent after you.

Whydofishdieoncoming outofthewater ?Itisbecause theyhave

Meanwhile theelder wife ofthechief,whohadhelped Black-skin,
wasmourningforherhusband andnephew. Herhusband sbody
was stillonthat island. The olderpeoplewere alsosayingtothe
people whohad lefthim, &quot;Whydidyoudoit?Apowerfulfellow

widow begged theyoungmen togoback totheisland andbringhome
hernephew andherhusband sbody buttheyoungerwife didnot

there, butBlack-skin wasgone. Then theytookaboard thebody,
loaded thecanoe with thebodies ofsealions, andwenthome. When
theyheard ofitthewisepeopleallsaidthatsomething waswrong.
Theshamans saidthathewasnotdeadandthattheywould seehim
again. Theysaid thathewas offwithsome wild animal. This
troubled thevillage peopleagreatdeal. Theyfeltvery badlyto
think thathehadkepthimself soverylowlybefore thelow-caste peo

Black-skin, however, continued tostayamong thesealions. They
looked tohim likehuman beings,butheknewwhothey reallywere.
Inthesamehouse therewasaboycryingallthetimewithpain. The

placedthefishthere. Hewasglad tothink thathecouldgetsome

One day, while hewasroasting fish,hesaweight Athapascans
(Gonana), andknew from that thathewas intheinterior. These
menwore nicefurclothing andhad their facespainted. Kakeq!ute
became frightened andranintothewoods, leavinghisfishroasting
bythe fire. Afterward theeightmen acted asthough theywere
calling him,soheclimbed upintoatreeandwatched them. They
didnotknow where hehadgone. Then themen satdown andate
hisfish,after which they stuck acopper-pointed arrow into the
ground where each roastingstickhadbeen. Thiswasthefirsttime

Next daythesamemencame back. They were dressed much
better, andtwonice-looking women were with them. Then they

Now they tookhim totheplace fromwhich they gottheir fish
andshowed himhowtheydid it. Itwasbymaking deadfalls in

Byandbythesalmon season came. Thepeopletherehadcopper-
pointed salmonspears (kkt) withhandles offine,thinwood, butthe
water was somuddy thatthey couldspear onlybymeans ofthe
ripple marks, andoften gotbutoneortwoaday. Themost that
anymanobtained was three.
KakeqKe watched andknew that hecouldhelp them. He
alwaystraveled around with hiswives brothers, andwherever they
went thepeople followed,fortheythought thatheknewhow toget
salmon. Heinquiredifthiswere theonlywaytheyknew oftocatch
salmon, andthey said, &quot;Yes,this istheonlywayexceptthatwhen
they getinashallowplacewecanclub them.&quot; One ofhisbrothers-

theyareveryoldandtheir flesh isturning white. Then thewater
islow,andtheygonear theshore where wecanseethem.Wecan
alsogetthem atthattimefrom the little creeks thatcome intothe

andtaught himhow tofeelalong theriver forsalmon andcatch
them onthebarbs assoon astheywere felt. Inhalfanhourhehad
sixsalmon. Allthepeopleofthevillage were looking on.Then he
said tohisbrother-in-law,&quot;You can feelthem very easily. They

Next daythewholevillage went toworkmaking salmontraps.
Again heasked them togetyoungtreesandsplitthem. Alldidas
hetoldthem. Theymade eighteen traps thatday. They gotroots
andsplit them, and allworked taking thebark off.Thewhole
village imitated KakeqHe, watching hisevery movement. Next
daytheyputthetrapsinto thewater, and allwere very anxious
about them, even thewomensitting along theshore watching. Some
ofthepoor people, whoknew thattheywould result similarlytothe
firsttraps hehadmade, were soanxious toseethem thattheycould
notsleep. Thedaybefore allofthewomen satdown tomake ropes
inthemanner heshowed them, andeachwent tothetraps next
morning provided with one.When theygotthere theyfound every
oneofthem loaded with salmon. Allthepeopleinthetown, old
andyoung, went toseethesetraps. While theywereemptyingthe
traps andstringing some ofthesalmon, others would becoining in,

and itmade thewhole village happy. ThenKakeq!utedistributed
thesalmon,foreveryone thought that itbelonged tohim.Hegave
tothepoor people, whohadnever before tastedsalmon, andhesaid
tothewealthy,&quot;Don tfeeloffended that Igivethem asmuch as

Atthistime oftheyeartheynever gotanysalmon todry.Ifone

theydryit.Eachmanhadaplace where hespeared salmon, and
noonedared gothere. Those spots were allnamed. When they
gotsalmon from thetraps theywere allrich,andtheywere glad to

theyateevery partofthesalmon,alltheinsides, theheart, etc.,but
after theyhadhadthetrapsforafewdaysyoucould seealong the
beach various partsofthe fish, astheheads, andevensome good

That falltheAthapascans wentupamongthevalleysforground
hogs,eachmanhavinghisownplace, where nooneelsewasallowed to

Before histime theAthapascansdidnotknowhow toputuptheir

when theyinvited peopletothefeast forthese houses, theyfirstgave
awaytheslaves theyhadbeen buying. TheLluklnAxA difeltvery
badlyatthis, because Flathead slaves notbeing esteemed very
highlythisamounted tomore than theyhadgiven away. kThen
warbroke outbetween thetwo families, andtheL!uk!nAXA diwere
badly defeated, losing many people.After that thepeople -whose
friends hadbeen enslaved, purchased, andgiven awayfeltsobadly
thattheyalsomadewarontheGanAxte diwithnobetter result.
One oftheGanAxte dichiefs wasnamed Yel-xak. Inthose times
people were afraid ofahigh-caste person whowasrich, strong, and
brave anddidnotwant tohaveanythingtodowithhim. Thisman s
father-in-law wasaLluklnAxA dichief atLaxayi knamed BigRaven
(Yel-Len). ThenYel-xak told hisslaves totakefoodandtobacco to
hisfather-in-law through theinterior byAlsekriver, andhedidso.
When hearrived, thechief said tohim,&quot;What didyoucome for?&quot;
&quot;Your daughter hassentmewithsome tobacco/ BigRaven was
very fond oftobacco. Before theslave started onthiserrand his
master hadsaid tohim,&quot;Besure tonotice every word hesayswhen,
yougivehimthe tobacco.&quot; Then theslave tookaway from the
tobacco thecottonwood leaves andafinepieceofmoose hide inwhich
itwaswrapped. Assoon ashesawtheleaves BigRavensaid,&quot;Ifeel
asthoughIhadseenChilkat nowthat Ihave seen these cottonwood
leaves. Chilkat isarespectable place.Alotofrespectable people
livethere. They aresogood thatthey givefoodeven tothepeople
thatwere goingtofightthem.&quot; ThisBigRaven wasashaman and
averyrichone.
When theslave returned toChilkat andtold hismaster what Big
Raven hadsaid,theyheldacouncil thesame eveninginCkuwu-yels
house, Whale house, andYel-xak said tohisslave,&quot;Nowyoutellthese
people what that father-in-law ofmine hassaid toyou.&quot; And the
slave said,&quot;Assoon ashesawme,hesaid,What areyoudoing here?
and Itoldhimthat hisdaughter hadsentmetohimwith tobacco.
After hehaduncovered thetobacco andhadseen theleaves hesaid,
Theyaresuchrespectable peopleinChilkat thattheyfeedeven the
people whohadcome tofight them. That waswhat BigRaven
said.&quot; ThenYel-xaksaid,&quot;Iwonder ifhethinks hehasgotten even
withmefortheL!uk!nAxA diIkilled onLand-otterpoint.Iwonder
whether hethinks hehasgotten even withmeforhaving killed all
those atAnAk!-nu.&quot; Hethought thatBigRaven wasacoward and
wasgoingtomakepeace. Then hemoved about veryproudly, while
thevisitors from other places watched himclosely, andeverything
thathesaidordidwasreportedtoBigRaven.

Thepeople said,&quot;What areyousaying, BigRaven? Gowherever

thought that itgrewinthetimber andnotthat itbelonged toaship.
Thistheycalled Gayes!hawu(LogofIron). Gayes!wasoriginally

Now thewarcanoes started from Kosle xforChilkat, drilling as
they went. Whenpeople dothisthe} take outtheirdrums and
drillwhereverpossible. There arecertain songs called&quot;drilling
songs.&quot; When theshaman said,&quot;This istheplace where LAkua

these fortheir helpwithcopper plates.Allthistime theshaman s
spirit sang thesame song about &quot;the raven swinging back and

Atlastthewarriors reached Chilkat andstood inarowfronting
theriver back oftheChilkat fort. Behind allstood Cadisi ktc.
Then Yel-xak came outontopofthefortand said,&quot;Where isthat
Cadisi ktc?&quot; SoCadisi ktcstepped outinfront ofhisparty with the

Heanswered,&quot;Ihavebeen inthatgreatmountain thatbelonged to
mymother suncle, andIhavecome outafteryou.&quot;After thisthey
heard adrum inthefort,which meant that those peoplewereabout

41.THEIMAGE THATCAME TOLIFE
Ayoungchief ontheQueen Charlotte islands married, andsoon
afterwards hiswife fell ill.Then hesentaround everywhereforthe
very bestshamans. Ifthere were averyfineshaman atacertain
village hewould send acanoe there tobring him. None ofthem
could help her,however, andafter shehadbeen sick foravery long
time shedied.
Now theyoungchief feltverybadly over thelossofhiswife. He
wentfromplacetoplaceafter thebestcarvers inorder tohavethem
carve animageofhiswife, butnoonecouldmake anythingtolook
likeher. Allthistime therewasacarver inhisownvillage whocould
carvemuch better than alltheothers. Thismanmethimoneday
andsaid,&quot;You aregoing fromvillagetovillagetohavewood carved
likeyour wife sface,andyoucannotfindanyonetodoit,canyou?
Ihave seenyour wifeagreatdealwalking along with you.Ihave
never studied herfacewith theideathatyoumight wantsome oneto
carveit,butIamgoingtotryifyouwillallow me.&quot;
Then thecarver went after apieceofredcedar andbegan working
uponit.When hewasthrough, hewent totheyoungchiefandsaid,
&quot;Now youcancome along andlook at it.&quot;Hehaddressed itjustas
heused toseetheyoungwoman dressed. Sothechiefwentwithhim,
and,when hegotinside, hesawhisdead wifesittingtherejustasshe
used tolook. Thismadehimveryhappy, andhetook ithome. Then
heasked thecarver,&quot;What doIoweyouformakingthis?&quot; andhe
replied,&quot;Do asyouplease about it.&quot;Thecarver had feltsorryto
seehow thischiefwasmourningforhiswife, sohesaid,&quot;It isbecause
Ifeltbadlyforyouthat Imade that. Sodon tpaymetoomuch for
it.&quot;Hepaid thecarver very well, however, both inslaves and in
goods.
Now thechief dressed thisimageinhiswife sclothes andher
marten-skin robe. Hefeltthat hiswifehadcome back tohimand
treated theimage justlike her.Oneday, while hesatmourning
veryclose totheimage, hefelt itmove. Hiswifehad alsobeen
veryfond ofhim. Atfirsthethought that themovement wasonly

hisimagination, yetheexamined itevery day,forhethought that
atsome time itwould come tolife.When heatehealways hadthe
imageclose tohim.
After awhile thewhole village learned thathehad thisimage and
allcame intosee it.Manycould notbelieve that itwasnotthe
woman herself until theyhadexamined itclosely.
Oneday,after thechiefhadhad itforalong, long time, heexam
ined thebody andfound itjustlikethat ofahuman being. Still,
althoughitwas alive,itcould notmove orspeak. Some timelater,
however, theimage gaveforth asound from itschest likethat of
crackling wood, andthemanknew that itwas ill.When hehad
some onemove itaway from theplace where ithadbeensitting they
found asmall red-cedar treegrowingthere ontopoftheflooring.
Theyleft ituntil itgrewtobevery large, and itisbecause ofthisthat
cedars ontheQueen Charlotte islands aresogood. Whenpeople up
thiswaylook forredcedars and find agood onethey say,&quot;This
looks likethebabyofthechief swife.&quot;
Every daytheimageoftheyoungwoman grewmore likeahuman
being, and,when theyheard thestory, people fromvillagesfarand
nearcame intolook atitandattheyoung cedar treegrowing there,
atwhich theywereverymuch astonished. Thewoman moved around
verylittleandnever gottotalk,butherhusband dreamed what she
wanted totellhim. Itwasthroughhisdreams thatheknew shewas

heraunt said,&quot;Ihaveputalivecoal inthatbrush house along with

Assoon astheothers hadgoneaway theorphan made abigfire
andcooked herroots andsalmon, butshedidnot feel likeeating.
Therefore, instead ofdoing so,shewrentaway anddugsome more
roots. Intheevening shewent back toherbrush house, thinking
shecould eatnow, butfound that shehadnoappetite. Soshe
laydown andwent tosleep. Earlyinthemorning shewasawak
enedbyagreat noisewhich shefound onlooking outwasmadebya
flock ofbrants(qen). She feltsotired thatshelaydown again and
went tosleep, and,when sheawoke oncemore, shethought shewould
setoutaftermore roots. Going down tothe flatwhere these roots
grew, shefound itcovered with brants feeding upon them. When
theysawhertheyflewaway. Then shebegan removing thedead
grass from theplace where shewasgoingtodig,andtohersurprise

which were loaded witheulachonoil,dried eulachon, driedhalibut,
anddried salmon. She feltveryhappy. Shethought howluckyit
wasthat shehadremained therewhen allofthevillage people were
starving.
Now theorphan thought thatshewould eatsomething, soshetook
some salmon andabundle ofhalibut home with her.Onroasting
apieceofsalmon, however, shefound thatshecould noteat it.She
didnotknow whathadgottenintoherthatshecould notforce her
selftoeat. Shewished thatherauntwerewith her. Nextmorning
shediscovered that thespirits were keeping foodaway from her
because shewasbecoming ashaman. Thebrants hadbecome her
spirits. Thebrantspirits always come toRaven peoplelike her.
Soshebecame agreatshaman andwaspossessed byspirits every
day, while seagulls, crows, and allkinds ofseaandwoodland birds
sangforher. Thishappened every day. T\vo orthree times aday
shewould gotoseetheburied canoes, butshecould noteatanything,
andshegaveupdigging roots because shehadnowayofsharpening
hersticks. Meanwhile everyoneinthevillage thought that shehad
starved todeath.
Aftersome timehadpassed,thegirlwished thatsomeonewould come
toherfrom thevillage, andthedayafter acanoe appearedinsight.
Thismade herveryhappy, especially when itgotcloseandshefound
itcontained some peopleofheracquaintance from thevillage. She
called themuptoherbrush house andgavethemsome foodfrom the

nottake abitofthefood Ihave given you. Leave itallhere. Tell
thepeopleofourvillage thatDjfyinisstillliving and isdoingwell.
Tellmyaunt thatshemusttrytogethere assoon asshe can.&quot;
When these people gotback tothevillage andtoldwhathadhap
penedtotheorphan, howmuch food shehadandhowlucky she
hadbeen,allthetown people whohadbeen dyingofstarvation
started offimmediatelyfortheplace where shewasliving. When
theycame insightofherbrush house theysawthatfrom thesky

Assoon astheshaman heard that herpeople werecoming she
walked outtomeetthem andasked,uWhich canoe ismyaunt in?
Letherland here.7Allofthefood inoneofhercanoes shegaveto
heraunt. Then shesaid,&quot;Iwant twowomen tocome ashore to
helpmewithmy singing.&quot; The high-caste women inthecanoes,
whowere allpainted up,would riseoneafter theother, butshewould
nothave them, andfinallycalled twowhowereorphanslikeherself
andhadbeen treated verybadly bytheirownpeople.Alltheothers
then started tocome ashore, andshetoldthemwhere tocamp. She
hadroom enough inherownhouseonlyforthetwogirlsandher

These high-caste people hadbroughttheir slaves withthemwhen
theycame toher,andshegotthem herself inexchangeforfood.
Shehadthree brush houses built toholdthem. Shealsodressed up
thetwo littleorphanssothattheylooked very pretty. After along
time thepeoplelefthertoreturn totheirownvillage, and,when
another longperiod hadelapsed, herspiritmade thetown chiefsick,
andthey hired hertocome andtreat him.
Thisshaman hadbelonged toavery high-caste family, butthey
haddied offand leftherverypoor,andnothing remained ofheruncle s
houseexcept theposts. Grass grewallabout inside ofit,andwhen
theshaman wasentering thevillage shesawtheposts ofheruncle s

lookedup,raised aneaglestailinonehand, blewupon it,andwaved
itbackandforth infront ofthem. Thefourth time afinehouse
stood there. Then they carried allofherthings intothis,andshe
hadtheslaves shehadprocured work forher,while thetwoorphans
shehadtaken werenowconsidered high caste.
Atthattime thesick chief sdaughter also fell sick. Then the
spirits turned alltheminds ofthechief speople away fromher,and
they paid other shamans inthevillage. The sickones, however,

Theboy,however, floated alongforsome timeandfinally came
ashore insafety onanicesandy beach. The tidewasvery low.
Then heheard thelaughterofsomegirlswhowere outdigging

Ashewalked between thegirls, oneofthem said,&quot;You shall goto

Then they tookhim into their father shouse and their father
said,&quot;Who isthat fellow?&quot; &quot;We found him/ said thesecond,
&quot;andwearegoingtomarryhim.&quot; This onewasvery quickto

Thisgirldeceived herhusband andwent with thesonofthetown

afraid andtold hisslave totakehim offinhiscanoe. Before the
relatives ofthemurdered manfound itoutandhadstarted inpur

veryhardandgotwayoutinto theocean, and,when atlastthe

Nextmorning very early,ashelaythere, themanheard aneagle

abrantwoman (qen). Onedayinspringthiswoman said toher
husband,&quot;Let usgooutside andwatch theflocks ofgeese passing.
Myfather scanoe willsoonbecoming along.&quot; Then theywent out
andsawaflock ofbrant coming. Thebrant seemed tostopoverthe
woman alittle while, andshecalled tothem saying,&quot;Have youany

Next daysheagainsaid toherhusband,&quot;Iamsure thatmy

where thevweresitting, oneofthemmade agreat noisedirectly over
head, andherhusband thought thatmust behiswife sfather. His
wife alsobegan makingthebrant noise inreturn, sothatherhusband
became verymuch frightened. Assoon asshehadfinished sheflew
upamong thebrant people.
Now herhusband started offunder theflock, andranforavery
longtime untilhewasthoroughlytired out. Seeing thathewasnow
sofarbehind thatshecould barelyseehim, hiswifesaid toherfather,
&quot;Father,letuscamphere.&quot; Soherfather hadthemencampthere

hiswifesitting onamat inthehouse withroom enoughforhim
beside her. Thebrants looked tohimjustlikehuman beings. Then
theycooked forthem, andafterward lefttheplace, taking himwith
them. When they reached theplace where theywere tostayall
summer, hesawthattheyworked veryhard togetfood inorder to
take itback.
Some time afterward thesand-hill cranes (dui) and thegeese

Then themanmade waraprons, coats, andhats forthebrants and
forhimself, andhemade himself aclub. Hekilledgreat numbers
ofsand-hill cranes andgeese,while none ofthebrants weredestroyed.
After hehad killed enoughoftheenemytomake upforthebrants

When fallcame andthebrants were readytostart back their

thechief said,&quot;Now wewillcamp out here.&quot; Theplace thathe
referred towas alargerock faroutatsea,andtheycamped upon
it.After theyhadeaten allwent tosleep.
Next morning, however, althoughthemanawokeearly, hefound

notknowwhat heshould do.Hethought,&quot;HowamItogethome

Onemorning hesaid tohimself,&quot;What istheuseofgetting up?&quot;

56.THEBOYWHOSHOTTHESTAR
Twovery high-caste boys were chums. The father ofonewas
town chiefandhad hishouse inthemiddle ofthevillage, butthe
house oftheotherboysfather stood atoneend. These boyswould
goalternatelytoeach other shouses andmakegreat quantitiesof
arrows which theywouldplaywith until allwerebrokenup.
Onetimeboth oftheboysmade agreat quantityofarrows to

andsawthemoon inthesky. Then heclimbed thehill,andlooked
about, buthisfriend wasnotthere. Now hethought,&quot;Well! the

havebeen the moon.&quot;
Theboythus leftalone satdown andcried, afterwhich hebegan

Inthatspotwasalargeandvery brightone.Heshotanarrow at

Now hebegan shootingatthat starfrom thebigpilesofarrows
heand hischum hadmade, andhewasencouraged byseeing that
thearrows didnotcome back. After hehadshot forsome timehe
sawsomething hanging down verynearhim, and,when heshotup
another arrow,itstuck tothis. Thenext didlikewise, andatlastthe
chain ofarrows reached him.Heputalastoneontocompleteit.
Now theyouthfeltbadlyforthe loss ofhisfriend and, lying
down under thearrow chain, hewent tosleep. After awhile he
awoke, found himselfsleeping onthathill,remembered thearrows
hehadshotaway, andlooked up. Instead ofthearrows therewasa
long ladder reaching rightdown tohim.Hearose andlooked so
astomake sure. Then hedetermined toascend.First, however,
hetook various kinds ofbushes andstuckthem intotheknot ofhair
heworeonhishead. Heclimbed uphisladder alldayandcamped
atnightfall upon it,resuminghisjourneythefollowing morning.
When heawokeearly onthesecond morninghishead feltvery
heavy. Then heseized thesalmonberry bush thatwasinhishair,
pulleditout,andfound itwasloaded with berries. After hehad
eaten theberriesoff,hestuck thebranch back into hishairand felt
verymuchstrengthened. About noon ofthesamedayheagainfelt
hungry, andagainhisheadwasheavy,sohepulled outabushfrom
theother side ofhisheadand itwasloaded with blue huckleberries.
Itwasalready summer there inthesky. That waswhyhewas
gettingberries. When heresumed hisjourney nextmorninghis
head didnot feelheavyuntil noon. Atthattimehepulled outthe
bush attheback ofhisheadandfound itloaded with redhuckle
berries.
Bythetimehehadreached thetoptheboywasverytired. He
looked round andsawalargelake. Then hegathered some soft
brush andsomemoss andlaydown tosleep. But, while heslept,
someperson came tohimandshook himsaying,&quot;Getup.Iam

after,my grandson?&quot; andtheboyanswered,&quot;On account ofmy
playmate whowastakenuphither.&quot; ltOh !answered theoldwoman,
&quot;he isnext door, onlyashort distance away.Icanhearhim
crying every day.He isinthemoon shouse.&quot;
Then theoldwoman begantogivehimfood. Shewould puther
handuptohermouth, andasalmon orwhatever shewasgoingto
givewould make itsappearance. After thesalmon shegavehim
berries andthenmeat,forsheknew thathewashungry from his
long journey. After thatshegavehimaspruce cone, arosebush,
apieceofdevil sclub,andasmallpieceofwhetstone totakealong.
Astheboywasgoing toward themoon shouse with allofthese
things heheard hisplaymate screaming withpain. Hehad be.en
putuponahigh place near thesmoke hole, so,when hisrescuer
came toit,heclimbed ontop,and,reaching down through the
smoke hole, pulled himout.Hesaid, &quot;My friend, come. Iamhere
tohelp you.&quot; Puttingthespruce conedown where theboyhad
been, hetold ittoimitate hiscries, andheand hischum ranaway.
After awhile, however, theconedropped from theplace where it
hadbeenput,andthepeople discovered that theircaptive had
escaped. Then themoon started inpursuit. When thehead
chief ssondiscoveredthis,hethrew behind them thedevil sclub
hehadreceived from theoldwoman, andapatchofdevil sclub
arose which themoon hadsomuch trouble ingetting through that
theygained rapidly onhim.When themoon again approached, the
head chief ssonthrew back therosebushes, andsuch athicket of
roses grewthere that themoon wasagain delayed. When heap
proached them once more, theythrew back thegrindstone, and it
became ahighclifffrom which themoon kept rolling back. Itis
onaccount ofthis cliffthatpeople cansaythings about themoon
nowadays withimpunity. When theboys reached theoldwoman s
house theywere very gladtoseeeach other, forbefore thisthey
hadnothadtime tospeak.
The oldwoman gavethem somethingtoeat,and,whenthey

Then theboyvaulted inthere, andthey started off.
After theyhadgone alonginthismanner forsome time, theboy,

Then thebigmanstopped and lethimdown, andheshot thebird
with anarrow andputitinto hisbosom, afterwhich hecrawled
back intothebigman sshirt. Butnow thisbirdhadincreased the

there forseveral days, living onbeaver meat anddryingtheskins.
Butthefirsteveningthegiant said, Keepalook out. Ifyouhear

After thistheboyscompanion hadnothingtofear,andwandered

Oneevening, however, theboybegan thinkingofhisfather and

outuntil thewater reached herhips. Then shesuddenlyfeltsome

After that GAinna/tck!i feltvery badly andthoughttohimself,uHowcanIgetmywifeback? Howcan Ilook forherunder the

thought,&quot;Iwonder ifIcouldn traise thiswater soastogounder it.&quot;
Inthemorning, therefore, before hehadeaten hetook hisredand

farther andfarther. Itwasjustlikewalking onland.
Byandbyhecame toavillagefull ofvery pale people who
went about with their heads down. Hefound outthattheywere
thered-cod people. Hewanted tomake friends ofthem, so,think
ingthat they looked very white, hepainted them allredmen,
women, and children. That ishow these fishesgottheir color.
After thatheasked them iftheyhadseen hiswife, butthey said
thattheyhadseennoone, sohewent on. Presently hecame to
anothervillage andasked thepeoplethere thesamequestionto
which hereceived theverysame answer. Those were thehalibut
people. Ineachvillage theygavehimsomethingtoeat.
After hehad leftthehalibut people GAmna tckli traveled for
several daysbefore hecame toanother town. Byandby,however, he
perceived smoke farahead ofhim,and,going towardit,hesawthat it
wasfrom afort. Inside ofthis fortwasalarge house which he
immediately entered, butthepeoplethere didnotseem tocare to

been jealousofthekiller whales because theyhad thiswoman.
While theshark people weretelling himwhat todo,astrange, bony-
looking person keptjumping upfrom behind theboxes. Hewon
dered whatmadehimactsoqueerly andbegantofeeluneasy about

Just after thattheman started forthekiller-whale townandsat

After thathetookGAmna tckli tothedoorandshowed himwhere

Then, when theslave thought thathehadgottenalong distance

Assoon ashegotthere, thesharkpeople begantodress themselves
forwar. They werenoisy andacted asthough they were very

came tohim,however, andtoldhimnottobefrightened, because
the killer whales were coming over. Allatonce thefortbegan

thefort killed thembymoving upanddown andcuttingofftheir

frightened andwent back. Two orthree days later thekiller whales
came again with like result.

AtKlawak wasaman oftheGanAxA dinamed Dancer (iJexe)
whowasvery fond ofgambling butunable towin. Finallyhis
wife said,&quot;Ifyougamble againwewillleave each other. Idon t

husband saidthathewouldstop, and foralittle while hedid so.
Oneday,however, agreatgamewasinprogressfaroutonthemarsh,

thathadwon their property came afterit,andDancer gotupand
showed them where thethings were, buthiswife didnotspeaka

Finally,aftertheywere gone, thewoman satdown andbegantocry.
When shewasthrough shesaid tohim,&quot;The house belongedtoyou,
butyoumust goout,foryouhavegambled with allofmythings.

andtheywillnottakemeinifIleave here.&quot; Then herhusband
said,uDonotfeelbadlyifyoushould happentohear ofme,&quot;andhe
went away.
Thismanhadseven sisters,allofthem verywelloff,butthey
would nothaveanythingtodowithhim. Very earlyinthemorning
hewent totheir houses andawakened theboys. Without asking
thepermissionoftheirmothers hetoldthem togettheirbows and
arrows quicklyandcome along with him. Next morning, after he
hadwalked withthem forsome distance, theyfound acanoe, andhe
hadthem allgetinto it.Intheevening, when their unclecamped
withthem, thechildren begantofeelthatsomething waswrong, and
some cried, sayingthattheywanted togetback totheir fathers and
mothers. Then hetoldthem thattheywould sooncome toafine
town, andkeptongoingfarther andfarther awayuntil theyreached
aplacecalled Sea-lion s-face(Tan-yeda )where Tongass nowstands.
They keptonbeyondthisuntil theycame toalarge rocksome dis
tance outatseaonwhich were seaotters; these they clubbed.
Some oftheboyswerenowquite large. Later theycame toalong
sandy beach, and their unclemade ahouse there outofdriftwood.
Hedried theskinsandmade thatplacehispermanentresidence.
Duringthesecond night they spent there, Dancer heard thetwo
dogshehadbrought along, barking. Hetold hissisters children to
getoutofbed toseewhatwasthematter. Theydidso,and,on
running out,discovered alargeanimal coming along,asbigasablack
bear. Atfirsttheythought that itwasabear, but itwasofadiffer

shot atit,andtheman picked uptheir arrows andnoticed that
there wassomethinglikeclayupon them. Everyone pursued the
animal andatlasttheysaw itdisappearintoahole inamountain.
Meanwhile Dancer took theclayey substance from allofthearrows,
wrappeditinleaves, andputitintothebosom ofhisshirt, giving
thearrows back totheboys.
Now, Dancer made theplacehistown, andcontinued tolivethere
with hisnephews whoweregrown up.The stuffhehadtaken from
their arrows heputbehind thebarbs ofothers sothattheycould use
them inhunting. Healsoputsome ofitontheir eyebrows,their
hair,andaround their mouths. Hesaid itwas tomake thehair
thick inthoseplaces, andsureenough theycame tohave fineeye
brows, hair,andmustaches. Theybecamefine-looking men.
When theywent outhunting with themedicine arrows hehad
made, andshot ataseal,even ifthearrow merely came close tothe
sealwithout touching it,thesealwrould die.Thatwas alsoagreat
placeforsealions, andwhenevertheysawoneofthose animals, their

camerightuponthebeach, andthey clubbed ittodeath. They
had allkinds offood intheir house andwerecontinually drying
meatandskins. Thehouse became sofull, infact, thattheyhadto
build alarger one.
Byandbytheiruncle saidthathewanted someeagles, andtheboys,
ofwhom therewere eleven, went outwith theirbowsandarrows, and
eachbrought one in.Then each ofthemhadaneaglestailfanfor
himself such aswere formerly used indancing. Theyalso killed all
kinds ofbirdsandsecured plentyofmarten skinsandweasel skins.
Ofthese latter theuncle sewed together amarten-skin robeanda
weasel-skin shirt foreachboyaswell asoneforhimself.
OnetimeDancer and hisnephews went along distance beyond
their village andfound abox, beautifully carved andpainted, lying
uponthebeach. They said tooneanother,&quot;There must bepeople
living over thisway/ Atthattime theydidnotkn^w anything
about theTsimshian. Keeping onfarther, theysaw stillmore signs
ofpeople, andfinally theycame toaTsimshian town.
Then they returned totheirownplace, andafterward theuncle
feltthatsomepeoplewhom theyknew werecomingtoseethem.
Thesepeople were hisbrothers-in-law, whohadbeenhuntingforhim
continually andhadjuststarted outoncemore. When their canoe
came insight,Dancersaid,&quot;There isacanoe coming right along there
inthedirection wecame from.&quot; Hehadcomposed some songs while
hewas there,sohesaid,&quot;You boysmust dress yourselvestodance
forthepeopleinthat canoe.&quot; When thecanoe gotcloser hewent
outside andshouted,&quot;That canoe must stayoutthere. Don tcome
inright away.&quot; Sothecanoe stopped, and after awhile theboys
came outanddanced forthecanoe people while hesang. Themen
inthecanoe recognized Dancer butnottheboys,whohadgrown up
veryquicklyintofine-looking men. After thattheyinvited thecanoe
people uptothehouse. They entered, and allthetime theywere
there kept looking atoneanother andwhispering, wondering what
Dancer haddone with their children. But, though theycamped
there onenight, they didnotaskforthem.
Next morning, however, just before they gotinto their canoe,
Dancer said toeachman inturn,&quot;This isyour boy. This isyour
boy.&quot;
Upon that hisbrothers-in-law said tohim,&quot;We willberightback
toseeyouagain. Wewillcomeandlivewithyou.&quot; Then theywent
back totheirvillage, andtoldthenews, andthemothers, whohad
beenmourningfortheir children, feltveryhappytoknow thatthey
were alive. Dancer ssisters, their husbands, and alltheirpeople
came over tohim. Dancer and hisnephews hadbeenwatchingfor

Then thepeoplewere asked tocome inand eat,andtheywere all

Next thechief oftheTlhittanmight speakasfollows:
&quot;Down intheTsimshian countrylived ayoung high-caste woman
whowascaptured byadevilfish. Thepeople discovered thatshewas
lost, and-finally theybegan huntingforher,buttheycould findher
nowhere. After theyhadgivenuplooking forhertheysawsomeyoung
devilfish coming uponthedoorstep. They werethrown down from
thereuponthebeach. Afterward theycame back again. Thenthey
leftthem alone, andtheyclimbed upintothechief slap.From this
circumstance hefound outwhathadhappened. Hesaid,cMydaughter
must havebeencaptured bythedevilfish. Then hegavefood tothe
devilfishes. When theywentaway thefood leftoverwascarried down
afterthemandthetra}^swere setdown bythedevilfish rock. When he
found outthat hisdaughter wasunder thatrock, hefeltveryhappy.a
&quot;So itwaswithyou,myson. Itwasasifyouhadbeen captured
bythedevilfishes. Therefore, theseyourfather speople havecome
down toaskyoutopartakeoffoodwiththemfrom under thatrock.
That ishowyourfather speople have gotten younow. Therefore
theyhave taken theclothes offofyouthathavebeenwetbythesea
water andwhich youcannotyourselfsee. Itwassowith thatwoman.
Shecould notseethatherclothes were inthatcondition. Just soyou
arenowgoingtobegiven clothing from these skins thatbelongedto
your father speople. Theywillmake agreatfiretowarm yououtof
everything your fathers people have claimed.
This isthewayithasbeenwithyou. Thewayyour uncles were
taken away from youwasjust asthough youhadbeencaptured by

becomfortable. Aayua(Thisisso).&quot;

Then heheard thevoice ofhisStrength. While hewas inbathinga

wasthrown down. After hehadbeenthrown down, Strengthsaid
tohim,Goagainintothewater andbathe. Iwillcome toyouonce
more. Heheard thevoice asecond time, andwent ashore, andthey
again wrestled. Then Duktu L!almost threwStrength down. So
Strength said, That isenough. You arealready sufficiently strong.
Then hewent up,pulled thelimb outandtwisted thetreetotheroots.
Afterward heputthelimb back anduntwisted thetree.Now he
wentaway andmade thepeople whohadbeen soproud, ashamed of
themselves. Thispoorman,DuktuL!,came tobeabove theproud
