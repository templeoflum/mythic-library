There hefound achiefnamed Aya yi,whohadmarried thedaughter
ofanother chiefbywhom hehadfivechildren, fourboysandagirl.
Hiswifewasalways making baskets, whileAya/yi himself went out
campingortoothervillages. Hehadalongboxthathetookabout

each familytattooed thehands insomespecial way. One time,
when thechief swifewassitting under thisboxadropofblood fell

boxdown andlooked into it.Itwas fullofsevered hands, andby
thetattoo marks sheknew thattheybelongedtoheruncles. She
wasveryfond ofheruncles andcried continuallyforthem.
After herhusband hadfound herweepingseveral times heasked,
&quot;What areyoualways cryingabout?&quot; andshesaid,&quot;Iamgetting
tired oflivinghere. Iwant togoback tomyfather and mother.&quot;
Then hesaid,uWewillstartback toyourfather splaceto-morrow.&quot;
Sonextdayhecarried herandherchildren toaplace notfarfrom
herfather stownand letthem offtheretelling them towalk across.
Then hepaddled home.
Even before shestarted across,hiswifenoticed that therewasa
heavy fogoverherfather svillage, andwhen shegotthere shefound
itvacant. There wasnothinginitbutdead bodies, andshewent
from house tohouse weeping. Now after herchildren hadthought
over thismatter forawhile, they skinned some ofthebodies and
made acanoe outofthem. Itwasthe first oftheskin canoes. It
was allonaccount ofAyayihaving murdered thepeopleofthat
town. Theytiedthoseplaces onthecanoe thathad tobemade
tight, withhuman hair. Afterward theytook itdown tothewater
andputitin,making akind ofsingingnoise astheywent. Nowadays
these canoes aremade ofallkinds ofskins, butthehairused isalways
human hairandthey singinthesamemanner when theyputthem
intothewater. Theyalsomade adrum outofhuman skin.
After that allgotintothecanoe, andtheystarted fortheir father s
town, singingastheywent, while, theirmother steered. When they
came infront ofitthepeople said,&quot;There isacanoe coming. Wecan
hearsinginginit,and inthesong theyarementioning Ayayis
name.&quot; Thatwas allthey could hear. Thewhole towncame out
tolook atthecanoe. Then theeldest sonarose inthecanoe, men
tioned hisfather sname, andsaid,&quot;Givememyuncle shands. If
youdonotgivethem tomeIwillturn thistown ofyours upside

thetown begantosink. Itshook asifthere were anearthquake.
Now thepeopleofthetown becamefrightened. They went to

After theyhadreached theirownvillage Raven said totheeldest
boy,&quot;Getsome eaglefeathers andputthem onthemouths ofyour
uncles and alltheother townpeople. After youhaveplaced them
there blow them away again. Put their hands intheirproper
places, andputfeathers over thecuts. Assoon asyouhaveblown

didso,and allthedead people came tolife.

OnedayRaven sawawhale faroutatseaandsatdown onthe

hedidcutthewhale sheart outandkilledit,afterwhich itbegan

voices ofchildren. These children heard hisvoice, wenthome and
informed theirparents. Then thepeopleallcame there andcutthe

Raven stayed upinthewoods along time inorder togetthe
grease andsmell offofhisfeathers, and,when hecamedown again,
hesawboxes andboxes ofwhale grease.Then hemade believe he

Then allofthepeoplebelieved himand lefttheir oilthere. Itbecame

NextRaven went toaplace where many sealions, seals, and
porpoises were lying about. Amongthese there were anumber of
achildren, who cutpiecesoffatfrom theanimals andthrew them
backand forth. Sohemade himself look likeachild and,when
they threw him apieceoffat,heate it.Finallythechildren
missed their fatand said,&quot;What isbecomingofallthe fatwe
were playing with? Itisalldisappearing.&quot;6
ThenRaven came toalarge town where everyone appearedto
have died. Heentered thelargest house, andsawnooneinside,
yethecould feelaperson continually pushing against him. Itwas
aghost house, and thetown was called theTown ofGhosts
(Qayahayiani)-Afterward Raven loaded acanoe withprovisions
from theghostshouses andstarted topaddle away, buthedidnot
notice that avery longlinewasfastened tothestern ofthecanoe
andsecured attheother endround atree.When hereached the
end ofthisropethecanoe waspulled rightback tothebeach, and
thegoods were allcarried uptothehouse byinvisible hands. One

NextRaven wentamongtheAthapascanIndians oftheinterior

Inthemorningthecannibal bathed. After that thetwobecame
verygood friends, andthecannibal said toRaven,&quot;Iamgoing
hunting, and Iamgoingtogetfour animals, twomountain goats
andtwoground hogs.&quot; Sothecannibal took ahideropesuch as
theinterior Indians used tomake andstarted. OnthewayRaven
said tothecannibal,&quot;Where isthatman called TsAmaya?&quot; He

wasanother very powerful man. And thecannibal showed him
where TsAmayalived.
ThenRaven stayed withTsAmaya, andtheybecame good friends
also. The latter lived allbyhimself atthattime,allofhisfriends
having been killed byWolverine-man(NusgA-qa/). Sohesaid to
Raven,&quot;Idonotknow what todowith him. Iwould like tokill
him.&quot; AndRaven said tohim,uDoyou seethisspear? Goand
getabear skinandputitaroundyourself. Putthespearinsuch
apositionastomakehimbelieve hehaskilled abear.&quot; TsAmaya did
so,andbyandbyWolverine-man camealong. Hewasvery glad
when hesawthebearandsaid,&quot;Ihave another.&quot; Then hepicked
thebearup,tookoutthespear andcarried ithome. After thathe
went togather wood. While hewasgoneRaven made himself
appearlikeacommon blackbird andinthatform said toTsAmaya,
&quot;Wolverine-man sheart isinhis foot.&quot; Then hetook the little
spear hehadconcealed inhislong hairandgaveittoTsAmaya,
whospeared Wolverine-man inthefoot assoon ashecame in.He
washurtbadly butranaway from them. When they caught up
withhimand toldhimtheywere goingtokillhim, hesaid,&quot;All

finally theyburned him. Then, when theywereabout topulverize
hisbones, thebones spoke upand said tothem,&quot;Pulverize my
bones andblowthem away. Theywillalways beabother toyou
andeverybodyelse. Ishall always remain inthe world.&quot; That is
where themosquitoes andgnatscome from.a
Afterward Raven came towhere ahouse wasfloatingfaroutat
sea,called K!udatAn kahi ti.Nas-cAki-yeJ hadbeen keepingit
there, and initwere allkinds offishes, butRaven didnotknow
how togetatthem. Atthesameplace healsometamonster,
called QlaiiAxgadayiye(which seems tomeanuathing that isin
theway&quot;), whohadaspearlikethearm ofadevilfishcalled,&quot;devil

themonster sdaughter. Then hegotinto acanoe, paddled out
near thehouse, andspearedit.Inside heheard allkinds ofsongs
sungbydifferent voices. These were thesongs people were tosing
inthefishingseason. When Raven threw hisspear,itbecame very
longandwrappeditself around thehouse sofirmlythathewas
enabled totake hiscanoe ashore. Hehadgreat difficulty, however,
forashedidsohehad tosingcontinually,&quot;Ithinkso,Ithinkso,&quot;
asongknown toalloftheRavenpeople. Whenever hestopped
singing,thehouse went back totheplacewhere ithadbeen atfirst.
Thishappenedthree times andthefourth timehegotitin.
a&quot;This episodeisreferred towhen aperson takes afterabadfather. They saytohim,Whydo
youtake afteryour father? Everybody knows thatyouarehischild. Can tyoutakeanother road

After that thedoor ofthehouse opened, and allkinds offish

Chilkat river/ which theyimmediatelydid.Then hesang again,
&quot;Some gotothesmall creeks toprovide thepoor people.&quot; That
ishow fishcame tobeallover theworld.
NowRaven went farther andcame toawoman andalittlegirl
allalone. Shewascrying andRaven asked her,&quot;What areyou
cryingabout?&quot; &quot;Ihave lost allofmyfriends. Iamallalone here
withmylittlegirl. Thepeople keptgoingoffhuntingorfishing and
never come back. What hashappenedtothem Idonot know.&quot;
ThenRaven said tothegirl,&quot;Doyouknow thething withwhich
theymake fire?&quot; Shesaid&quot;No,&quot;fortheyhadkepttheir fires all
nightsince theother people were gone. ThenRaven showed her
how tomake firewith the fire drill. Hesaid,&quot;Drill awayuntil
yougetalotofthisfine stuff. Then takesomeandeat it.&quot;
After thegirlhaddone thisshebecame pregnant andgavebirth
toamale childwhom theycalled Fire-drill sson(Tuli-yA di).Then
Raven said toher,&quot;There isacoldspring back here. Bathe your
little oneinitevery day,andhewillgrowupveryfast.&quot; Tothis
day theycall thatspring Water -that-makes -one-grow. The
woman bathed him asdirected andhesoongrewupinto aman

&quot;Mother,isthisthewayyouhave always been? Didn tyouhave

been thisway.&quot; Hewas sobrightthat shewould not tellhim.
Then thechildwentonasking,&quot;Whose houses arethose? Ithink

Sohisgrandmother finallytoldhimwhathadhappened.
Thisboywasagoodshotwith arrows, buthesaid,&quot;What canI
do? Allthecanoeslyinghere areoldand broken.&quot; Inthenight,
however, hisfather, Fire-drill, appearedtohiminadream andsaid,
&quot;Take oneofthose oldcanoes upintothewoods andcover itwith

One oftheboysarrows wasnamedHeart-stopper (Teq!-gots) ;
because apersonsheart stopped beatingtheinstant ittouched his

One ofthewolf chiefs thoughtagreatdeal ofFire-drill sson.
Onetime thewolves began talking about allthosethingsthatcan

Then thewolves allwentupandbrought down thedeadgoats, and
theyfeltverymuch ashamed thatthey,whowerenoted runners and
hunters, hadgotten nothing. Theywondered what they could do
togeteven with Fire-drill sson.Thenthey took aquantityof

Fire-drill ssonswolf friend said tohim, however, &quot;My friend,

answered, No, Iwillnotplaywiththem, but letuswatch them.&quot;

&quot;It isalsobrought uptothepeople how Fire-drill ssonfedtheyoung hawks instead ofkilling them.
Ifayoung personisvery cruel they saytohim, Ifthehawk canbemade afriend ofmankind, why

Healsoused the&quot;Blarneystone&quot; asagrindstone, andkilled some
ofhischildren byrubbingtheir facesuponit.
Hiswifemourned verymuch forherchildren, andfinally thought
ofaway ofbeing revenged upon him. Shehadalitter ofpuppies
bythedog. There wereoriginally twelve, butsevendied, leav
ingfourmale puppies andonefemale. These puppies grewupvery
fast.While themanandhiswifewereaway fishing anddigging clams
thepuppies played about thehouse, andthenoise theymade sound
edjustlikethat ofchildren. Butthefemale always watched atthe
door, andwhen theirmother ranuptostopthem allwould belying
about onthefloor asleep. They kept gettingnoisier andnoisier,
andsounded moreandmore likehumanbeings. Finally LAkitcine
heard itandsaid tohiswife :Who arethesemakingsomuch noise
here?&quot; &quot;It isthosedogs.&quot; Then shethought very seriously what
sheshould dowith thepuppies. Thenexttime LAkitcine wasout
heheard them stillmoreplainly, andnowhethought thatheheard
human voices. Hecame ashore ingreat anger andsaid tohiswife:
&quot;It isnotthose dogsthat Iheartalking.&quot; Hewas sodangerous
aman that hiswifewasverymuchfrightened.
After that sheformed aplan. So,when herhusband went out
halibut fishing thenext time, shestuck herdigging stick intothe
ground, putherblanket aroundit,andherhatupon theend. Then
sheranupthrough thewoods andhidherself, while the littledogwas
watching LAkitcine .After thatshecreptback tothehouse, which
wasmade ofbrush, andinwhich theywere againmakingagreat deal
ofnoise. Looking inside, shefound that theboyswere allplaying
about inhuman forms, theirdogskinslyingashort distance away
from them. Then shequickly raninupon them, exclaiming,&quot;You
must liketobedogssinceyouweardog skins,&quot; grabbed theskinsand
threw them intothe fire. The little dogthat satoutside wasthe
onlyonethatremained initsoriginal form.
Now,when LAkitcine came ashore, andsawthechildren, hewas
angry and feltverymuch ashamed athaving been outwitted. He
didnotknowhow tokillthem, forhethought theyhadmorepower
than he.One,named KAckULk!,wasashaman. Hehadhisgrand
father andtheone-eyed manand hiswifethat hisgrandfather had
killed ashisspirits. LAkitcine thought thathewould firstquarrel
with hiswife, and,when hecame intothehouse, hebegan tothrow
andkickthings about. But,when hebegan tobeat hiswife, the
children jumped uponhimandfought with him. Theyalsoasked
thedogtohelpthem. Together theykilled him.
After these boys weregrown up,theirmother toldthemmany

Iwill tellyouthismuch, that neither TsAgwa nnormyselfwillget
thiswoman. This iswhyTsAgwa nisnowalways alone. Raven
alsosaid tothechief,&quot;You willsoonhearsomething ofthisdaughter
ofyours.&quot;Allthehigh-caste menwanted tomarrythiswoman,
butshewould nothave them.
Going onagain, Raven came toanoldmanliving alone, named
DAmna/dji, andsaid tohim,&quot;Doyouknow theyoung daughterof
thechief closebyhere?&quot;&quot;Yes, Iknow her.&quot;&quot;Why don tyou
trytomarryher?&quot; &quot;Ican tgether. Iknow Icant,soIdon t
want totry.&quot; ThenRaven said,&quot;Iwillmake amedicine toenable
youtogether.&quot; &quot;But Ihave noslave,&quot; said theoldman;&quot;to
getheramanmust have slaves.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; saidRaven, &quot;youdonot
have tohave aslave together. She willtake alikingtoyouand
nobody canhelpit.She willmarry you. Herfather willlosehalf
ofhisproperty.&quot; Then hemade theoldman look young, got
feathers toputinto hishairandamarten-skin robe toputoverhim
sothatheappeared veryhandsome. ButRaven said tohim,&quot;You
arenotgoingtolook like this allofthetime. Itisonlyforaday
or so.&quot;
After thistherejuvenated man gotinto hisskin canoe,forthis
was well tothenorth, andpaddled over towhere thegirllived.
Hedidnotaskherfather sconsent butwentdirectlytoher,andshe
immediatelyfellinlovewith him. Althoughsomany hadbeen
after hershenow said,&quot;Iwillmarry you.Iwillgowithyoueven
ifmyfather killsmefor it.&quot;
When thechief sslaves found them inthebedroom attherear of
thehouse, they said tothechief,&quot;Your daughterismarried.&quot; So
hermother looked inthere andfound itwas true. Then herfather
said,&quot;Come outfrom thatroom,my daughter.&quot; Hehadalready
told hisslaves tolaydown valuable fursonthefloor forhisdaughter
andherhusband tositon.Hethoughtifshewere already married
itwasofnouseforhim tobeangry with her. Sothegirlcame out
with herhusband, and,when herfather sawhimhewasvery glad,
forheliked hislooks, andhewasdressed likeahigh-caste person.
Then thechief related tohisson-in-law how afellow came along
wanting tomarryhisdaughter, andhowTsAgwa nhadcome after
ward and toldhimthathehadbeen cruel tohisfirst wife. Said

the chief,&quot;Thismanhadawife. His first wife isliving yet. I
don twant tohurt hiswife sfeelings.&quot;
After that hisson-in-law said, &quot;Myfather toldmetostart right
outafterhimto-dayinmycanoe.&quot; Hewas inahurrytodepart
because hewasafraid that allofhisgood clothing would leave him.
Hesaid tohiswife,&quot;Take onlyyourblanket touseonthepassage,
because Ihaveplentyoffurs ofevery descriptionathome.&quot; So
shetooknothing buthermarten-skin robeandafoxrobe.
Asshelayinthecanoe, however, with herhead resting onhislap
shekept feeling dropsofwater fallupon herface,andshesaidmany
times,&quot;What isthat dripping onmyface?&quot; Then hewouldsay,
&quot;Itmust bethewater splashing frommy paddle,&quot; but itwasreally
thedrippings that fallfromanoldman seyeswhen heisvery filthy.
Herhusband hadalready become anoldman again andhad lost
hisfineclothing, butshecould notsee itbecause herfacewasturned
theother way.When thewoman thought thattheywere nearly
attheir destination sheraised herself tolookout,glancedather
husband sface,andsawthathewasanaltogether different man.
Shecried veryhard.
After theyhadarrived athistown theoldmanwentfrom house
tohouse asking thepeopletotakepityonhimand lethimbring
hiswife tooneofthem, because heknew that hisownhouse was
not fitforher. These, however, weresome ofthepeoplethathad
wanted tomarrythiswoman,sothey said, &quot;Why don tyoutake
hertoyourown finehouse? Youwanted her.&quot; Meanwhile shesat
onthebeach bythecanoe, weeping. Finally theshabbysister of
thisoldman,whowas stillolder thanhe,camedown toherand
said,&quot;See here, you areahigh-castegirl. Everybody saysthis
man isyour husband, andyouknow heisyour husband, soyou
better come uptothehouse with me.&quot; Then shesaw theplace
where helived, andobserved that hisbedwasworse than that of
oneofherfather sslaves. Theotherpeoplealsopaidnoattention
toher,although theyknewwhoshewas,because shehadmarried
thisman. They would eataftereverybodyelsewasthrough, and,
while hewaseating, thepeopleofthetownwould make funofhim
byshouting out,&quot;DAmnadjisfather-in-law andhisbrothers-in-law
arecoming tohisgrand house tosee him.&quot; Then hewould runout
toseewhether itwere soandfindthattheyweremaking funofhim.
Every morning, while hewasbreakfasting with hiswife, thepeople
fooled him inthisway.
Although hehadnotsaidso,thefather-in-law andthebrothers-
in-law ofDAmna/dji thought thathewas avery high-caste person
because hewasdressed sofinely. Sothey gottogetheralltheir

Then theoldmanbeggedtheboystocarryupthestrangers goods,

atoncewhatwasthematter and feltvery sorryforthese oldpeople.
After that theoldmankept sayingtotheboyswhocame into

Sohebecame veryrichandwas chief ofthattown. That iswhy

Raven went toanother place andturned himself intoawoman.
Then shethoughtwithin herself,&quot;Whose daughtershall IsayIam?&quot;
Shesawaseagull sitting outonahighrockandthought shewould
callthatherfather. Years agoachiefwould always pickoutahigh
placeinthevillage onwhich tositinthemorning, andwhenRaven
sawtheseagullshethoughtwithin herself/ IamTAcAkltuA ns(Sitter-
on-a-high-clifFs) daughter.&quot; Acanoe came alongfilled with killer
whales returningtotheirownvillage, andshemarried oneofthem.
When theygotnear thetown, some oneonthebeach called tothem,
&quot;Where isthatcanoe comingfrom?&quot; andonereplied,&quot;We have
a&quot;AsTsAgwa/n wasamischiefmailerandfollowed Raven totellwhat hehaddone tohiswife, so
someman willalways follow oneupifhedoesn ttellthetruth. Formerly, when aman lefthiswife, a
settlement ofproperty wasmade and,ifamanmarried again before thistook place, hisfirstwifemade
trouble forhissecond. Sincenoonewants trouble ofthiskind, awoman always found outwhat aman
was likebefore shemarried him, justasthiswoman found outabout Raven.
&quot;Since DAmna/dji married awoman ofhigher family than himself andwa.staunted bythetown
people, nowadays they tellayoungman that, ifhemarries agirlofhigher rankthan himself, they will
notremain together long,because shewill feelabove himandwanthimtoplease hercontinually, while
shedoesnothing toplease him. AsDAmna/dji from being poorbecame richsuddenly andwasvery
hardonhispeopletillallofhisriches were again takenaway from him,they say,When you.become
wealthy afterhaving been poor, don tbeproud oryourmoney will allleave you.When amanhas
hadplentyofmoneyallhis lifeandwastes itfoolishly, theysayofhim,Hehasfallen from thehands
ofthebrant Soayoungmannowadays savesupaconsiderable sum ofmoney before hemarries that
hemaynotbemade fun of.Perhapsifwehadnothadthisstoryamong thenatives ofAlaska we
would havehadnothing togoby.
&quot;The factthatDAmna djiswife srelations didnotinsult ormaltreat himafter they learned ho\v
poorhewas,shows thattheywere really high caste. Hadtheybutrecently acquired theirwealth they
would havedone so.Therefore people saytoaperson whospeaks before hethinks, Why can tyoii
belikeDAmnadjisbrothers-in-law? Think before youspeak. When thevillage people weremaking
funoftheir brother-in-law, hiswife srelations might havedoneanything tothem, fortheyhadwealth
infursandslaves, buttheykept quiet because theyhadtoomuch respect fortheir sister todisgrace
herhusband svillage people. Itwasalsooutofrespect fortheir sister that,when theyfound outthat
allthatthepoormanhadforthem todrinkwaswater, theydrank itwillingly without saying aword,
where alow-caste person would have grumbled. Therefore people tellamanwhohasnorespect for
hisbrother-in-law because heislow-caste thatheought tobelikethese brothers-in-law ofDAmna/dji.
Because DAmna djiwaslucky twice, thepeople inolden times used topray forluck continually. If
hewanted tobelucky apoorman lived averypurelife.Thosewhodonotdowhat isright never will

that?&quot; they inquired, because inolden timespeople never went for
anywoman bycanoeexcept thedaughterofachief. &quot;It isTACAkl-
ttUVsdaughter,&quot;saidthey.&quot;ItisCuda xduxo&quot;s (Barked-hemlock s)
daughter.&quot;Allofthekiller whales believed this.
Afterthat, thekiller whales begantonotice that theirfoodwas
disappearing very rapidly, although theywerealways outfishing and
hunting andhadhadtheirhousepiledfullofboxes ofgrease. They
said,&quot;What iswrong? What hasbecome ofallthegrease andfat
inthese boxes?&quot; They could notfindoutforalong time. Raven
wore alabret atthattime setwithabalone shellwhich wasformerly
very valuable, and itisfromhim thathigh-caste people afterward
used these. After some time theyfound thislabret inone ofthe
boxes ofgrease andsaid,&quot;Just look atthislabret in here.&quot; Then
Raven exclaimed,&quot;Ih!mylabret, that isalways thewaywithmy
labret. Whenever itfeels likedoing so,itwillleavemy lipand
gooffanywhere.&quot;
ByandbyRavensaid,lIwonder what iswrong that Ihavesuchbad
dreams. Idreamt that allthepeopleofthisvillage wereasleep, and
myhusband went tosleepandnever wokeup.Mydreams always
come true. Whatever Idreamsurely happens.&quot; Late thenext
night shegotastick, sharpened theends,andkilled herhusband; and
earlyinthemorning theyheard hercrying, &quot;Myhusband, CawA t-
kaLAqdagesfather.&quot; Yearsago,before thewhite lawscame in
force,when achief used these words inhisspeech, people knew that
hehadagrudge against some oneandwasgoingtomurder him. The
killer whales, however, didnotknowwhat shemeant.
ThenRaven toldthepeople thatherhusband hadsaid,&quot;Take me
andplacemequiteadistance from the town.&quot; They didso,andshe
said, &quot;When youhearmecry,Idon twantanyofyoutopass the
place where Iammourning. Tieupthefingersofmyright hand.
Allow metoeatwithmylefthandonly. You people must also
waitupon me.Youmust bringmeeverythingIeat. Alsopaintmy
face black.&quot; Shebeing thewidow, theyhadtodoeverything justasshe
toldthem, andthese aretheregulations people haveobserved uptothe
present time. When theyheard hercrying around thespotwhere
herhusband sbodyhadbeen laid,noonedared gonear,andtothis
daythosewhogobyahouse where peoplearemourning have tobe
very quiet. Nordothey passitatallunless theyarecompelledto.
Raven stayed there mourningforalong time, butshewasreally
eatingthekiller-whale sbody. After shehadremained byitfora
very long time, shewould comehome chewing gum, but,when the
husband srelations asked herforapiece, shewould say, &quot;No,no
onecanchew thisgumbutMaca
,&quot;which wasthename shegaveto
herself.

Shelived there foralongtime, continually crying outofdoors, but
shewasreally cryingforjoybecause sheintended tokillallofthekiller
whales.
While sitting outside onedayakek!u(asmall seagullwithblack
headandwhite body)flewpast,andRaven said,&quot;Here comes theman
Imade white.&quot; Byandbyshesawanother, called kuLleta,also
white, andrepeatedthesame words. Thensome swans came along
farupinthesky,andshesaid thesame thing about them. The
killer whales heard allthisand said,&quot;Since youhavemade them
white, can tyoumake uswhite also?&quot; &quot;Itwillhurtyoutobemade
white,&quot;saidRaven.&quot;Those peoplethatcame along weremade
white because theywere brave.&quot; Then shesharpenedthesame hard
wood stick withwhich shehadkilled herhusband andtold allofthe
killers tolieinarow. Shebegan poundingthisintotheirears,andso
killed allofthembutthelast. Thislooked upintime toseewhat she
wasdoing andrushed intotheseasaying,&quot;Raven hasfinished us
sureenough&quot; (QothagAsiniyel). Raven remained there forsome
time eatingthewhales shehad killed.
Thereason whythere aresomany cowards among mennowadays
isbecause Raven, beingaman,made himself intoawoman atthat
time. Thepeoplethat livesinglealltheir lives aresuch ascamefrom
Raven atthatperiod.This isalsowhythieves aregreattalkers and,
when theyhavegotteninto trouble, have awayofgetting out,and
whysomewomen arebadanddeceive theirhusbands; forRaven said
that hishusband hadwanted tobeburied alongwayfrom town, and
theybelieved him. This iswhytheTlingit used tobeverycareful of
waytheyspoke andeven ofthewaytheywalked when inpublic.a
After thatRaven came toafishhawk (kimackAnye t)andexclaim
ing,&quot;Oh!myfriend.&quot; entered itshouse, where wasagreat quantity
offood. Hefeltveryhappyatthesight, andsaid tothebird,&quot;I
willstaywithyouall winter.&quot; Then hestayedsolong that the
hawk begantogettired ofhim, because Raven would notwork.
When hesawthat thebirdwasgetting wearyofhimhewouldsay,
&quot;The time formetowork hasn tcomeyet.When Iworkyouwill
have plentyofrest.You willnothave todoathing. Thisbeach
aThispart ofthestorywasreferred towhen onewished toimply thataperson wastrying tomake
people believe thathewasbetter thanhereally was. Sonowadays, when ahigh-caste manwants to
marry anorphan, people findoutwhoherfather is,because Raven made believe herownfather wasa
chief. Somewomen willgoofftoastrange placeandsayfalsely, Iamso-and-so sdaughter/ making
people think that shebelongs toaveryhigh family. Thesame sort ofwoman willassume mourning
forherhusband, andmake people believe sheismourning when sheisreally thinking what sheisgoing
todoandwhere sheisgoing. Ifshefindsoutshecangetherliving falsely, shewillkeeponbeing false.
That iswhyRaven told somany stories about herhusband sdeath. When amother seesthather
girlisvery foolish, shewillsaytoher,When youmarry andbecome awidow, you willeatupyour
husband sbody, meaning that,ifherhusband leaves heranyproperty, shewilluse itupfoolishly.
Shealsosays toher,Youaresofoolish now, Ibelieve you willsteal afteryouaremarried, meaning
thatshewillbefoolish withwhat herhusband earns. Then, shesays, They willfindyououtbyfind
ingsomething ofyours intheplacewhere youhave been,and itwillbeadisgracetoyour brothers and
your father.&quot;(From thewriter sinformant.)

forhim, forget everything else,andwork alltheharder tosupplyhimwith food whileRavenstayedinthehouse. Raven would also
talk tohim, saying,&quot;Iremember tohave seenyoulong ago.You
were very high-caste.Iremember itverywell.&quot; Inthatwayhe
made thehawkforgetforatime allthebadfeelings hehadhad
toward him. Butfinallythe littlehawk determined togoaway, and
heleftRaven there alone.a
ThenRaven went toanother industrious bird, calledhinyikle xi,

After thatRaven came tothegoose people, andmarried awoman

forother countries. Idon tthinkyoucanstand thejourney.&quot; Oh !
yes,&quot;saidRaven,&quot;Ithink Icanstand thejourney.Ifyoucan,I
can.&quot; Sotheysetout,and,whenRaven becametired, hiswife flew
along under him toholdhimup. Finally theycame tocamp and
began going outonthebeaches todigroots. Raven helped them,

Raven went toanotherplace, andtheysaid tohim,&quot;There will

Thepeople whogavethiswere oftheWolf clan,sohedanced with
oneofthetwoRavenparties. Afterward hemade along speech
tothehost. Then theydanced again, andRaven held aspearin
hishands. Thismeant thathewasgoingtoinvite toafeast next,
andwasdone that theymight givehimmore than theothers. So
nowadays some areinearnest indoingthiswhile others gothrough
theperformance andleave without keepingitinmind. Raven was
theperson who firsthadthose dances andspeeches.
aThis isthewaynowadays withpersons whohavenorespect forthemselves. They gofromhouse
tohouse tobefedbyothers, andsuchpersons aregreedy, great eaters, andlazy. Thepeopletelltheir
children thatthosewholead thiskind oflifearenotrespected. Aperson who tellsthetruth isalways

slightest attention tohim. ThenRaven made hisslave askagain,
&quot;Where shall this chief sit?Where shall thischief sit?&quot; andagain
theypaidnoattention, although heshouted sothat allinthehouse
could hearhim.When thepeoplelefthewas stillstanding around,
sohisslaves said tohim, &quot;Why wereyousoparticular? Wecould
havehadagreatdeal to eat.&quot; After allweregoneRaven atethe
leavings.
Sonowadays, when aperson wants more thananyoneelseand
makes people send forhimagain andagain, they goonwith the
feast, lestthose oftheopposite partythink that thehost caresmore
forthisoneperson than foralltherestofthem andleave hishouse.
That iswhythey paidnoattention toRaven when hedidcome.
Onereason whyRaven stayed away wasthathethought hewould
make themcome afterhimseveral times because hehadpromised
togiveafeast inreturn. Nowadays aperson who isgoingtogive a
feast acts inthesame way,andpeople knowbyitwhat heintends.
Thefollowing winter Raven gavehisfeast. Thiswas atAlsek
river, andyoucan still seehishouse there with theboxes inside [a
rockhollowed outlikeacavewith other rocks inside ofit].When
theycame insightofthattheIndians would praytoit.
Assoon ashisguests came, Raven wentdown tomeetthem with
hisbowandarrows. That iswhy people nowgodown with their
guns. Hehadsomuchrespectforhisguests thathehad allofhis
relations actasservants, washingtheirhands andwaitingonthem
while theyate. Therefore thenatives now actjustsowhen they
invitepeople from other towns. Raven taught that allwhocame
aftershould dojustashehaddone. Healsoprepared chewing tobacco
forhisguests.
Then hebegan buildinghishouse, and,when theframe, consisting
offouruprights andtwocross-pieces, wascompleted, heand his
friends danced the first dance. Inthisdance people singfuneral
songs. Eight songs,oronesongwitheight verses, areused atthis

time, followingacertain regular sequence and,ifonethat does not
know thesongstarts itandbegins with thewrong verse,itislooked
onasadisgracetohispeople. Theguests danced, wearingtheir
masks, hats,emblem coats, andother festalparaphernalia. After
thathedistributed hisproperty,thepeoplethathadinvited him
before andtheleading chiefs obtaining most ofit.a
After thisRaven returned totheplace where hewasbornand
found theboxwhich hadheld thesun,moon, andstars, andwhich
nowcontained hismother,stillhanging upinthehouse ofNas-cA kl-
yel.Then hewent outwith hisbowandarrows andshot awhale
(ya l). Itfloated ashore onthebeach andevery dayhesaw all
kinds ofseabirds sitting upon it,buthedidnotlikethelooks ofany
ofthem.Finally, however, heshot abird called caxandalarge
birdwhich wasvery pretty andhadabillthatlooked likecopper.
Then hewent toNas-cA ki-yeTs house, tookdown theboxwhich
contained hismother,6andliberated theflickers (kun) which she
always kept under herarms. When Nas-cA ki-yel saw that, he
said,UA11those pretty thingsofmine aregone.&quot; Theyknew that
Raven haddonethis, sotheycalled him into thehouse, andNas-
CAki-yel asked him ifitwasindeed he.Hesaid,&quot;Yes.&quot; Then
Nas-cAki-yel said,&quot;Goand fellthat treestanding overthere,&quot;for
hewanted thetreetokillhim. Butwhen thetree felluponRaven
itcould not killhimbecause hewasmade ofrock. Finding him still
alive, Nas-c Aki-yelcalled him inthefollowing dayand said,&quot;Go
andclean outthat canoe.&quot; Itwasacanoejustbeing made, and
when Raven gotinto ittoclean itout itclosed uponhim. Then he
simply extended hiselbows andbroke thecanoe after which he
smashed itupforfirewood. AllthisNas-cA ki-yel saw,andagain
sent forhim.Hecamein,andtheyputintothefirealarge copper

out.
NowNas-cAki-ye} wasveryangry andsaid,&quot;Let rainpourdown
allovertheworld, and letpeopledieofstarvation.&quot; Then itbecame
sowetandstormythatpeoplecould notgetfoodandbeganto
starve. Their canoes were alsobrokenup,their houses fellinon
them, andtheysufferedterribly. NowNas-cAki-yel: asked forhis
jointed dance hatandwhen heputiton,water began pouring out
ofthevery topofit. Itisfrom Nas-cAki-yel: that theIndians
obtained thiskind ofhat.When thewater rose soastocover the
housefloor, Raven and hismother gotuponthelowestretaining
timber. This house wearetalking of,althoughitlooked likea
house tothem, wasreally partoftheworld. Ithadeight rows of
retaining timbers, and,asthewater cameup,Raven andhismother
climbed toahigherone.Atthesame time thepeopleoftheworld
were climbing upintothe hills.When thewaters reached thefourth
retaining timber theywere halfwayupthemountains. When the
house wasnearlyfullofwater, Raven had hismothergetintothe
skin ofthecaxhehadkilled, while hegotintotheskin ofthewhite
birdwithcopper-colored bill,and tothisverydayTlingit donot
eatthecaxbecause itwasRaven smother. The cax,which isa
great diver,nowstayed onthesurface ofthewater, butRaven him
selfflew tothevery highest cloud intheskvandhungtherebyhis

After Raven hadhungtothiscloud fordaysanddays, nobody
knows howlong, hepulledhis billoutandprayedtofallupon a
pieceofkelp,forhethought that thewater hadgone down. He
didso,and, flying off,found thewatersjusthalfwaydown the
mountains.
Then hetraveled along again andcame toashark which hada
longstick ithadbeenswimming around with. Hetookthis,stuck
itstraight down into theseaandused itasaladder onwhich to
descend under theocean. Arrived atthebottom, hegathered up
some seaurchins andstarted along withthem.
ByandbyRaven came toaplace where anoldwoman livedand
said toher,&quot;How cold Iamaftereating those seaurchins.7Asshe

aAshort version ofthispart ofthestorywasrelated tomebymySitka interpreter whohadobtained

gettoherandmarry her,butheguarded hervery closely. Finally amanreached herandpulled aside
herarms, letting free allofthelandanimals andseacreatures shehadbeenkeeping there. Thatwas
whyherhusband wassojealous about her. Afterward thehusband raised aflood, butonemanheard

wasthelowest tidethatthere everwas. Allkinds ofsalmon, whales,
seals, andother seacreatures layround onthesand flatswhere the
people thatweresaved could getthem. Theyhadenough from that

Quite awhile before thisflood tookplace theshamans hadpredicted

Byandbyhecame towhere warwasgoing onbetween twodifferent

everhebrought inanoldman, however, thelatter would talk of
whatgoodfoodhehadbeen eating andwhat ahighfamily hebelonged
to,ortellwhat awild lifehehad ledwhen hewasyoung,allwhich
hadnointerest forthechief. Hethoughtifhecould findanoldman
thatwould tellhimjusttheoldstory hewanted, hewould payhim
well. Finally hefound thatamonghisenemies wasOld-man-who-
foresees-all-troubles-in-the-world, theonespokenofatthebeginning
ofthisstory, andhesent forhimwithout letting therest ofhis
enemies know about it.
After awhile heheard this oldmancoming along, talking very
loud,likeabraveperson, andhethought,&quot;This istheoldmanfrom

ifyouarepleased with thestoryIamabout totellyou,letmeknow

nextdaytheywaited onhim, giving himwater towash hishands

After thattheoldman sent forapieceofAlaska maple (q!atq!e )

The chief dideverything just ashehadbeen directed. Atmid

peopleofthatvillage sawthat thechiefwasdead. They thought
thathehaddied ofheartdisease, but,when theyexamined hisbody,
theyfound thesmall arrowsticking into hisheart. Then they cut

heagain hadhissistersingthewarsongandhisniece beat thedrum,

Now thechief ssister putonherbrother swar clothes, while her

Then thechildren ofthesunwere allveryhappy, andmade so

Therefore nowadays people dothesamething. When they fight

Therefore shetookgoodcareinselectingahusband forherdaughter,
because shefelt ifshedidsoshewouldgetallofherrelatives back.
That iswhytheIndians ofgood family took suchgood care ofa

When theinhabitants ofthattownbecame verynumerous the

onlyhismother knew whathadhappened. Like hisfather, theboy
wasagreat hunter andfisherman. Before hecame thepeopleof
thattownhadbeen starving, butnow, especiallysincehehadobtained

alwaysfullofhalibut, seal,andsea-lion meat.
Then hisgrandmothersaid tohim, &quot;Grandson, donotgoover

whohave done sonever returned.&quot; This, however, onlymade the

Another time hisgrandmother said tohim,&quot;There isaplace over

that.Hetook allofitsshellhome, andthepeople throughoutthe

Aftersome timehadpassed, herparents sawtwosmall devilfishes on

were inherhair,andshelooked badly, although shehadformerly
been very pretty. Herfather andmother were very sorry. Then
theysetoutfood forthem andafterward took thetraysdown tothe
place where the little oneshadgoneunder therock.
Now thechief invited allofthepeopleinto hishouse, gavethem
tobacco tochew, andtoldthemhowbadly hefelt. After theyhad

talked thematter over forawhile they said tohim,&quot;You mightas
wellhave allthedevilfishes killed. When those small ones aregrown

on,theycould seelargeandsmall devilfishes cominginthrough every
little crack until thehouse gotquitefullofthem, andsome people
were suffocated byhaving thedevilfishes cover their mouths. The
devilfish thattheyhad killed waschiefamong them.
Just then Man-that-eats-the-leavings came tothat town, and
theytoldhimwhat ahard timetheywerehaving every night with
thedevilfish,sohestayed withthem until evening. When they
came inthistimeheseemed tohave control overthem, andthey
ceased bothering thepeople. Thelargedevilfishes arecalled dAgasa/.
Thesmall ones,which theythrew down onthebeach, arethose that
theAlaskan Indians see,butthese donotinjure anyone nowbecause
their grandfather wasahuman being.
Afterward theybathed thegirltotake allthedevilfish offofher,
andputfineclothing onher.Herfacewasvery pretty,sothat all

Coming down tothebeach atacertainplace, hefound afinebayand
built hishouse uponit.There hebegantocollect clams and fish
which hedried forhimself. Hewasgoneallwinter, butinthose
times theIndians didnotcare forfoolishpeople, viewing them as

While helived inthatplacethechiefheard adrum sounding from

Finally hediscovered thatthenoisewascaused byagrouse andsaid

thismanforgotallthathehadbeengrieving about and feltvery

Then thechief said tothegrouse,&quot;How cameyoutoknow about

Theman didashehadbeendirected, andthedayafterbeganto

nothard forhim.Healso feltthathecould dance, andbegan dancing
thesame evening. While doingsohewasvery lightuponhisfeet.He
wasasifinatrance, notknowing exactly what hewasdoing. Then
hethoughttohimself,&quot;Iamgoingtothenext town.&quot; Sohewent
there andbegan singing, and itwassoon noised about,&quot;Amanhas
come herewho isagreat singer. He isgoing todanceto-night.&quot;
Then allthepeople went tothathouse where hewas todance. He
danced andtaught thewomen hissongs, which wereverysad.He
sangabout thedifferent clans [among theHaida], picking outonly
good clans. Sotheyoung women ofthose families began tobring
himpresents, andeach thought,&quot;Iwillgivethe most.&quot; They gave
him allkinds ofthings, robes, furshirts, blankets, leggings. Hewas

danced farbetter. Atthistheyouthsboyfriends said tohim,
&quot;What makes youdosuch athing? Itdoesn tlook rightforyou
todo it.&quot;They tried tomakehimbelieve hewasabove dancing,
because theywerejealousofhim. Sohewent tothemanwhohad
instructed him,andthelatter said, &quot;Peoplewilldothis (i.e.,dance)

you.&quot; Theyouth hadcomposed somany beautiful songs that all
thegirlshadfallen inlovewithhim. Thatwaswhytheother youths
were jealousofhim. The firstdancer also said tohim,&quot;It isnot
high-caste peoplelikeyourself merely who willcompose songs. Every
bodywilllearn these andcompose others. Anybody thatcomposes
songslikethisafterhaving made medicine willhave hisnamebecome
greatinthe world.&quot;
When thisyouth hadtold hisfather allhehadlearned, hisfather
asked allthepeopleofthattown tocome tohishouse andrepeated
ittothem. Then hesaid,&quot;Idonotthink itiswell forahigh-caste
persontocompose songs andbeadancer. They saythat apersons
name willbecome very highandbeknown everywhereifhecom
poses songs andbecomes adancer, butachiefs sonsname isalready
high,andachief sname isknown everywhere. Why should hecom
pose songs anddance tomake itso? Itisbetter that thepoorer
people should dothisandmake theirnames known inthe world.&quot;
Ifthechiefhadnotsaidthis,people thatcompose songs anddance
would bevery scarce amongus. Itisbecause thechief said,&quot;Let
itbeamong thepoorer peoplesothat theirnames maybeknown/
that there aresomany composers anddancers among us.Forno
chiefcomposesordances without giving awayagreat dealofproperty.
Thus ithappens thatthere aretwokinds ofdances, adance forthe
chiefandhissonsand thiscommon orHaida dance (Dekl naALle x).
Inthelatter,women always accompanyitwith songs, and,ifthe
composer sings about some good family, members ofthelatter give
himpresents. When thechief isgoingtodance, hehastobevery
careful nottosayanything outoftheway. Hedances wearinga
head dress with weasel skins, aChilkat blanket, andleggings and
carryingaraven rattle. He istheonlyonewhose voice isheard, and
hespeaks very quietly. Meanwhile, until itistime forthem tostart
singingforhim, thepeoplearevery quiet andthen only high-caste
people sing. TheHaida dance, however,isalways accompanied by
noise. Itisrather adance forpleasure,while thechief sdance is
more ofaceremony. Although most ofthepeople whowitness it
arehigh-caste, anyoneiswelcome. Allwatch the.chiefs actions and
listen tohiswords very closely.Ifhemakes theleast mistake, show
ingthathehasnotstudied hiswords beforehand very well,theyhave
toomuch respectforhim tosayanythingtohimatthat time. Next
day,however, afterhehasfound itout,ifhedoesnottake hiswords
back, thepeoplethathadheard willdisgrace himbygiving awaya
great deal ofproperty. TheHaida dance wasdoneaway with years

After thistheshaman said,&quot;The land otters aregoingtomake

attacked them inreturn andthey warred forsome time. Many
peoplefelldown suddenly andweretakensick, while others were in

Sotheotters remained where they were, andtheycaught them and
putfeathers upontheir heads. They weremaking deer ofthem.
They tookthemhome tothefort inwhichthey dwelt andcarried

Atthesame time Black-skin wasmerely feigning weakness, and,

Thepeople wentoninthisway,bathing every daywith theirchief,
while Black-skin bathed atnight. After they werethrough,the
village people would make abig fire,takebreakfast andthengoafter

heard awhistle thatsounded tohim likethat ofaloon. Hethought,
&quot;Now that Iamseen Ibetter letmyself go.&quot; Sohewenttoward the

&quot;You can tdoityet.Don ttellanyone about me. IamStrength

Toward morning Black-skin came infeeling very happy,forhe
thoughtthathehadseensomething great. Hekept thinkingof

would never payanyattention, and,iftheysaidmeanthingstohim,

Sometimes the littleboyswould wrestle with him,andhepretended

Seeingthathewasdetermined to-getintheybegan pushingthecanoe

struck hisfingerstomakehim letgo.Itsounded likebeating upona

verylittle ofhisstrength, pulled thecanoe back, andjumpedin.
Then thepeopletalked verymeanlytohim,butthechief said,uOh!

sealions shall Iskin foryou?&quot; ButBlack-skin saidnothing.
The sea-lion island hadvery precipitoussides against which great
waves came, soGUlwe t!waited until thecanoe was lifteduponthe

Now,when Black-skin sawwhathadhappenedtohisuncle, hefelt
badly. Then heputhishand into hisbundle ofclothes, tookoutand

&quot;Iamtheman thatpulledoutthat limb, and Iamtheman that

frightened, thinking thathewould revenge himself onthem fortheir

leavehimoutthere? Why didn tyoubringhim in?&quot;
Meanwhile Black-skin took outthesea-lion intestines anddried
them. Hehadnothingtomake afirewithanddidnotknow what
heshould do.Sohelaydown andwent tosleep,hishead covered
with hisblanket. Then heheard somethingthatsounded likethe
beatingofsticks. Suddenly hewasawakened byhearing someone
say,&quot;Ihavecome afteryou.&quot; Helooked around, butcould notsee
anything exceptablack duckwhich wasswimming about infront of
him. Then hesawtheblack duckcoming toward himandsaidtoit,
&quot;Ihave seenyou already.&quot;Itanswered,&quot;Iamsent after you.
Getonmybackbutkeepyour eyesclosedtight.&quot; Sohedid.Then
theduck saidagain,&quot;Now openyour eyes.&quot; Heopened them and

Whydofishdieoncoming outofthewater ?Itisbecause theyhave

Meanwhile theelder wife ofthechief,whohadhelped Black-skin,
wasmourningforherhusband andnephew. Herhusband sbody
was stillonthat island. The olderpeoplewere alsosayingtothe
people whohad lefthim, &quot;Whydidyoudoit?Apowerfulfellow

widow begged theyoungmen togoback totheisland andbringhome
hernephew andherhusband sbody buttheyoungerwife didnot

there, butBlack-skin wasgone. Then theytookaboard thebody,
loaded thecanoe with thebodies ofsealions, andwenthome. When
theyheard ofitthewisepeopleallsaidthatsomething waswrong.
Theshamans saidthathewasnotdeadandthattheywould seehim

troubled thevillage peopleagreatdeal. Theyfeltvery badlyto

Black-skin, however, continued tostayamong thesealions. They
looked tohim likehuman beings,butheknewwhothey reallywere.
Inthesamehouse therewasaboycryingallthetimewithpain. The

One day, while hewasroasting fish,hesaweight Athapascans
(Gonana), andknew from that thathewas intheinterior. These
menwore nicefurclothing andhad their facespainted. Kakeq!ute
became frightened andranintothewoods, leavinghisfishroasting

calling him,soheclimbed upintoatreeandwatched them. They
didnotknow where hehadgone. Then themen satdown andate
hisfish,after which they stuck acopper-pointed arrow into the
ground where each roastingstickhadbeen. Thiswasthefirsttime

Next daythesamemencame back. They were dressed much

Byandbythesalmon season came. Thepeopletherehadcopper-

water was somuddy thatthey couldspear onlybymeans ofthe

anymanobtained was three.
KakeqKe watched andknew that hecouldhelp them. He
alwaystraveled around with hiswives brothers, andwherever they
went thepeople followed,fortheythought thatheknewhow toget
salmon. Heinquiredifthiswere theonlywaytheyknew oftocatch
salmon, andthey said, &quot;Yes,this istheonlywayexceptthatwhen
they getinashallowplacewecanclub them.&quot; One ofhisbrothers-

theyareveryoldandtheir flesh isturning white. Then thewater
islow,andtheygonear theshore where wecanseethem.Wecan

andtaught himhow tofeelalong theriver forsalmon andcatch

Next daythewholevillage went toworkmaking salmontraps.
Again heasked them togetyoungtreesandsplitthem. Alldidas
hetoldthem. Theymade eighteen traps thatday. They gotroots
andsplit them, and allworked taking thebark off.Thewhole
village imitated KakeqHe, watching hisevery movement. Next
daytheyputthetrapsinto thewater, and allwere very anxious
about them, even thewomensitting along theshore watching. Some
ofthepoor people, whoknew thattheywould result similarlytothe
firsttraps hehadmade, were soanxious toseethem thattheycould
notsleep. Thedaybefore allofthewomen satdown tomake ropes
inthemanner heshowed them, andeachwent tothetraps next
morning provided with one.When theygotthere theyfound every
oneofthem loaded with salmon. Allthepeopleinthetown, old
andyoung, went toseethesetraps. While theywereemptyingthe
traps andstringing some ofthesalmon, others would becoining in,

and itmade thewhole village happy. ThenKakeq!utedistributed
thesalmon,foreveryone thought that itbelonged tohim.Hegave
tothepoor people, whohadnever before tastedsalmon, andhesaid
tothewealthy,&quot;Don tfeeloffended that Igivethem asmuch as

Atthistime oftheyeartheynever gotanysalmon todry.Ifone

After hehadshown theAthapascansallthese things KakeqKe

peopletogoupwithhimalong thesame trailhehadtaken through

totheplacehehadleft,but,when theycamedown, thepeopleofthat
village were afraid ofthem. These were theTcukAnedi,Ka/gwAntan,
Wuckita n,Koskledi,T!Aq!dentan, LluklnAxAdi,andQlAtlkaa yi.
ByandbyoneoftheTcukAne dicame outright opposite themand
said,&quot;What areyoucoming herefor,youland-otter people? We

theysawthat those peopledidnotcare toreceive them theywent
back through thewoods tothetown oftheL!u!k!nAxA di.The
LluklnAxA disaw that theyhad coppers, andtookthem away.
Then theLluklnAxA disaid,&quot;You aregoingtobeourpeople.7
Eachman took aman out ofthecanoe and said,&quot;You will

theydid thistheTcukAne diarebelow allotherTlingitfamilies.
Thatwaswhat brought them bad luck, andthat isalsohow the

Thewives oftheL!uk!nAxA diwereKagwAntan. They (the

when theyinvited peopletothefeast forthese houses, theyfirstgave
awaytheslaves theyhadbeen buying. TheLluklnAxA difeltvery
badlyatthis, because Flathead slaves notbeing esteemed very
highlythisamounted tomore than theyhadgiven away. kThen
warbroke outbetween thetwo families, andtheL!uk!nAXA diwere
badly defeated, losing many people.After that thepeople -whose
friends hadbeen enslaved, purchased, andgiven awayfeltsobadly
thattheyalsomadewarontheGanAxte diwithnobetter result.
One oftheGanAxte dichiefs wasnamed Yel-xak. Inthose times
people were afraid ofahigh-caste person whowasrich, strong, and
brave anddidnotwant tohaveanythingtodowithhim. Thisman s
father-in-law wasaLluklnAxA dichief atLaxayi knamed BigRaven
(Yel-Len). ThenYel-xak told hisslaves totakefoodandtobacco to
hisfather-in-law through theinterior byAlsekriver, andhedidso.
When hearrived, thechief said tohim,&quot;What didyoucome for?&quot;
&quot;Your daughter hassentmewithsome tobacco/ BigRaven was
very fond oftobacco. Before theslave started onthiserrand his
master hadsaid tohim,&quot;Besure tonotice every word hesayswhen,
yougivehimthe tobacco.&quot; Then theslave tookaway from the
tobacco thecottonwood leaves andafinepieceofmoose hide inwhich
itwaswrapped. Assoon ashesawtheleaves BigRavensaid,&quot;Ifeel
asthoughIhadseenChilkat nowthat Ihave seen these cottonwood
leaves. Chilkat isarespectable place.Alotofrespectable people
livethere. They aresogood thatthey givefoodeven tothepeople
thatwere goingtofightthem.&quot; ThisBigRaven wasashaman and
averyrichone.
When theslave returned toChilkat andtold hismaster what Big
Raven hadsaid,theyheldacouncil thesame eveninginCkuwu-yels
house, Whale house, andYel-xak said tohisslave,&quot;Nowyoutellthese
people what that father-in-law ofmine hassaid toyou.&quot; And the
slave said,&quot;Assoon ashesawme,hesaid,What areyoudoing here?
and Itoldhimthat hisdaughter hadsentmetohimwith tobacco.
After hehaduncovered thetobacco andhadseen theleaves hesaid,
Theyaresuchrespectable peopleinChilkat thattheyfeedeven the
people whohadcome tofight them. That waswhat BigRaven
said.&quot; ThenYel-xaksaid,&quot;Iwonder ifhethinks hehasgotten even
withmefortheL!uk!nAxA diIkilled onLand-otterpoint.Iwonder
whether hethinks hehasgotten even withmeforhaving killed all
those atAnAk!-nu.&quot; Hethought thatBigRaven wasacoward and
wasgoingtomakepeace. Then hemoved about veryproudly, while
thevisitors from other places watched himclosely, andeverything
thathesaidordidwasreportedtoBigRaven.
Amanamong theLluklnAxAdi,named Cadisi ktc,wasbathingin

Thepeople said,&quot;What areyousaying, BigRaven? Gowherever

andheshouted, &quot;Here, here isthecamping place.&quot; After thespirithadbeen allover their course itsaid, &quot;Ho, he,theRavenswinging

thought that itgrewinthetimber andnotthat itbelonged toaship.
Thistheycalled Gayes!hawu(LogofIron). Gayes!wasoriginally
thename given toblack rnud along thebeaches towhichpeople

Now thewarcanoes started from Kosle xforChilkat, drilling as
they went. Whenpeople dothisthe} take outtheirdrums and
drillwhereverpossible. There arecertain songs called&quot;drilling

which somany hadbeen killed bytheChilkat before. TheKiksAdi,TUqldentan, andother families alsostarted withthem, andtheypaid
these fortheir helpwithcopper plates.Allthistime theshaman s
spirit sang thesame song about &quot;the raven swinging back and

Atlastthewarriors reached Chilkat andstood inarowfronting
theriver back oftheChilkat fort. Behind allstood Cadisi ktc.
Then Yel-xak came outontopofthefortand said,&quot;Where isthat
Cadisi ktc?&quot; SoCadisi ktcstepped outinfront ofhisparty with the
mouse warhatonhishead, saying,&quot;Here Iam.&quot; ThenYel-xaksaid,
&quot;Where hasthatmouse (kutsli n)been? What hashebeendoing?&quot;
Heanswered,&quot;Ihavebeen inthatgreatmountain thatbelonged to
mymother suncle, andIhavecome outafteryou.&quot;After thisthey
heard adrum inthefort,which meant that those peoplewereabout
tocome out.Then theycame outinfiles,andYel-xak andCadi
siktcwent tomeet each other with theirspears. ButtheChilkat
stillhad their spears pointed wTithbone andmountain-goat horn,

however, wentdown with thecanoe. AGonaqAdethadswallowed

Alongwith thiscanoe hadcomedown another, whichstoppedfor

asked whether thehead chiefhadreturned, andthey said,&quot;No.&quot;
Then hetoldthemhowstrangelytheseahadacted andhowhe

After hehadremained inthevillageforfivedays thecanoe chief
begantothinkseriously about thechief sabsence. Then hegotinto

Formerly therewasbutonevillage ontheQueen Charlotte islands
(Deki qoanani,Town-far-out). Every daythepeople used togoout

man. Though thepeopleallabout hiscanoe were pullinginfishhe

41.THEIMAGE THATCAME TOLIFE
Ayoungchief ontheQueen Charlotte islands married, andsoon
afterwards hiswife fell ill.Then hesentaround everywhereforthe
very bestshamans. Ifthere were averyfineshaman atacertain
village hewould send acanoe there tobring him. None ofthem
could help her,however, andafter shehadbeen sick foravery long
time shedied.
Now theyoungchief feltverybadly over thelossofhiswife. He
wentfromplacetoplaceafter thebestcarvers inorder tohavethem
carve animageofhiswife, butnoonecouldmake anythingtolook
likeher. Allthistime therewasacarver inhisownvillage whocould
carvemuch better than alltheothers. Thismanmethimoneday
andsaid,&quot;You aregoing fromvillagetovillagetohavewood carved

Ihave seenyour wifeagreatdealwalking along with you.Ihave
never studied herfacewith theideathatyoumight wantsome oneto
carveit,butIamgoingtotryifyouwillallow me.&quot;
Then thecarver went after apieceofredcedar andbegan working
uponit.When hewasthrough, hewent totheyoungchiefandsaid,
&quot;Now youcancome along andlook at it.&quot;Hehaddressed itjustas
heused toseetheyoungwoman dressed. Sothechiefwentwithhim,
and,when hegotinside, hesawhisdead wifesittingtherejustasshe
used tolook. Thismadehimveryhappy, andhetook ithome. Then
heasked thecarver,&quot;What doIoweyouformakingthis?&quot; andhe
replied,&quot;Do asyouplease about it.&quot;Thecarver had feltsorryto
seehow thischiefwasmourningforhiswife, sohesaid,&quot;It isbecause
Ifeltbadlyforyouthat Imade that. Sodon tpaymetoomuch for
it.&quot;Hepaid thecarver very well, however, both inslaves and in
goods.
Now thechief dressed thisimageinhiswife sclothes andher
marten-skin robe. Hefeltthat hiswifehadcome back tohimand
treated theimage justlike her.Oneday, while hesatmourning
veryclose totheimage, hefelt itmove. Hiswifehad alsobeen

atsome time itwould come tolife.When heatehealways hadthe
imageclose tohim.
After awhile thewhole village learned thathehad thisimage and
allcame intosee it.Manycould notbelieve that itwasnotthe
woman herself until theyhadexamined itclosely.
Oneday,after thechiefhadhad itforalong, long time, heexam
ined thebody andfound itjustlikethat ofahuman being. Still,
althoughitwas alive,itcould notmove orspeak. Some timelater,
however, theimage gaveforth asound from itschest likethat of
crackling wood, andthemanknew that itwas ill.When hehad
some onemove itaway from theplace where ithadbeensitting they
found asmall red-cedar treegrowingthere ontopoftheflooring.
Theyleft ituntil itgrewtobevery large, and itisbecause ofthisthat
cedars ontheQueen Charlotte islands aresogood. Whenpeople up
thiswaylook forredcedars and find agood onethey say,&quot;This
looks likethebabyofthechief swife.&quot;
Every daytheimageoftheyoungwoman grewmore likeahuman
being, and,when theyheard thestory, people fromvillagesfarand

atwhich theywereverymuch astonished. Thewoman moved around

Then shewentbackandsaid tothegirl,&quot;Areyou coming?&quot; &quot;No,&quot;

heraunt said,&quot;Ihaveputalivecoal inthatbrush house along with
apieceofdried salmon.&quot;
Assoon astheothers hadgoneaway theorphan made abigfire
andcooked herroots andsalmon, butshedidnot feel likeeating.
Therefore, instead ofdoing so,shewrentaway anddugsome more
roots. Intheevening shewent back toherbrush house, thinking
shecould eatnow, butfound that shehadnoappetite. Soshe
laydown andwent tosleep. Earlyinthemorning shewasawak
enedbyagreat noisewhich shefound onlooking outwasmadebya
flock ofbrants(qen). She feltsotired thatshelaydown again and
went tosleep, and,when sheawoke oncemore, shethought shewould
setoutaftermore roots. Going down tothe flatwhere these roots
grew, shefound itcovered with brants feeding upon them. When
theysawhertheyflewaway. Then shebegan removing thedead
grass from theplace where shewasgoingtodig,andtohersurprise
cameuponseveral bigcanoes looking asiftheyhadbeenburiedthere,
which were loaded witheulachonoil,dried eulachon, driedhalibut,
anddried salmon. She feltveryhappy. Shethought howluckyit
wasthat shehadremained therewhen allofthevillage people were
starving.
Now theorphan thought thatshewould eatsomething, soshetook
some salmon andabundle ofhalibut home with her.Onroasting
apieceofsalmon, however, shefound thatshecould noteat it.She
didnotknow whathadgottenintoherthatshecould notforce her
selftoeat. Shewished thatherauntwerewith her. Nextmorning
shediscovered that thespirits were keeping foodaway from her
because shewasbecoming ashaman. Thebrants hadbecome her
spirits. Thebrantspirits always come toRaven peoplelike her.
Soshebecame agreatshaman andwaspossessed byspirits every
day, while seagulls, crows, and allkinds ofseaandwoodland birds
sangforher. Thishappened every day. T\vo orthree times aday
shewould gotoseetheburied canoes, butshecould noteatanything,
andshegaveupdigging roots because shehadnowayofsharpening
hersticks. Meanwhile everyoneinthevillage thought that shehad
starved todeath.
Aftersome timehadpassed,thegirlwished thatsomeonewould come
toherfrom thevillage, andthedayafter acanoe appearedinsight.
Thismade herveryhappy, especially when itgotcloseandshefound
itcontained some peopleofheracquaintance from thevillage. She
called themuptoherbrush house andgavethemsome foodfrom the
canoes, andtheyremained there twoorthree days. They were out
huntingforfood. After awhile shetoldthem itwastime forthem

nottake abitofthefood Ihave given you. Leave itallhere. Tell
thepeopleofourvillage thatDjfyinisstillliving and isdoingwell.
Tellmyaunt thatshemusttrytogethere assoon asshe can.&quot;
When these people gotback tothevillage andtoldwhathadhap
penedtotheorphan, howmuch food shehadandhowlucky she
hadbeen,allthetown people whohadbeen dyingofstarvation
started offimmediatelyfortheplace where shewasliving. When
theycame insightofherbrush house theysawthatfrom thesky
rightdown toittheairwas filled with birds. There were somany

andwomen singing andtheshaman performing, but,when they
came close,allofthebirds flewaway.
Assoon astheshaman heard that herpeople werecoming she
walked outtomeetthem andasked,uWhich canoe ismyaunt in?
Letherland here.7Allofthefood inoneofhercanoes shegaveto
heraunt. Then shesaid,&quot;Iwant twowomen tocome ashore to
helpmewithmy singing.&quot; The high-caste women inthecanoes,
whowere allpainted up,would riseoneafter theother, butshewould
nothave them, andfinallycalled twowhowereorphanslikeherself
andhadbeen treated verybadly bytheirownpeople.Alltheothers
then started tocome ashore, andshetoldthemwhere tocamp. She
hadroom enough inherownhouseonlyforthetwogirlsandher

These high-caste people hadbroughttheir slaves withthemwhen
theycame toher,andshegotthem herself inexchangeforfood.
Shehadthree brush houses built toholdthem. Shealsodressed up

time thepeoplelefthertoreturn totheirownvillage, and,when
another longperiod hadelapsed, herspiritmade thetown chiefsick,
andthey hired hertocome andtreat him.
Thisshaman hadbelonged toavery high-caste family, butthey
haddied offand leftherverypoor,andnothing remained ofheruncle s

theshaman wasentering thevillage shesawtheposts ofheruncle s

stood there. Then they carried allofherthings intothis,andshe
hadtheslaves shehadprocured work forher,while thetwoorphans
shehadtaken werenowconsidered high caste.
Atthattime thesick chief sdaughter also fell sick. Then the
spirits turned alltheminds ofthechief speople away fromher,and
they paid other shamans inthevillage. The sickones, however,
