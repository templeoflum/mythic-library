Allthepeopleinavillagecalled Tasna, &quot;just south ofthemouth
oftheYukon,&quot; once died ofsmallpoxwith theexceptionofone
woman andherson. Theboywasjustoldenoughtorealize what
hadhappened.Hismother keptweeping dayafter day,and itso
distressed hersonthathewent offhuntingwithbowandarrows and
didnotreturn untilhethoughtshewasthrough.
Onedayhe\vent farther than herealized andonturning about
waspuzzledtoknow where thevillage lay.Hewalked foralong
time indifferent directions tryingtofind itbutinvain. Hewas
lostandhad tocampthatnight. Next morning hebegan looking
again, andhelooked alldaywithnobetter success. Onthethird
morning,afterhehadlooked about untilhe\vasvery tired, hecaught
sightofwater throughthetrees and,thinkingitwastheocean, ran
quicklytoward it.When hecameuptoit,however, hefound itwas
onlyalake. Heremained there forsome time, living onroots, and
afterward continued hisjourney. Againhetraveled alldayandon
thefollowing morning heagain sawwater throughthewoods. Now
hefelthappy oncemore, butwhen hecame dowrntoitandlooked
around,lo!itwasthesame lakehehad left.
Bythistime theboywastootired towalkanymore, sohethought,
Well !Imightaswellstayrighthere.&quot; Hecovered himself upwith
moss andwent tosleep. Suddenly, however, hewrasawakened by
avoicesaying,&quot;Who isthisboy?&quot; Helooked around butsawno
one.Hewasentirelyalone. Then hefellasleep again, andagain
something said,&quot;Who isthisboy?&quot; Hethought thathewasdream
ing, for,when helooked around, hesawonlyablack duck farouton

After thistheboysaid tohimself, Now Iamgoingtositupand
watch.&quot; Soheseated himselfagainstalargebush and,although he
became sosleepythere that hiseyeskept closing, hewould open
themresolutely andkeeponthewatch.Finally hegotupandwent
behind thebush. While hiseyeswereclosed, theboyheard thesame

andsawtheblack duck(gaxu

saidtheman. Then thoboytoldhimhowhehadgottenlost. &quot;All

getaway fromher, soItraveled inthewoods alone andbecame
lost. Since thatdayIhave notbeenhome toseemymother.&quot;
Then themantook offhiscoat,gaveittotheboy,andsaid,&quot;Put on
thiscoat. Assoon asyouhavedoneso,stretch outyourarmsand
keep goinglike that. Don tthink ofmeanddon tthink ofthis
lake. Think ofyour uncle shouse.&quot;
Theboydidashehadbeentold,and itseemed tohimthathe
wasflying along very rapidlyfarabove thetrees. Foralongtime
hethoughtofnothingelsethan hisuncle shouse and hisuncle s
village, butatlength heremembered thelakeand lo !hewasthere
oncemore with themanstandingbefore him inthesameplace.
Then themansaid,&quot;Didn tItellyounottothink ofmeorthelake?
Start overagain. Think ofnothing butyour uncle shouse andthe
village youarebound for.&quot; Sothistime theboytried very hard,
and allatoncehecame outback ofhisuncle shouse, where hismother
waswaiting andcallingforhim.When sherecognized himshewas
veryhappy.
56.THEBOYWHOSHOTTHESTAR
Twovery high-caste boys were chums. The father ofonewas
town chiefandhad hishouse inthemiddle ofthevillage, butthe
house oftheotherboysfather stood atoneend. These boyswould
goalternatelytoeach other shouses andmakegreat quantitiesof
arrows which theywouldplaywith until allwerebrokenup.
Onetimeboth oftheboysmade agreat quantityofarrows to
seewhich could have themore. Justback oftheirvillage wasahill
onthetopofwhich wasasmoothgrassy place claimed bytheboys
astheirplayground, andonacertainfine,moonlight night they
started thither. Astheywere going alongthelesser chief sson,who
wasahead, said,&quot;Look here, friend. Look atthatmoon. Don t
youthink that theshapeofthatmoon isthesame asthat ofmy
mother slabret andthatthesize isthesame,too?&quot; Theother an
swered,&quot;Don t.Youmust nottalkthatwayofthe moon.&quot; Then
suddenlyitbecame verydark about them andpresentlythehead

appearedhiscompanion wasgone. Hecalled andcalled tohimbut
didnotgetanyanswer anddidnotseehim.Hethought,&quot;Hemust

andsawthemoon inthesky. Then heclimbed thehill,andlooked
about, buthisfriend wasnotthere. Now hethought,&quot;Well! the
moon must have goneupwith him. That circular rainbow must
havebeen the moon.&quot;
Theboythus leftalone satdown andcried, afterwhich hebegan
totrythebows. Heputstrings onthem oneafter theother and

Hethought,&quot;Now Iamgoingtoshoot that starnext tothe moon.&quot;
Inthatspotwasalargeandvery brightone.Heshotanarrow at
thisstarandsatdown towatch, when, sureenough, thestardarkened.
Now hebegan shootingatthat starfrom thebigpilesofarrows
heand hischum hadmade, andhewasencouraged byseeing that
thearrows didnotcome back. After hehadshot forsome timehe
sawsomething hanging down verynearhim, and,when heshotup
another arrow,itstuck tothis. Thenext didlikewise, andatlastthe
chain ofarrows reached him.Heputalastoneontocompleteit.
Now theyouthfeltbadlyforthe loss ofhisfriend and, lying
down under thearrow chain, hewent tosleep. After awhile he
awoke, found himselfsleeping onthathill,remembered thearrows
hehadshotaway, andlooked up. Instead ofthearrows therewasa
long ladder reaching rightdown tohim.Hearose andlooked so
astomake sure. Then hedetermined toascend.First, however,
hetook various kinds ofbushes andstuckthem intotheknot ofhair
heworeonhishead. Heclimbed uphisladder alldayandcamped
atnightfall upon it,resuminghisjourneythefollowing morning.
When heawokeearly onthesecond morninghishead feltvery
heavy. Then heseized thesalmonberry bush thatwasinhishair,
pulleditout,andfound itwasloaded with berries. After hehad
eaten theberriesoff,hestuck thebranch back into hishairand felt
verymuchstrengthened. About noon ofthesamedayheagainfelt
hungry, andagainhisheadwasheavy,sohepulled outabushfrom
theother side ofhisheadand itwasloaded with blue huckleberries.
Itwasalready summer there inthesky. That waswhyhewas
gettingberries. When heresumed hisjourney nextmorninghis
head didnot feelheavyuntil noon. Atthattimehepulled outthe
bush attheback ofhisheadandfound itloaded with redhuckle
berries.
Bythetimehehadreached thetoptheboywasverytired. He
looked round andsawalargelake. Then hegathered some soft
brush andsomemoss andlaydown tosleep. But, while heslept,
someperson came tohimandshook himsaying,&quot;Getup.Iam
afteryou.&quot; Heawoke andlooked around butsawnoone. Then
herolled overandpretended togotosleep again butlooked out
throughhiseyelashes. Byandbyhesawavery small buthand
somegirlcoming along. Herskin clothes wereverycleanandneat,
andherleggings wereornamented withporcupine quills. Just asshe
reached outtoshake himhesaid,&quot;Ihave seenyou already.&quot;Now thegirlstood stillandsaid,&quot;Ihavecome afteryou.My
grandmother hassentmetobring youtoher house.&quot; Sohewent

after,my grandson?&quot; andtheboyanswered,&quot;On account ofmy
playmate whowastakenuphither.&quot; ltOh !answered theoldwoman,
&quot;he isnext door, onlyashort distance away.Icanhearhim
crying every day.He isinthemoon shouse.&quot;
Then theoldwoman begantogivehimfood. Shewould puther
handuptohermouth, andasalmon orwhatever shewasgoingto
givewould make itsappearance. After thesalmon shegavehim
berries andthenmeat,forsheknew thathewashungry from his
long journey. After thatshegavehimaspruce cone, arosebush,
apieceofdevil sclub,andasmallpieceofwhetstone totakealong.
Astheboywasgoing toward themoon shouse with allofthese
things heheard hisplaymate screaming withpain. Hehad be.en
putuponahigh place near thesmoke hole, so,when hisrescuer
came toit,heclimbed ontop,and,reaching down through the
smoke hole, pulled himout.Hesaid, &quot;My friend, come. Iamhere
tohelp you.&quot; Puttingthespruce conedown where theboyhad
been, hetold ittoimitate hiscries, andheand hischum ranaway.
After awhile, however, theconedropped from theplace where it
hadbeenput,andthepeople discovered that theircaptive had
escaped. Then themoon started inpursuit. When thehead
chief ssondiscoveredthis,hethrew behind them thedevil sclub
hehadreceived from theoldwoman, andapatchofdevil sclub
arose which themoon hadsomuch trouble ingetting through that
theygained rapidly onhim.When themoon again approached, the
head chief ssonthrew back therosebushes, andsuch athicket of
roses grewthere that themoon wasagain delayed. When heap
proached them once more, theythrew back thegrindstone, and it
became ahighclifffrom which themoon kept rolling back. Itis
onaccount ofthis cliffthatpeople cansaythings about themoon
nowadays withimpunity. When theboys reached theoldwoman s
house theywere very gladtoseeeach other, forbefore thisthey
hadnothadtime tospeak.
The oldwoman gavethem somethingtoeat,and,whenthey
were through, shesaid totherescuer,&quot;Goand liedown atthe
placewhere youlaywhenyoufirstcameup.Don tthink ofanything

Astheboys layinthatplace theyheard adrum beatinginthe

&quot;No,letuswaithere until that feast isover.&quot; Afterward theboys
wentdown andwatched thepeople come outwith their faces all
blackened. Theystood atacorner, but,asthisdance isalways

Then thehead chief ssonthought,&quot;Iwishmyyoungerbrother
would comeout,&quot; andsureenough,after alloftheother people had
gone,hisyoungerbrother came out.Hecalled tohisbrother say
ing,&quot;Come here. ItisI,&quot;butthechildwas afraid andraninto

hismother. &quot;Don tyouknow thatyourbrother diedsome time

Then thebigmanstopped and lethimdown, andheshot thebird
with anarrow andputitinto hisbosom, afterwhich hecrawled
back intothebigman sshirt. Butnow thisbirdhadincreased the

After thistheboyscompanion hadnothingtofear,andwandered

Oneevening, however, theboybegan thinkingofhisfather and

After that GAinna/tck!i feltvery badly andthoughttohimself,uHowcanIgetmywifeback? Howcan Ilook forherunder the

Inthemorning, therefore, before hehadeaten hetook hisredand

Byandbyhecame toavillagefull ofvery pale people who
went about with their heads down. Hefound outthattheywere
thered-cod people. Hewanted tomake friends ofthem, so,think
ingthat they looked very white, hepainted them allredmen,

After thatheasked them iftheyhadseen hiswife, butthey said
thattheyhadseennoone, sohewent on. Presently hecame to
anothervillage andasked thepeoplethere thesamequestionto
which hereceived theverysame answer. Those were thehalibut
people. Ineachvillage theygavehimsomethingtoeat.
After hehad leftthehalibut people GAmna tckli traveled for
several daysbefore hecame toanother town. Byandby,however, he
perceived smoke farahead ofhim,and,going towardit,hesawthat it
wasfrom afort. Inside ofthis fortwasalarge house which he
immediately entered, butthepeoplethere didnotseem tocare to

been jealousofthekiller whales because theyhad thiswoman.
While theshark people weretelling himwhat todo,astrange, bony-

Just after thattheman started forthekiller-whale townandsat

Then, when theslave thought thathehadgottenalong distance

Assoon ashegotthere, thesharkpeople begantodress themselves

Just asthedevilfishes reached thehole ofthehln-tayl ci,thelatter

said,uDonotfeelbadlyifyoushould happentohear ofme,&quot;andhe
went away.
Thismanhadseven sisters,allofthem verywelloff,butthey
would nothaveanythingtodowithhim. Very earlyinthemorning
hewent totheir houses andawakened theboys. Without asking
thepermissionoftheirmothers hetoldthem togettheirbows and
arrows quicklyandcome along with him. Next morning, after he
hadwalked withthem forsome distance, theyfound acanoe, andhe
hadthem allgetinto it.Intheevening, when their unclecamped
withthem, thechildren begantofeelthatsomething waswrong, and
some cried, sayingthattheywanted togetback totheir fathers and

Some oftheboyswerenowquite large. Later theycame toalong
sandy beach, and their unclemade ahouse there outofdriftwood.

Duringthesecond night they spent there, Dancer heard thetwo

animal andatlasttheysaw itdisappearintoahole inamountain.
Meanwhile Dancer took theclayey substance from allofthearrows,

thearrows back totheboys.
Now, Dancer made theplacehistown, andcontinued tolivethere
with hisnephews whoweregrown up.The stuffhehadtaken from

Then they returned totheirownplace, andafterward theuncle
feltthatsomepeoplewhom theyknew werecomingtoseethem.
Thesepeople were hisbrothers-in-law, whohadbeenhuntingforhim

people uptothehouse. They entered, and allthetime theywere
there kept looking atoneanother andwhispering, wondering what
Dancer haddone with their children. But, though theycamped

Next morning, however, just before they gotinto their canoe,
Dancer said toeachman inturn,&quot;This isyour boy. This isyour

Anorphan girlintheTlingit country named SAhan(Orphan) was

totheir onlydaughter. Shewasveryfond ofgoingtothecreek to
getwater, andthechief sdaughter always accompaniedher. Every
time theywent thechief sdaughter would drink water from this
creekagainsttheprotestsofherfostersister, and itmade hervery
unlucky. When shemarried intoanother high-caste family herhus

Then hemarried Orphan, whowasvery bright andknewhow totake
care ofthings, andshemade him rich. Shewasquiet andpaida
greatdeal ofattention toherhusband. Thevillage people were also
verymuch pleased with her, forafter herhusband married her,they
lived offofhim.

herhusband wouldsay,tGoandgetyourdishes nowand letyour
brothers eat offofthem,&quot; butshealways answered, &quot;No,Idon t

Next thechief oftheTlhittanmight speakasfollows:
&quot;Down intheTsimshian countrylived ayoung high-caste woman
whowascaptured byadevilfish. Thepeople discovered thatshewas
lost, and-finally theybegan huntingforher,buttheycould findher
nowhere. After theyhadgivenuplooking forhertheysawsomeyoung
devilfish coming uponthedoorstep. They werethrown down from

leftthem alone, andtheyclimbed upintothechief slap.From this
circumstance hefound outwhathadhappened. Hesaid,cMydaughter
must havebeencaptured bythedevilfish. Then hegavefood tothe
devilfishes. When theywentaway thefood leftoverwascarried down
afterthemandthetra}^swere setdown bythedevilfish rock. When he
found outthat hisdaughter wasunder thatrock, hefeltveryhappy.a
&quot;So itwaswithyou,myson. Itwasasifyouhadbeen captured
bythedevilfishes. Therefore, theseyourfather speople havecome
down toaskyoutopartakeoffoodwiththemfrom under thatrock.
That ishowyourfather speople have gotten younow. Therefore
theyhave taken theclothes offofyouthathavebeenwetbythesea
water andwhich youcannotyourselfsee. Itwassowith thatwoman.
Shecould notseethatherclothes were inthatcondition. Just soyou

taken away from youwasjust asthough youhadbeencaptured by

becomfortable. Aayua(Thisisso).&quot;
Thechiefwould answer thus:

Finally theysaytothechief oftheQatcAdi, &quot;Now youspeakafew

andsays:
&quot;There was ahigh-caste personatTAqdjik-an whobathed for

Then heheard thevoice ofhisStrength. While hewas inbathinga
voice called tohimsaying, Come here. Sohewent thither. When
hegotthere, the littleman(Strength) andhewrestled, andDuktu L!
wasthrown down. After hehadbeenthrown down, Strengthsaid
tohim,Goagainintothewater andbathe. Iwillcome toyouonce
more. Heheard thevoice asecond time, andwent ashore, andthey
again wrestled. Then Duktu L!almost threwStrength down. So
Strength said, That isenough. You arealready sufficiently strong.
Then hewent up,pulled thelimb outandtwisted thetreetotheroots.
Afterward heputthelimb back anduntwisted thetree.Now he
wentaway andmade thepeople whohadbeen soproud, ashamed of
themselves. Thispoorman,DuktuL!,came tobeabove theproud
people.
&quot;After thattheywent tothesea-lion island. There heshowed his
strength. Then theproud people wentaway and lefthimonthat

Thedances arefollowed bythefeast and lastofallcomes thedis

above. Then thechiefwouldsay:
&quot;Up above hereamongtheupper villages (i.e.,toward thenorth)
there wasacertain woman who saidsomething about thebrant that
brought herbad luck. Herhusband snamewasDAmnfidji.Then
thebrants flewaway with her. After thatshefellfrom thehands of

Then thepeople invited tothefeast say,&quot;Yes,itwillbeso.We

After thathecallsthename ofthechief ofeachRaven clan, asfollows:

Raven smother kept losingherchildren,untilHeron toldherto

tried tomakehuman beingsoutofrockandleaf,butthelatter was

that iftheylived rightthere would beagood place forthem after

taught peopletohave slaves andshamans, also tomake allkinds of
hooks, spears, traps, andcanoes. Hewent under theseaandvisited
allofthe lishpeople, teaching menafterward that fisharereally

birdswhattheywere tobelike.Hetoldwhat theland otterwoulddo,
especially how itwould capture men. [Here follows theaccount of
KAka,story 5.]Afterthis,Raven lived inacliffnearTaku with
North Wind, andthat iswhypeople believe that cliffs areinhabited by
spirits. Healsotaught them thetabus tobeusedwhenpaddling onthe
rivers. Thekiller-whale chief tookhim intoasweat house andtried
toroast him,butRaven outwitted himbyconcealingapieceofice
near by.Hetaught thepeoplethatthere were Athapascans, andhe
taughttheChilkat people how tokeepsalmon frozen instorehouses all

NowRaven went toLaxayi kandtaughtthepeoplethere tomake
skin canoes. Aman inthatcountrykilled allofhiswife speople
andkepttheir hands inabasket inhishouse. When shefound it

Afterward theymade histown sinkunder theseawitheverybodyin

Hewent intotheinterior andlived withtwogiants successively. He

manhadcarried himhomeRaven continued toinstruct thegiant, and
helped himburnWolverine-man sbody, which turned intomosquitoes
andgnats.
Comingtoanotherplace, Raven found awoman andherdaughter
living alone, andhetoldthelatterhow tomake firewith the fire
drill,andthen toldhertoeatsome ofthepowderthatcomes from
it.Shegavebirth toaboy,whowascalled Fire-drill s-son. When
hegrewuphisfather, Fire-drill, gavehimadog,abowandarrows,
andaclub, withwhich hekilled Man- with-one-eye,ashaman who
haddestroyed thepeopleofhisvillage. Then hecame tothewife of
thisman,who killed people bythrowingherhand, which hadaknife
fastened toit,atthem, andhedestroyed heralso. Starting inland,
hecame toOld-mole-woman, who fedhimwith food taken from

birds tellhimabout their father andmother, whocame inclouds, and
killed them,afterwhich hegotground hogsfortheyoung onesand
toldthem nottoeathuman beings anymore. After thatheleft
enough foodwith hismother andgrandmothertolastthem alltheir
lives, andwentaway from them. Pursuing somethingcalled Dry-.

didnotstopuntil hereached thewolf people. These became jealous
ofhimandtried todestroy himbygetting him tojump through a
hoop which cutapersonintwo ifhefailed. Hisdog, however,
seized itandthrew ituptothemoon, where itbecame theringthat

wolves keptonafterDry-cloud andcame toanoldwoman who told
them thatthere wasamonster fishnearby.Onlookingatit.they
found onlyaredcod,which Fire-drill s-son killed. Heskinned itand
dried theskin. After thathemarried Daughter-of-thecalm, andthey

alitter ofpuppies bythedog. Afterward shefound thattheywere
able totake offtheirdogskinsandappearinhuman form, soshesur
prised them, gathered together theskins, andburnt them. When
LAkitcine sawthese children hebegantomaltreat hiswife, andher
children jumped uponhimand killed him. Then theywentthrough
Alaska, killingoffharmful monsters. One ofthese, which was like

andtried tocross theStikine, buttheir sister, whowasmenstniant,
looked outatthem, andtheywereturned tostone.
OnetimewhileRaven wastraveling along hecame toasculpin who
claimed tobeolder than he,soheplaceditintheskywhere itstill is

Heinvited thesealpeopletoafeast, smeared their foreheads with

wanted tomarry another high-caste woman, butabirdnamed tsAgwa n
toldthepeople howhehadtreated hisfirstwifeandthey rejected
him. Going onfrom there, heturned anoldmannamed DAmnadji
intoahandsome youth, andtoldhimtomarrythegirl. Thismandid
so,butonthewayhome resumed hisproper shape. When hiswife s
people came tovisithim,hehadtoreceive them inhismiserable hovel
because nooneelsewould have an}Tthingtodowithhim.When he
went outafter water, however, hecame toanoldwoman atthehead

carried heroff,finally dropping hernaked. Shecame toanoldwoman
andobtained some foxskins. Shewasnow really afox,andlether
selfbekilled byherfather. Oncuttingthefoxopen, however, they
discovered hercopper ornaments, and laidherontopofthehouse,
when sherevived andbecame agreat shaman.
After thisR-aven changedhimself intoawoman, andmarried the
