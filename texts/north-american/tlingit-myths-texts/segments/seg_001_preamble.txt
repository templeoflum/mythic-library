same time asthematerial contained inthewriter spaper onthe
Social Condition, Beliefs, andLinguistic RelationshipoftheTlingit
Indians publishedintheTwenty-sixth Annual ReportoftheBureau.
Forfurther information regarding these peoplethereader isreferred
tothat paper,toKrause sTlinkit Indianer (Jena, 1885),Emmons
BasketryoftheTlingit Indians, Niblack sCoast Indians ofSouthern
Alaska andNorthern British Columbia, Ball sAlaska and itsResources,

mittee Appointed bytheBritish Association fortheAdvancement of
Science, toInvestigatetheNorthwestern Tribes ofCanada, andthe
twospecial reports onAlaska forthecensuses of1880and 1890.
Most oftheethnologic information contained intheworks ofVenia-
minoff andother earlywriters isincorporatedintothework ofKrause.
Stories7,19,94,101,102,and103were related bythewriter sSitka
interpreter, DonCameron, oftheChilkat KagwAntan;stories 96and97

MYTHS RECORDED INENGLISH ATSITKA
1.RAVENa
Nooneknowsjusthow thestoryofRavenreally begins,soeach
starts from thepoint where hedoesknow it.Here itwasalways
beguninthisway. Raven was first called Kit-kaositiyi-qa-yit
(&quot;Son ofKit-kaositiyi-qa&quot;). When hissonwasborn, Kit-kaositiyi-
qatried toinstruct himandtrainhimineverywayand, afterhegrew
up,toldhimhewould givehimstrength tomake aworld. After
tryinginallsorts ofwaysRavenfinally succeeded. Then there
wTasnolightinthisworld, but itwastoldhimthat faruptheNass
wasalarge house inwhich some onekept light justforhimself.
Raven thought over allkinds ofplansforgettingthislight into
theworld andfinally hehitonagoodone. Therichmanlivingthere
hadadaughter, andhethought,&quot;Iwillmake myself very small and
dropintothewater intheform ofasmallpieceof dirt.&quot; Thegirl
swallowed thisdirtandbecame pregnant. When hertimewascom
pleted, theymade ahole forher,aswascustomary,inwhich shewas
tobring forth, andlined itwith richfurs ofallsorts. Butthechild
didnotwish tobebornonthose finethings. Then itsgrandfather
feltsadand said, &quot;What doyouthink itwould bebest toputinto
that hole? Shallweputinmoss?&quot; Sotheyputmoss inside and
thebabywasbom on it. Itseyeswere very bright andmoved
aroundrapidly.
Round bundles ofvarying shapes andsizeshung about onthewalls
ofthehouse. When thechildbecame alittlelargeritcrawled around
back ofthepeople weeping continually, andasitcried itpointedto
thebundles. This lasted many days. Then itsgrandfather said,
&quot;Givemygrandchild what heiscryingfor.Givehimthatonehang
ingontheend. That isthebagof stars.&quot; Sothechild played with
this, rollingitabout onthefloorback ofthepeople,until suddenly
helet itgoupthroughthesmoke hole. Itwent straight upinto
theskyandthestars scattered outofit,arranging themselves as
younow seethem. That waswhat hewent there for.
Some time after thishebegan crying again, andhecried somuch
that itwasthought hewould die .Then hisgrandfather said,&quot;Untie
thenextoneandgiveitto him.&quot; Heplayed andplayed with it
around behind hismother. After awhile heletthatgoupthrough
thesmoke hole also,andtherewasthebigmoon.

Nowjustonethingmore remained, theboxthatheldthedaylight,
andhecried forthat. Hiseyesturned around andshowed different
colors, andthepeople began thinkingthathemust besomething
other thananordinary baby. But italways happensthatagrand
father loves hisgrandchild justashedoes hisown-daughter,sothe
grandfather said,&quot;Untie thelastthing andgiveitto him.&quot; His
grandfatherfeltverysadwhen hegavethistohim.When thechild
had this inhishands, heuttered theravencry, &quot;Ga,&quot; andflewout
with itthroughthesmoke hole. Then theperson fromwhom hehad
stolen itsaid,&quot;That oldmanuring raven hasgottenallofmy things.&quot;
Journeying on,Raven wastold ofanotherplace, where amanhad
aneverlasting springofwater. Thismanwasnamed Petrel (GAnu k).
Raven wanted thiswater because there wasnone todrink inthis
world, butPetrel always sleptbyhisspring, andhehadacover over
itsoastokeepitalltohimself. ThenRaven came inandsaid to
him, &quot;My brother-in-law, Ihavejustcome toseeyou.How are
you?&quot; Hetold Petrel ofallkinds ofthingsthatwerehappening
outside, tryingtoinduce him togoouttolook atthem, butPetrel
wastoosmart forhimandrefused.
When night came, Ravensaid,&quot;Iamgoingtosleep with you,
brother-in-law.&quot; Sotheywent tobed,andtoward morning Raven
heard Petrelsleeping very soundly. Then hewent outside, took
some dogmanure andputitaround Petrel sbuttocks. When itwas
beginningtogrow light, hesaid,&quot;Wakeup,wakeup,wakeup,brother1
in-law, youhave defecated alloveryourclothes.&quot; Petrel gotup,
looked athimself, andthoughtitwas true, sohetook hisblankets
andwent outside. ThenRaven went over toPetrel sspring, took off
thecover andbegan drinking. After hehaddrunk upalmost allof
thewater, Petrel came inandsawhim. ThenRaven flewstraight
up,crying&quot;Ga.&quot;
Before hegotthroughthesmoke hole, however, Petrelsaid, &quot;My
spirits upthesmoke hole, catch him.&quot; SoRaven stuck there, and
Petrel putpitchwood onthefireunder himsoastomake aquantityof
smoke. Raven waswhite before that time, butthesmoke madehim
ofthecoloryoufindhimto-day.Stillhedidnotdrop thewater.
When thesmoke-holespiritslethimgo,heflewaround thenearest
point andrubbed himself allover soastoclear offasmuch ofthesoot
aspossible.
Thishappened somewhere about theNass,andafterwards hestarted
upthisway.First heletsome water fallfrom hismouth andmade
theNass. Byandbyhespitmore outandmade theStikine. Next
hespitoutTakuriver, then Chilkat, thenAlsek, and alltheotherlarge
rivers. Thesmall drops thatcame outofhismouth made thesmall
salmon creeks.

After thisRaven went onagain andcame toalargetown where
were people whohadnever seendaylight. They were outcatching
eulachon inthedarkness when hecame tothebankopposite, and
heasked them totakehimacross buttheywould not.Then hesaid
tothem,&quot;Ifyoudon tcome over Iwillhavedaylight break onyou.&quot;Butthey answered, &quot;Where areyoufrom? Doyoucome from
faruptheNasswhere lives themanwhohasdaylight?&quot; Atthis
Raven openedhisboxjustalittle andshed sogreat alight on
them thattheywerenearly thrown down. Heshut itquickly, but
they quarreled withhim somuch across thecreek thathebecame
angry andopened theboxcompletely, when thesunflewupintothe
sky. Then thosepeople whohad sea-otter orfur-sealskins, orthe
skins ofanyother seaanimals, went intotheocean, while thosewho
hadland-otter, bear, ormartenskins, ortheskins ofanyother land
animals, went intothewoods[becomingtheanimals whose skinsthey
wore].
Raven came toanotherplace where acrowd ofboyswerethrowing
fatatoneanother. When theyhithimwith apiece heswallowed
it.After awhile hetookdogsmanure andthrew attheboyswho
became scared, ranaway, andthrew more fatathim.Heconsumed
allinthisway,andstarted onagain.
After awhile hecame toanabandoned camp wherelayapieceof
jade (s!u) halfburied intheground, onwhich somedesign hadbeen
pecked. This liedugup.Faroutinthebayhesawalarge spring
salmon jumping about andwanted togetitbutdidnotknow how.
Then hestuck hisstone intotheground andputeagledownuponthe
head designed thereon. Thenexttime thesalmon jumped, hesaid,
&quot;See here, spring salmon jumping outthere, doyouknow what this
green stone issayingtoyou?Itissaying, Youthing withdirty,
filthy back, youthing withdirty, filthy gills,come ashore here.&quot;
Raven suddenly wanted todefecate andstarted off. Just then
thebigspring salmon alsostarted tocome ashore, soRaven said,
&quot;Just wait,myfriend, don tcome ashore yetforIhavesome business
toattend to.&quot; Sothesalmon went outagain. Afterward Raven
tookapieceofwildcelery (yanaet) ,and,when thesalmon didcome
ashore, hestruck itwith thisand killed it.Because Raven made
thisjadetalktothesalmon, people have sincemade stone axes, picks,
andspears outofit.
Then Raven, carrying alongthespring salmon, gotallkinds of
birds,littleandbig,ashisservants. When hecame toagood place
tocook hisfishhesaid toallofthem, &quot;Here, youyoung fellows, go
afterskunkcabbage. Wewillburythisintheground androast it.&quot;
Aftertheyhadbroughtitdown, however, hesaid,&quot;Idon twantany
ofthat.Mywifehasdefecated allover that, andIwillnotuse it.
Goback andpass overtwo mountains.&quot; While they were gone,


6 BUEEAU OFAMERICAN ETHNOLOGY [BULL. 39
Raven putallofthesalmon except onefatpiece cutfromaround the
&quot;navel&quot;awhich isusually cooked separately,intotheskunk cabbage
andburied itinthe fire. Before they returned, hedugthisupand
ateit,afterwhich heputthebones back intothe fireandcovered
them up.
When thebirds atlastcame back hesaid tothem,&quot;Ihavebeen
across twomountains myself. Now itistime todigitup.Digit
out.&quot; Then allcrowded around thefireanddug, but,whentheygot
itup,therewasnothing there butbones.
Byandbythebirds dressed oneanother indifferent wayssothat
theymight benamed from their dress. Theytiedthehair ofthe

Raven letoutthetsiegeniandtoldhimthatwhen thesalmon comes
hemust call itsslime unclean andstayhighupuntil thesalmon are
allgone.6
NowRaven started offwith thepieceofsalmonbellyandcame to
aplace where Bearand hiswife lived. Heentered andsaid, &quot;My
aunt sson,isthisyou? Thepieceofsalmon hehadburied behind
alittlepoint.ThenBear toldhimtositdown andsaid,&quot;Iwillroast
somedrysalmon foryou.&quot; Sohebegantoroast it.After itwasdone,
hesetadish close tothe fireand slittheback ofhishands with a
knife soastoletgreaserunoutforRaven toeatonhissalmon.
After hehadfixed thesalmon, hecutapieceofflesh outfrom in
front ofhisthighs andputitintothedish. That iswhy bears are
notfatinthatplace.
NowRaven wanted togiveadinner toBear inreturn, sohe,too,
took outapieceoffish,roastedit,setoutthedishBearhadused,
close tothefireand slituptheback ofhishand, thinkingthatgrease
would runoutofit.Butinstead nothing butwhite bubbles came
forth. Althoughheknew hecould notdoit,hetried inevery way.
ThenRaven asked Bear,&quot;Doyouknow ofanyhalibutfishing
groundout here?&quot; Hesaid &quot;No.&quot; Ravensaid, &quot;Why! what isthe
useofstaying herebythissaltwater,ifyoudonotknow ofanyfishing

ByandbyRaven gotthepieceoffishhehadhidden behind the

Cormorant satinthebow,Bear inthemiddle, and,because heknew
where thefishing ground was,Raven steered. When they arrived

After awhileRaven said toCormorant,&quot;There isalousecoming
down ontheside ofyour head. Come here. Letmetake it off.&quot;
When hecame close tohim,hepickeditoff.Then hesaid, &quot;Open
yourmouth sothat Icanputitonyour tongue.&quot; When hedidopen
hismouth, however, Raven reached farbackandpulledhistongue out.
Hedidthisbecause hedidnotwantCormorant totellabout what he
haddone. HetoldCormorant tospeak, butCormorant made onlya
gabblingnoise. &quot;That ishowyoungfellows oughttospeak/said
Raven. ThenRaven towed thedeadbodyofthebearbehind the
point andcarried itashore there. Afterwards hewent toBear swife
andbegantotake out hishalibut. Hesaid tothefemalebear,
&quot;Myfather ssister, cutout allthestomachs ofthehalibut androast
them.&quot; Soshewentdown onthebeach tocutthem out. While
shewasworking ontherest ofthehalibut, hecooked thestomachs
and filledthem withhotrocks. Then hewentdown andsaidtoher,
&quot;You better come up.Ihave cooked allthose stomachs foryou.
Youbetter washyour hands, come up,and eat.&quot; After thatCormo
rantcame inand tried totellwhat hadhappened butmade only a
gabbling sound. Raven said tothebear,&quot;Doyouknow what that
fellow istalking about ?He issayingthat there were lotsofhalibut
outwhere wefished. Every timewetried togetacanoe loadthey
almost turned us over.&quot; When shewasabout toeathesaid, &quot;People

began sheasked Raven where herhusband was,andRaven said,
lSomehow orother hecaught nothing,sowelanded himbehind the

thereyet.&quot;
After thebearhadswallowed allofthefood shebegantofeel

quickly andgethersome water.&quot; Then shedrank agreat quantity

him,buthesaid, &quot;Keep away, yousmallCormorant,&quot; andstruck
himonthebuttocks with hishand saying,&quot;Gooutandstayonthose
rocks.&quot; Ever since then thecormorants have been there. Raven
stayedinthatplaceuntil hehadconsumed both ofthebears.
Starting onagain, Raven came toaplace wheremany people were
encamped fishing. They usednothing butfatforbait.Heentered
ahouse andasked whi*t they used forbait. Theysaid &quot;Fat.&quot;
Then hesaid,&quot;Letmeseeyouputenough onyourhooks forbait,&quot;
andhenoticed carefully howthey baited andhandled their- hooks.
Thenexttimetheywent out,hewalked offbehind apoint andwent
under water togetthis bait.Now they gotbites andpulled up
quickly,buttherewasnothing ontheir hooks. Thiscontinued fora
longtime. Thenexttimetheywent outtheyfeltthething again,
butonemanamong themwhoknewjusthow fishbite, jerkedatthe
rightmoment and feltthathehadcaught something. The linewent
around inthewater veryfast. They pulled away, however, until
they gotRaven under thecanoe, andhekickedagainstitvery hard.
Allatonce hisnosecameoff,andthey pulleditup.Whenthey
landed, theytook ittothechief shouse andsaid,&quot;Wehavecaught a
wonderfulthing.Itmust bethenose oftheGonaqAdet.&quot;Sothey
tookit,puteagledown onit,andhungituponthewall.
After that,Raven came ashore attheplace where hehadbeen in
thehabit ofgoing down, gotalotofspruce gumandmade anew
noseoutofit.Then hedrew aroothatdown over hisfaceandwent
tothetown. Beginning atthenearer endhewent through the
housessaying&quot;Iwonder inwhat house arethepeople whocaught

thechief shouse andinquired,&quot;Doyouknow where arethepeople

Going thence, Raven saw anumber ofdeerwalking around on
thebeach, with agreat deal offathanging outthrough their noses.
Ashepassed oneofthese, hesaid, &quot;Brother, youbetter blowyour
nose. Lots ofdirt ishanging outof it.&quot;When thedeerwould not

NowRaven formed acertainplan. Hegotasmall canoe and

yourself, AxkwA iJi.&quot;ByandbyRaven said&quot;Notveryfarfrom here
myfather hasbeenmaking acanoe. Letusgothereandlook at it.&quot;
ThenRaven brought him toalarge valley. Hetookverymany
piecesofdried wildcelery and laidthem across thevalley, covering
them with moss. SaidRaven,&quot;AxkwAiJi,watch me,AxkwAiJi,
watch me.&quot; Repeatingthisoverandoverhewentstraight across on
it,forheislight. Afterwards hesaid toDeer,&quot;AxkwAiJi,now
youcome andtryit. Itwillnotbreak,&quot; andhecrossed oncemore.
&quot;You bettertryitnow,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Come on over.&quot; Deer didso,
but, ashewasontheway, hebroke throughthebridge andsmashed
hishead topiecesatthebottom. ThenRaven went down, walked
alloverhim,andsaid tohimself,&quot;Iwonder where Ibetter start, at
theroot ofhistail,attheeyes,oratthe heart.&quot; Finally hebeganat
hisanus, skinningashewentalong. Heateveryfast.
When hestarted onfrom thisplace, hebegan crying,&quot;AxkwAiJi-i-i,
AxkwAiJi-I-I,&quot; andthefowls asked him,&quot;What hasbecome ofyour
friend, AxkwA iJi?&quot; &quot;Some onehastakenhimandpounded himon

he died.&quot;
Byandbyhecame toacertain cliffandsawadoor initswing

Raven sawsomekelp, and,going outtothis,heclimbed down onitto

again said,&quot;Onwhat tide didyougetthose seaurchins youare

Sheanswered &quot;Yes.&quot; Because Raven didthiswhile hewasmaking

After thetidehadgonedown veryfarheandhisservant went out.
HesaidtoMink,&quot;Thethingthat willbeyourfoodfromnowonisthe

NowRaven started onfrom thisplace crying, &quot;My wife,mywife!&quot;
Comingtosome trees, hesawalotofgumononeofthemandsaid to

After thishegotacanoe andbegan paddling along. Byandby
Petrel methiminanother canoe. Sohebroughthiscanoealongside

Heanswered,&quot;Iamfrom over there.&quot; ThenRaven began toques

&quot;When wereyouborn?&quot; &quot;Iwasborn before thisworld was known.&quot;
&quot;That isjustalittle while back.&quot;
Theytalked backandforth untiltheybecame very angry. Then
Petrel pushed Raven scanoe away fromhimandputonhishat

SaidRaven, &quot;I,i.&quot;Hedidnot like itatall. After Petrel had

Leavingthisplace, Raven came toanother where hesawsome
thing floating notfarfromshore, thoughitnever came anynearer.
Heassembled allkinds offowl. Towardevening helooked atthe
object andsawthat itresembled fire. Sohetoldachicken hawk
(kA!ku

chicken hawk reached theplace, seized some fireandstarted back
asfastasitcouldfly,butbythetime itgotthe firetoRaven its
billwasburned off.That iswhyitsbill isshort. Then Raven
tooksome redcedar, andsome white stones calledneq!which are
found onthebeach, andheputfireintothem sothat itcould be
found everafterward allover theworld.
After hehad finisheddistributing the firehestarted onagain
andcame toatown where there weremany people. Hesawwhat

Afterward hewent tothemiddle ofthetown andsaid,&quot;Iam

tobeatdrums. Then heheld thecane inhishands andmoved it
aroundhorizontally, testingit.Hekeptsaying &quot;Up, up, up.&quot;aHe
said,&quot;Ihave never given anyfeast formymother, and itistime I
didit,butIhave nothing withwhich togive afeast. Therefore I
made thiscane, and Iamgoing togiveafeast formymother with

Then hegotthepeoplealldown onthebeach andextended his

After thiswasoverhethought upaplotagainst thekiller whales
andsentaninvitation tothem. Then hetoldeach ofhispeople
tomake acane thatwould reach verymuch above hishead. So,
when thekiller whales came inandinquired,&quot;What dothepeople
usethose canes forthatextend upover theirheads?&quot;, hereplied,
&quot;Theystickthemdown intotheir heads.&quot; They asked himseveral
times, andhereplied each time inthesameway. After awhile
oneofthewhales said, &quot;Suppose wetryit.&quot;Raven wasgladto
hear thatandsaid,&quot;Allright,wewilltryitwithyoupeople, but
thepeopleIhave invited must notlookwhen Iputacane into
anyoneshead.&quot; Then hewent away andwhittled anumber of
sticks untiltheywerevery sharp. After thathelaid allofthekiller
whales onthebeach atshort distances apart, andagain hetoldthem
nottolookupwhile hewasshowing onehow itwasdone. Then he
took ahammer ormaulanddrove hissticks intothenecks ofthese
whales oneafter theother sothattheydied. Butthelastone
happened tolookup,sawwhatwasbeing done, andjumped intothe
ocean.
a[NowRaven andanother personstarted toboiloutthekiller-

dreamed adream which informed himthat alotofpeople were

themanreturned, threwRaven intoagrease box,andshuthimin,
andstarted totie itupwith astrong rope. ThenRaven called
out,&quot;Mybrother, donot tietheboxupvery strongly. Tie itwith a
pieceofstraw such asourforefathers used to use.&quot; Theman did
so,afterwhich hetook theboxuponahighcliffandkicked itover.
ThenRaven, breaking thestraw, flewout,cryingGa.&quot;When hegot
totheother sideofthepoint, healighted andbegan wiping himself.]
Next hecame toalargewhale biowing along outatsea,andnoticed
thatevery time itcame up,itsmouth waswide open. ThenRaven
took aknife andsomething withwhich tomake fire.When the
whale cameupagain heflew into itsmouth and satdown atthe
farther endofitsstomach. Near theplacewhere hehadentered he
sawsomething thatlooked likeanoldwoman. Itwasthewhale s
uvula (Anu t!ayi). When thewhale came up,itmade abignoise, the
uvula went toonesideandtheherring andother fish itlivedon
poured rightin.ThenRaven began eatingallthese things thatthe
whale hadswallowed, and, presently, hemade afiretocook thefat
ofthewhale itself thathunginside. Last ofallheatetheheart.
Assoon ashecutoutthis, thewhale threw itself about inthewater
andsoon floated updead. Raven felt thisandsaid,&quot;Iwisli it

many times, thewhale begantodriftalong, and itfinally floated
ashore onalongsandy beach.
After awhilesomeyoung fellows whowerealways shooting about
inthisneighborhood with theirbows andarrows, heard avoice on
thebeachsay,&quot;Iwonder who willmake aholeonthetopsothat

&quot;We heard aqueernoise. Something floated ashore notfarfrom
thisplace, andapersoninsidesaid, Iwish thatsomebody would

assembled around thewhale andheard Raven swords very clearly.
They begantocutaholejustover theplace thesecame fromand
presently theyheard some oneinsidesay,&quot;Xone -e.&quot;When thehole
waslarge enough, Raven flewstraight upoutofituntilhewas lost
tosight. Andtheysaid tohim, &quot;Fly toanyplace where youwould
liketogo.&quot; After thatthey cutthewhale upandincourse oftime
came tothespotwhere Raven hadlightedhisfiretomake oil.
Meanwhile Raven flewback oftheircamptoalarge dead tree
thathadcrumbled into finepieces andbegan rubbing onittodry
himself. When hethought that thepeople were through making
oil,hedressed himself upwellandrepairedtothetown. There he
said tothepeople,&quot;Was anything heard inthat tclan (hisword for
whale)?&quot; andoneanswered, &quot;Yes, aqueernoisewasheard inside
ofthe whale.&quot; &quot;Iwonder what itwas,&quot; saidRaven.
After their foodwas allprepared Raven said tothepeople, &quot;Long
ago,when asound washeard inside ofatclan,allthepeople moved
out oftheir town soasnot tobekilled. Allwhoremained
were destroyed. Soyou better move from this town.&quot; Then all
ofthepeople said,&quot;All ofusbetter move from thistown rather
than bedestroyed.&quot; Sotheywent offleavingalloftheirthings,
andRaven promptly took possessionofthem.
Raven oncewent toacertainplaceoutside ofhere (Sitka) inhis
canoe. Itwascalm there, buthebegan rockingthecanoe upand

thepresent time, people have differed intheir opinions concerning
themonths andhave disputed withoneanother.
After theyhadquarreledover itforalong time, thegullbecame
angry,flewouttosea,andbrought back abigherring. Helighted
nearRaven and laidtheherringbeside him, but,whenRaven tried
toget it,hegulpeditdown. Inanother direction from theseagull
Raven sawalarge heron andwent over toit.Hesaid totheheron,
&quot;Seagulliscalling you Big-long-legs-always-walking-upon-the

theseagullandsaid,&quot;Doyouknowwhat thatheron issaying about
you? Hesaysthatyouhave abigstomach andgetyour redeyes

andIwillhelpyouthrash him.&quot; Sotheheron went overtoward the
seagull, and,when hecame close toit,Raven said,&quot;Kick himjust
under his stomach.&quot; Hedidso,and thebigherring came out.
ThenRaven swallowed itquickly saying,&quot;Just forthe Raven.&quot;
Going onagain, Raven came toacanoe inwhich weresome people
lying asleep along with abigsalmon which hetook away. When
thepeople awoke, theysawthetrailwhere hehaddraggeditoff,and
they followed him. They found himlying asleep bythe fireafter
having eaten thesalmon. Seeinghisgizzard hanging outathisbut
tocks, they twisted itoff,ranhome with itandused itasashinny
ball; this iswhynohuman beingnowhasagizzard.
Thepeople knew itwasRaven sgizzard,sothey liked toshow it

nowusedried salmon anddonotcaremuch forsalmoneggs.
Journeying on,Raven came toasealsitting ontheedgeofarock,
andhewanted toget it,butthesealjumped intotheocean. Then
hesaid, &quot;Y&kloGtU/Lf,&quot; because hewassosorry about it.Farther
onhecame toatownandwent behind ittowatch. After awhile a
mancame out,took alittle clubfrom acertainplace where hekept
itinconcealment, andsaid toit, &quot;Mylittle club, doyouseethat

little sealashore. Theclubwashangingtoitsneck. Then theman
took itupand said, &quot;Mylittle club,youhave donewell,&quot; after
which heputitback initsplace andreturned tothetown. Raven
sawwhere itwaskept, but firsthewent tothetown andspoke
kindlytotheowner ofit.Inthenight, however, whenevery onewas

andgetit.&quot;Buttheclubwould notgobecause itdidnotknow him.
After hehadtried togetittogoforsome time, hebecame angry and
said toit,&quot;Little club,don tyouseethat sealout there?&quot; Hekept
strikingitagainst arock until hebroke itinpieces.
Comingtoalarge bay,Raven talked toitinorder tomake itinto
Nass (i.e.,hewanted tomake itjustliketheNass), but,wlien the
tidewasoutgreatnumbers ofclams ontheflatsmade somuch noise
shooting upathimthat hisvoice wasdrowned, andhecould not

Aftermany attempts, hegaveitupandwentaway saying,&quot;Itried

Two brothers started tocross theStikine river, butRaven saw
themand said,&quot;Bestones there.&quot; Sotheybecame stones.
Starting on,hecame totheground-hog, peopleo.nthemainland.
Hismother haddiedsome time before this, and, ashehadnopro

When thetidebegantofall,allthepeople followed itdown, but
thetreesweregoneandtheyhadnothingtouseasfirewood, sotheyweredestroyed bythecold.When Raven camebackfromunder the
earth,ifhesawafish leftontopofamountain orinacreek, hesaid,
&quot;Stay right thereandbecome astone.&quot; Soitbecame astone. Ifhe
sawanyperson coming down, hewouldsay,&quot;Turn toastonejust
where you are,&quot;and itdidso.
After that theseawentdown sofarthat itwasdryeverywhere.ThenRaven went aboutpicking upthesmallestfish, asbullheads
and torncod,which hestrung onastick, while afriend whowas
withhim atthistime,named CAkUkvtooklarge creatures like
whales. With thegrease heboiledout,CAkU k11filled anentire
house, whileRaven filledonlyasmall bladder.
Raven stayed withCAklA k11andonenight hadadream. Hesaid
tohisfriend,&quot;Idreamed thatagreatenemy cameandattacked us.&quot;
Then hehad allthefowls assemble andcome tofight,sothat his
dream might befulfilled. Assoon asRaven had told hisdream,
CAklA k&quot;wentdown andsawthebirds. ThenRaven went intothe
house andbegan drinking uphisgrease. Butthemancameback,
sawwhatRaven wasdoing, andthrew himintoagrease box,which
hestarted totieupwith astrong rope. Raven, however, calledout,
&quot;My brother, donot tiemeupwith astrong rope, buttake astraw

drank upallthegreaseinthebox,and,when themantookhimupon

OnetimeRaven assembled allthebirds inpreparationforafeast
andhadthebears intherear ofhishouse asguests.Allthebirdshad

throughalltheworld insearch ofthingstoeat.
After allthehuman beings hadbeen destroyed Raven madenew
ones outofleaves. Because hemade thisnewgeneration, people
know thathemusthavechangedallofthefirstpeople whohadsur

leaves people alwaysdieoffrapidlyinthefalloftheyearwhen flowers
andleaves arefalling.
Atthetimewhen hemade thisworld, Raven made adevilfish
digging-stick andwent around toallcreatedthings (shellfish appar

either yesor no.&quot; Those that said &quot;No&quot; hepassed by;those that
said &quot;Yes&quot; herootedup.Hesaid tothepeople,&quot;When thetide

InRaven stime thebutts offerns (klwAlx) werealready cooked,
but, aftersomewomen hadbroughtseveral ofthesein,Raven broke a
stick overthefernroots. Therefore theybecamegreenlikethisstick.
Healsobroke therootsupintomany layers oneabove another.
Devilfish wereveryfatthen,andthepeople used tomakegrease out
ofthem, but,whenRaven came toaplace where theyweremaking
hesaid,&quot;Givemeapieceofthathardthing.&quot; That iswhyitsfat

3.ENGLISH VERSION OFTHESTORY OFTHEFOUR

There were four brothers whoowned adogofanAthapascan

paintinside ofhisblanket, took hisrattle, andfollowed. Theother
brothers went with him. They pursueditup,up,up,intothesky.
Thedogkeptonbarking, andtheydidnotknow what itwasgoing

When theygottotheother side oftheworld theycame outonthe

however, wentrightdown thecliff,andtheysawthecloud stillgoing

Then theysaid tooneanother, What shallwedo?Wemightas

started hewassmashed inpieces. Thetwonext fared inthesame
way. KAck !ArLk!,however, braced hisstickagainst thewallbehind
himandreached thebottom insafety. Then heputthebones of
each ofhisbrothers together, rubbed redpaint onthem, andshook
hisrattle overthem, andtheycame tolife.
Starting onagain around thisworld, theycame toacreek fullof
salmon. Thiswaswhere thedoghadbeen before. When they got

They hadhim sitbelow because hetalked somuch, andbecause he

That nighttheone-legged man didnotsleepatallonaccount of

Then hecried,uBringmyspearthisway.&quot; Although hesawnoone,
heknew that there were peopletherewhohad it.Then hecame to

heserved thenexttwobrothers. ButKAckU/Lk! hadhisdog,which
hew^asable tomake small, concealed under hiscoat and, after his
brothers were torn up,helet itgo,and ittorethebigman allto

therattle overthem sothattheycame tolife.
Nextmorning they gotintothesame treeagain. Then theysaw
amanwithtwoheads placed oneoveranother coming upthestream.
Itwasthebear chief. Hehooked agreatmany salmon andputthem

hecould hooknone atall,soLqlaya/k! caughtalotforhim. Then
Lqlayak!asked him:uWhat does thatdouble-head thatcame up

Toward evening agreatdeal ofnoisewasheardoutside, made over

Then itrolledrightbackagain. When itrolled back, thedogbecame
very angry,seized itasecond time, shook ithard, andthrew itso

together, putredpaint uponthem andshook hisrattle overthem.
Theycame tolifeagain. Then hetook thedog,made itsmall, and
putitunder hisarm; andtheystarted off. Since thattime people
havehadthekind ofspear (dma )above referred to.Thebrothers
started onwithit,and,whenever theywere hungry, they gotfood
\vith it.They always kept together.
After awhile theycame across some Athapascan Indians called
Worm-eating people (Wun-xa qoan). These were sonamed because,
when theykilled game, theyletworms feedupon it,and,when the
worms hadbecomebigenough, theyatethem throughholes inthe
middle oftheir foreheads which served them asmouths. Lqlayak !
wanted tobeamongthese Athapascans, because theyhadbows and
arrows andworequillsattached totheir hair. They used theirbows
andarrows toshoot caribou, and,when theywerepursuingthisanimal,
theyused toeatsnow.
After Lqlaya/k! hadobtained hisbowandarrows theycame out
atacertainplace, probablytheStikineriver, andstayed among
somepeople whowerewhipping oneanother forstrength,inthesea.
Every morning theywent intothewater with them.
Atthattimetheythought thatLqlayak !wasgoing with hissister,
andtheyputsome spruce gumaround theplace where sheslept.
Then theyfound thespruce gumonhimandcalled him allsorts of

Youcanbeathunder(hex!).&quot; They said tohim, &quot;Ha/agun kadi .&quot;a
This iswhy,when thunder isheard, people always say,&quot;You

sisterwasashamed. Shewentdown intoMount Edgecumbe (L!UX)

Because thethunder isaman,when thethunder isheard farout

Hemade these ofdifferent sorts. Ononehemarked white lines

When hefirstputthem intothewater heheaded themuptheinlet,

theywere tohunt forseal, halibut, and allotherthings under the

Before thispeopledidnotknow what thekiller whale is.
Another thing peopledidnotknow wasthatthekiller whale could
goashore andcamp. Onetime amanmarried ahigh-caste woman
andwentuptothehead ofacertain baywith her,because heknew
that thekiller whales always went there. Onthewaytheysawa

here,buthethought theywerehuman beings andlanded toseethem.
When they gotclosein,hejumpedintothewater tourinate. All

whohadconcealed herself behind herhusband, andcarried herdown
tothesea.They tookheraway because herhusband hadtaken their
provisions.This time,when thekiller whales roseagain, instead of

thehusband wentdown tohiscanoe, gotin,andpaddledafterthem

9.WOLVERINE-MAN
There were people livinginacertain townonthemainland. You
know that inolden times thepeopledidnotuseguns. They hunted
withbowsandarrows, andhornspears, and itwasveryhardwork to
usethem. So,when theywere going hunting, theyhadtofastand
wash theirheads inurine. That iswhy inallofthese stories which I
amtelling youjust astheywere told intheolden times foodwas
very scarce andhard toget. Success depended onwhatthings were
usedandhowpeople prepared themselves.
Onedayacertain man atthisplace began preparing himself by
washinghishead inurine, andthefollowing morning hedressed and
started upthevalley carryinghishornspear. Atthehead ofthis
valley hesawaflock ofmountainsheep, buthecould notgetatthem,
sohecampedovernight. Inthemorning hesawthat awolverine
(nusk) wasamong these sheep killing them off.
Next evening hereached thetopofthemountain andstarted into
thebrush tocamp, butcame toahouse with thedoorwideopenfor
him.Ontheinside hung piecesoffatfrom allkinds ofanimals the
wolverine had killed. Hewanted togoinverymuch, butinstead he
satdown inthebrush nearbyandwaited.
Presently amancame along carrying apack. ThiswasWolverine-
man(Nusgu-qa). Hesaid, &quot;My trader, youarehere.Whydon t

hisclothes andbegan wringing them outjustlikeahumanbeing.
Then heheated some hotrocks, took hishalfbasket, chopped upthe
bones ofaground hogandputthese into italong with thecooking
stones. Then hesaidtotheman,&quot;GivemethatkAndALa x.Give
methatklAxA kaok.&quot; These were hisownwords which hewas
teachingtothisman,andtheymean, Givememydish. Givememy
littlespoon.&quot; So,when onewentuptothetopofthismountain in
olden times hecalled hisdishes andspoons bythose names.

ThenWolverine-man placed thefoodbefore hisguest, but,when the
latter wasabout totakesome, Wolverine-man saidsomething that
sounded strangetohim.Hesaid,&quot;There heispickingitup.There

&quot;He isgettingcloser tothesmall bones. He isgetting closer tothe
small bones. He isgettingcloser tothesmall brother ofthebig

didnotwant theman toeatthesmall bones atthejoint/ and itwas
fromWolverine-man thatpeople learned nottoeatthese. Hesaid,
&quot;Iamnotsayingthis toyoubecause Ihate you.Ifanybody
swallows these, theweather isnotclearontopofthemountain. It
isalways foggy, andonecan killnothing. This iswhyIamtelling
you.&quot; Meanwhile thepeopleinthecamps hunted every dayforthis
manbutinvain.
ByandbyWolverine-man said tohim,&quot;Goaround totheother
side ofthemountain and sitdown where theground-hogs placesare.&quot;
Hewent there every day,butalways camehome without anything.
Wolverine-man, however, brought him agreat load every time.
Finally Wolverine-man toldhimtogoandcutofftwosmall limbs with
hisax.People generallycarried astone axwhen offhunting. With
these hemade atrapforhimandnamed itNever-lasting-over-night
(Lanka/klixe). Itwassonamed because itwascertain tocatch.
When theywentupnext day,Wolverine-man said,&quot;Iamgoing

Hesetitupmany times, andeachtimehecaughtone.Hekilled four
that day. That iswhy thetrapiscalled Never-lasting-over-night.
From thattimeonheincreased thesizeofhiscatch every day,while
Wolverine-man didnotcatch much. When hegothome with allhis
ground hogsWolverine-man laydownbythefireandbegan singing,
&quot;What Iwould have killed has allgoneover toalazyman sside.&quot;
Next morning, when theyagainstarted offtohunt, Wolverine-man,
instead ofcontinuing onhisusual route, came back toseewhat his
companion wasdoing. Then heclimbed into atree towatch him,
begantoplayaround inthetree,andafterwards suddenlyfelldown.
Hewanted todeceive thetrapper.This tree isa-small bushy one
called S!AX,and itisWolverine-man swifewithwhich hehadreally
been cohabiting. Theman, however, observed what hewasdoing,
andreturned home atonce,upon which Wolverine-man became so
ashamed thathelaydown andcovered himself with ashes.
After thatWolverine-man told hisguesttoliedown andcover

Now theman arose and said toWolverine-man,&quot;Iamgoing

where hehadbeenbuttokeephiminremembrance bymeans ofthe

when hewentdown, hehadabigpackofskins.
Then hebegantodistribute these toallhisfriends, telling them that
hehaddiscovered aplacewhere therewere lotsofthings, andthathe
hadatrapwhich never failed tokillground hogsandother animals if
setonthemountain overnight. When heexplainedtothepeople
how tosetupthistrap,amannamed Coward (QlAtxa n)said,&quot;I

placewhere Wolverine-man hadhelped himbutintooneofthelower
valleys where thereweremany ground hogs. There theyconstructed
ahouse outofdrysticks andbegan trapping. Coward hadunder

11.STORIES OFTHEMONSTER DEVILFISH AND
THECRY-BABY6
Many people oncewent toacertain camptodrysalmon. They
didnotknow thatabigdevilfish livedunder asteepcliffnotvery
farfrom thisplace.Inolden times, besides using hooks, theycaught
salmon bymeans oftraps (CA!), andwhen thetrapwasfull,they
would take outthefishandhangthem ondryingframes. When
these people hadmanyfishontheframes, theytook offtheir covers
sothat theredcolor shone outontheocean very distinctly.
Amanandhistwobrotherslivingatthiscamp werefond ofhunt
ing,andoneday,when verymany salmon wereontheframes, they
started out. While theywere gonethedevilfish sawtheglow on
thewater from theredsalmon, threw histentacles around thecamp
andswept every vestigeofitintothesea. Inthose times ahunter
washed inurine before going outhunting andwasthen sure tokill
something, butonthatdayeverythingthehunters speared got
away. When they returned tothecamp, theysawmany piecesof
canoesdrifting about thebay. Then theywereverysadonaccount
ofthelossoftheir friends, buttheydidnotknowwhathaddestroyed
them.
After theyhadremained there forfourdays, theytoldtheyoungest
toclimb tothetopofahighhillandwatch them. Then theeldest
told hisother brother tocutfouryoung spruce trees, andhesharp
ened these, making two forhimself andtwoforhisbrother. Early
inthemorning theyloaded their canoe with rocks andpreparedto
meet thedangerous animal. They went outinfront ofthehigh
cliffandbegan throwing rocks clown there, theelder sayingtohis
youngest brother,&quot;Look down.&quot;
After awhile theysawthelargedevilfish coming upright under
them. Then theytook thesharpenedsticks andbegantopierceits
flesh. Theyoungest watched allthathappened. When theircanoe
wasbroken up,theyclimbed ontopofthedevilfish andcontinued
runningthesticks into ituntil itdied.When thathappenedit
carried themdownalong with it.
Then theyoungest brother started offtofindsome settlement, and
when hecame toone, thepeoplesetoutatonce tolook forhis
brothers.Finally they discovered theplacetowhich thedevilfish
hadfloated, along with thehunters and their canoe. But itdid

15.BEAVER ANDPORCUPINE
Aporcupine andabeaver were onceveryclose friends.6They
traveled about everywhere andreportedtoeach other allthat

16.THEPOORMANWHOCAUGHT WONDERFUL THINGS
There wasalongtown fromwhich allthepeople used togoout
fishingforhalibut andotherlargefishevery day. Inthose times,
before bonewasused, theymade hooks oftwopiecesofspruce from
young trees, sharpenedthepoint andhardened itinthe fire. For
linesthey dried slenderkelpstems.
Averypoormanlivingatoneendofthetown fished among the

17.THEFINDING OFTHEBLUE PAINT, ANDHOWA
CERTAIN CREEK RECEIVED ITSNAME
AtSitka lived fourbrothers whowere veryfond ofhunting. In
those days peopleliked tohunt about thestraits north ofSitka for
furseals, seaotters, etc.Oneday, while theywere out,theywere
forced totakerefuge from astorm ataplace nearMount Edgecumbe,
called Town-on-the-inside-of-blue-paint-point (Nexi ntaiataq !-an) ,
andwhile hunting about thisplace duringtheir long staytheydis
covered arocky cave oroverhangingclifffromwhich softblue stuff
continually dropped. Theyoungest said,&quot;Ihave discovered aval
uable thing which willbeused forpainting andforeverything carved.&quot;
After theyhadbeen there foralongtime theweather became fine
andtheseasmooth. Now inolden timespeople knew thateverything
wasdangerous. When thebrothers were about tostart, they said,
&quot;Wewilltakesome offnow tocarryhome.&quot; Sotheyknocked offa

Would itnotbebetter tothrow this bluepaintinto thewater ?

They were notdrowned; however, andreached shore insafety,so

Foralongtime after thebrothers reached shore with thisblue

After thepeoplehadworked awayforsome time, thetrench was

thewoman totellherpeopletohavepityonthemandnotdestroy all,

thewater flowed out,carrying numbers offrogs which scattered in

Then theycame withhim toFort-by-small-lake (Ak!uNu), just
west ofJuneau, and built abighouse forhimwith inside rooms
(t!aq!), corner andmiddleposts, thelastmentionedbeing carved to
represent theGreat Dipper (YAxte ).Atthat time theshaman
fasted forfourdaysandYAxte (theconstellation) appeared tohim.
Sofrom thathouse thepeople were called YAxte -hit-tan (Wain-
Housepeople).
Themountain-sheep tribegave thismanthename ofSkowadAl,and
hewas also called CAxtca/tc(Long-toothed-humpback). When his
spiritwasabout towork inhim,twoporcupine bladders wereblown
upandhunginthehouse, and,when thespirit arrived,allstoodupin
thecustomary way. Then heputonhismask and hissnowshoes,
which werethrown down onthefloor forhim,andcarried hisbowand
arrows inhishand. Although hecould notseethrough thismask, he
climbed uponthewalls oftheinside rooms andranaround there
backward. While there heshot atabladder andthearrow passed
straight throughit.

down before itandwascaught and killed. Then theothersquickly
speared thebearthrough andthrough andkilled it.
Meanwhile aspiritcame totheshaman, whohadremained athome,
saying,&quot;Your friend hasbeen killed byabear.&quot; They brought the

Some time afterward heagain began testinghisspirits, because
theywere going south towar, and,when theylefthim,hetold his
people thattheywould destroy anentire town.

When they tested himathespirit said,&quot;Allpeople onsticks,&quot; meaning
that itwanted alloftheir foestofallonsticks andbedestroyed when

alittle while afterward thefortpeople said,&quot;Where isthatmanwho

they rushed together onbothsides, and allthose inthefortwere
destroyed justastheshaman hadpredicted. Then theyreturned to
theirown fort,which wasalsoknown asEulachon-trap fort(Calnu).
Another time fivewomen went around theisland where theyhad
their fort, after mussels, andcame toareefontheouter side. They
lefttheir canoe untied and itfloated away. Then thetidebeganto

27.THEALSEK RIVER PEOPLE
Once therewasafamine among thepeopleofAlsek (Alse x)river.
There weretwoshamans there, oneofwhom began singingtobring
upeulachon, while theother sangforstrengthinorder toobtain
bears andother forest animals.
The firstshaman sspirittoldhimthat ifhewould godown the
littlerapids hewould seegreatnumbers ofeulachon. Sohedressed
upnextmorning andwent straight down under thewater inalittle
canoe.
That night theothershaman sspirits came tohim,saying thatthe
firstshaman would remain under water forfour nights; thathehad
goneintoahouse where were eulachon, salmon, andother fishand
hadthrown thedooropen.
Attheendoffourdaystheyhunted allaround andfound himlying
deadonthebeach amidpilesofeulachon. Assoon astheybrought
himup,alltheeulachon thatwere intheocean started torunup
river,andeveryonetried topreserveasmanyofthem ashecould.
Inthesame town weretwomenstruaiit women, andtheother
shaman toldthese thattherewould beagreatmany land otters about
thetown thatevening. Just ashehadsaid, atthetimewhen his
spirits came tohimthatevening, numbers ofland-otter-men came
through thevillage. They could beheardwhistling about thetown.
Finally some onesaid, &quot;Whyisitthat itsounds asiftheywere all
where thetwowomen are?&quot; Sureenough, theyfound thattheland
otters weretalking inside ofthetwowomen. Theones thatwere
inside ofthem werereally land-otter-men, thatis,menwhohadbeen
takenawaybytheland otters andmade likethemselves.
Aperson would oftencreepcloseuptothesewomen tofindout
what they were, butevery timesomething spoke outinside,&quot;Donot

These land-otter-men hadcome tothewomen toturnthem intoland-
otter-peoplealso.
Amenstruant woman istheonlything that willenfeeble thepower
ofashaman sspirit, therefore, although theshaman endeavored to
getthese land-otter-men outofthewomen, hisspirits kept turning
back. When theshaman sspiritcame tohimnextevening,itsaid
thatthereweremore land-otter-men comingtotakeaway theones in
thesewomen andthewomen withthem. Hetoldthepeopletobe
watchful, because there wasgoingtobeagreat disturbance that
night. When nightcameonthepeople were allverymuchfrightened
atthenoises theland-otter-men made under thehouses, andthey
hadgreat trouble keepingthetwowomen intheirrooms sothatthey
should notbecarried off. Allthepeople helped them, buttheland
otters were invisible. After thatnobody went outtocampfora
long time. Then they said tothetwowomen,&quot;Take yourbloody
clothes todifferent beaches, leave themthere, and telltheland
otters thattheyaretoogreat animals tofight withweakbeings.&quot;
Inthose times whenever amenstruant woman saidanythingofthat
kind ithadtobeobeyed. Sotheland otters went off.
Theshamans inthose times wereverystrict andstrong, andwhat
ever theysawwas true.Byandbythese shamans said,ltSome
thingisgoingtohappentothatgreattown therebythe lake.&quot; When
thethings thathadhappenedintheir neighbors townregardingthe
land otters were reportedtothepeople there, they said,&quot;Areyou
afraid ofthose things that stutter andcannottalk likeyouand I?&quot;
Byandbytwomen started hunting from thisplace. When they
hadreached thetopofaneighboring mountain, theylooked backand
sawagreatfloodcomedown between themountains andoverwhelm
their town. This floodwascaused byanavalanche which poured
intothelakeand filled itup,forcing thewater out.Somehuman
bodies were hangingtothebranches oftrees. Themenknew this
hadhappened onaccount ofthewaytheyhadspokenoftheland
otters, and, starting onaimlessly, theycame tothetown where the
shamans lived.
Oneofthesetwoshamans hadaquantityofoilwhich hewasgoing
tocarrytoanother town. Hewanted tobuyskins ofkinds different
from those hisownpeoplehad.When theyreached acamping place
outside ofthetown theman sspirittoldhimtogodown tothebeach

liked saltthings. There hesawavery bigdevilfish under arock,and
hisspiritsaid tohim,&quot;Look out,master, that isabiglive devilfish.&quot;
Assoon ashehadhookedit,hesawwhat appearedtobetwoducks
flying toward himfrom either side,buttheywere reallythedevilfish s

hesquatted down there under arock, while thedevilfish stentacles
sweptoverhim, carryingalltheforest trees along withthem. Two
daysafter thishisspirittoldhimtosetoutagain.
When thisshaman arrived atKlAkAnuwu,wheremany people lived,
everybody wanted toseehimandtryhisstrength, because theyhad
heard thathewasagreat shaman. Oneevening theybegan trying
him. They threw hismask onhisfaceand itstayed there, covering
uphiseyessothathecould notseewhere hewasgoing. Then,when
heranaround thefire,thepeoplestuck outtheir feettotriphim,but
hejumpedoverthem everytime. Thisshowed howstronghisspirits
were. Another time hisspirits came tohimthey built abigfireand
hestarted around it.Then hethrew the fireround upon everyone
whowasthereandashighupastheceiling, butthefirehurtnobody.
Byandbyhisclothes mansaid,&quot;Anotherspiritiscomingtohimsoon,
named Guts!caxot!qa.&quot;Thisspirit hadabigknife inhishand with
which hewould hitpeople onthebreast. When itcame tohim, the
shaman toldtheolderpeopletostandupstraight andmotionless and
nottofear, for ifonegotscared hewould die.Hehitone,andthey
laidhim inacertainplace. Then everyone said,&quot;You better kill
thatshaman,forhehasslain thebestman inthecompany.&quot; After
hisspirits hadgoneaway, however, theshaman went tothebody out
ofwhich blood was stillflowing andsaid,&quot;Itwillbeallright,&quot; while
hisspirits made anoise. Then theman gotupandjumped about.
Thepeoplelooked atthewoundedplace, buttherewasnotsomuch
asascaruponit.
After awhile theshaman began tradingoffhisgreasetoallwho
wanted it.Onedayhesaid, &quot;Somethingisabout tocomeupthat
willbeverydangeroustoyou people.&quot;Itwasthemoon. When the
moon cameupitshonebrightly, andthestarswere bright, butafter
atime themoon began tohide itsfacefrom them. Thatwaswhat
hehadpredicted. Thepeople, however, thoughtthiswascaused
bytheshaman himself.
Then theleading menandwomen oftheKagwAntan dressed them
selvesup,putgrease onthefire,andbegan dancingtodance themoon
out. After awhile itcame outjustalittle,sotheyfeltveryhappy
anddanced stillharder. They continued doingsountil thewhole
moon was out.Atthesame timepeople tookwhatever property
theyhad,held itupandcalled themoon for it.They saythemoon
actsinthiswaybecause itfeelspoorandlonely, so,when themoon
orsundoes thus, they actinthismanner. After thattheshaman
wenthome andtold hisfellow shaman howeveryone had triedhim
inthisplace.&quot;When Iwent around thefire,people putouttheir
feettomakemestumble. Theytriedmeinevery way.&quot;
Theshaman leftathome wasalsotryingtoexert hispower. His
spirits were singinginside ofhim inorder tobring salmon intothe

creeks;andhetoldsomeone tomakehimaone-barbed hook (dina ).
Whenever thesalmon hewasaftercame hewasgoing tousethisin
order togetit.When itcameupitfilled thewhole ofAlsek river
andbroke allthehooks ofthosewho tried tocatch it.Then the
shaman selected asmall boyandsaid,&quot;This littleboyisgoing to
hook it.&quot; Sohegavehimthehook hehadhadmade, andthe little
boypulleditupeasily. Theshaman sspirits had killed it.This
salmon wassolarge that allinthattownhadashare, andeventhen
itwasmore thanthey could cook foronemeal. Itwasthebiggest
salmon ever killed. There aretwocreeks inthatregion, andtothis
dayayoung boycaneasily pullinalarge spring salmon there such

There isaholenearbycalled Hole-Raven-bored(Yel-djuwAtu lia),
because Raven made itlong ago. Inearly times, whenever there
was tobealarge runofeulachon orotherfish, quantities ofrocks
came outofthat hole. Sopeople used togothere tolook atit.
Inoneplace Alsek river runsunder aglacier. People canpass
beneath intheir canoes, but,ifanyone speaks, while they areunder
it,theglacier comes down onthem. They saythat inthose times
thisglacier was likeananimal, andcould hearwhatwassaid toit.
So,when theycamped justbelowit,people wouldsay,uGive ussome
food.Wehaveneed offood.&quot; Then theglacier always camedown
with arushandraised awavewhich threw numbers ofsalmon ashore.
Thepeoplewere alsointhehabit ofgoing upsome distance above

there inabundance. The firsttime theywentupthey discovered
people whowere allnaked except about theloins, andtherewasa
shaman among themwhowasreputedtohave agreatdealofstrength.
Forthatreason theytriedhim. They tookmussel shells, clamshells,
andsharpstones and tried tocuthishair,butasinglehaironhis
headwas 3inchesacross,soeverythingbroke. Thisshaman had
many spirits. Some wereglacier spirits,called Sit!tukohani,Fair-
girls-of-the-glacier ;others were oftheskytribe called Gus! tu
kohani,Fair-girls-of-the-sky.
Theshaman saidthat,ontheirwaydown, onecanoe load ofthe
down-riverpeople would bedrowned astheypassed under theglacier ;
butthespiritsoftheshaman below toldhimabout this,andhewent

theidea ofmaking thegatevery strong, and ofhavingitfastened

Then thesurvivors begged Lucwa ktoletthem have thebodies of

evening, however, hehad allofthebodies thrownoutside, and
climbed onthetopbeam ofthefortwhere hewalked aboutwhistling
with happiness. Meanwhile hisopponents loaded their canoes with
thedeadandtookthem home. When theyburned these, theytook
allthewomen theyhadenslaved inprevious expeditions andthrew
them also into theflames. Then alltheEagle people assembled,
returned toEagle fort,burnedit,anddestroyed nearly everybody

One oftheir victims wasamannamed Slta/n, related totheAtha

means that thiswoman wasvery sorry indeed forthedeadpeople

When theAlsek Riverpeople heard ofthisslaughter theywere
very sad,but firstthey started theirrespective shamansfighting.
Itwasreallytheshamansspirits thatfought. Theshaman would

however, could seeeach otherplainly. Theywould alsogivethe

When thevisitor came infront ofthehouses hedidnotspeakto

because others were somuch afraid ofthevisitor.
Therichman talked from thecanoe forsuch alongtime thatthey
made alongnoise instead ofspeakingtohim, tolethimknow thathe

While theyweremoving along slowly skinning it,theysawthecolor

After theyhadtested allofhisspirits they started south towar.
They were always warring with thesouthernpeople. They andthe
southern people hated each other. When theywentdown with this
shaman theyalways enslaved manywomen andsometimesdestroyed
awhole town,allonaccount ofhisstrength.
There wasabravemanamongthesouthernpeople, called Qloga ,
who liked tokillpeople fromupthisway. Onetime alittlefcoy

bowandarrows with him. Thebraveman discovered where he
was,went after him,andpulled himoutfrom under thelogwhere
hewashiding. Butmeanwhile thespiritsinthecanoes ofthenorthern

The littleboyhadkilled him. Then allrantothelittleboyandtook

andwondered atwhat hehaddone. Theynamed himever after
Little-head (Qaca/k!u

head-killed(Xuga wadjaget). Evennow theyrelate how Little-
head killed thebrave man. Then thenorthern people came around
thefortanddestroyed everybody there, some ofthose inthecanoes
beingalso killed.
After that thesouthern peoplestarted north towar. They had
ashaman among them. Onthewaytheycame toamannamed
Murrelet (Tclit). When thismanwasyoung, hehadbeen trained
torunupsteepcliffsbyhaving amountain-sheepshoof tied

surprised and said,&quot;Now givehimsomemorethingstoputonhis

thismanwas hisbrother. Itisrather hard tosay.Then hesaid,
&quot;Iamgoingtocuttheropes now. Cryharder.&quot; Sohecut allof

Afterward, however, thewarriors found where theyhad drifted to

Then they started fortheforttoward which theyhadoriginally

Onehigh-caste woman theysaved andcarried south. They took

what brought themup.During thatjourney theshaman never ate.When theycame tothebeach hisfriends didnotknow atfirst
whohewas,buthismother related allthathadhappened. Then
hisfriends came inandbegan tohelphimshow hisspirits. Hewas
getting otherspirits from thecountryofthepeople hewasgoing

black spotsasthere weretowns heintended toconquer, and,while
allwere helping himwith hisspirits, thespots one after another
begantosmoke. Hisfather toldhim toremember theplace where
hehadstayed andnotdestroyit.So,when thespots burned, the
burning stoppedattheoneathiselbow which hesimply cleaned
away with hishand. Thismeant thathewouldextinguish the fire
atthatpoint andnotfight there.
Then allofhisfriendsprepared themselves and setouttowar.
Theycamestraight uptoacertain fortwithoutattemptingtohide,
andthefortpeople shouted,&quot;Comeon,youChilkatpeople.&quot; They
hadnoiron inthosedays, butwerearmed with mussel-shell knives
andspears, andworeround woodenfightinghats. They destroyed
allthemen atthisfortandenslaved thewomen andchildren. After
ward theystoodoppositethefort,took offtheirwarhatsandbegan
toscalpalltheyhad killed. When theygotofftheyputthescalps
onsticks andtiedthem allaround thecanoe. Theycalledthis,&quot;Shout

then, noteven Russians. Itwasveryclose tothetimewhenRaven
made us.Thepeople whoweredoing thesethings wereKagwAntan.
Theyhadstarted towarfromLucacak!i-anandKAqlAnuwu.
After that allthesouthern peoplestarted north tomake war,
coming bytheoutsidepassage. The firstplace theyreached while
roundingthisisland wasMurrelet-pointfort(Aoli-tcIltinu).Onecanoe
started offtospyuponthem andwaschased ashore butwascarried
across anarrowstripoflandandsogotback. Therefore thisplace
iscalledThings-taken-over (AnAxgAiiia )-Then theycame right
uptothefort,destroyed it,andcapturedthewomen. There must
have been ahundred canoes comingtowar. Inthose days they
always usedbowsandarrows.
Acertain woman captured here said,&quot;There isanother townup

thetidewasprettywellup,passed throughaplace where there is

woods. Inthemorning they descended tofight, andthewomen
andchildren began crying. They capturedall.Meanwhile thetidal
rapids began,toroar asthetide fell.
Onewoman amongthecaptives wasveryold.They asked her
what time oftide toruntherapids, andshesaid toherself,&quot;It is

Itisjustaswell todieastobeenslaved.&quot; Soshesaid tothem,

andwere seennomore. The oldwoman wasdrowned with then*.
Sotheymade amark with their blood attheplace where these two

Nextdaytheremaining canoes started outwhen thetidewashigh
andcame toanother fortnext morning. While theywerearound
behind thisawoman came out.Then theyseized herandrana
spearupintoherbody frombeneath manytimes until shedropped
dead without speaking. Sothisfortcame tobecalled, Fort-where-
they-stabbed-up-into-a- woman s-privates (KAk !-kagus-wudu watAqi-

allinthefortweredestroyed, andstarted ontoanother. When they
made anattack inthosedays, theynever approachedintheday
time buttoward morning when everybody was sleeping soundly.
Both sidesusedwooden helmets andspears.
Atthis fortthewomen werealways diggingabigvarietyofclam
(called gaLl), storingthese clams inthefortforfood. The fortwas
filled with them. So,when theassailants started upthecliff,one
ofthemen inside struck himwith aclam shelljustunder thewar
hatsothathebledprofusely. Hecould notseeonaccount ofthe
blood. Then theman intheforttookanIndian axandbeat out
hisbrains. Afterward allinthefortseized clam shells andstruck
their foes inthefacewiththem sothatthey could notcome up.
They threw sofastthat thecanoes were allkeptaway ;sothat
placeisnow called Where-clams-kept-out-the-foes (Xacsixani-gaiJ).
Forthesame reason thiswastheonlyfortwhere anypeople were
saved, andontheotherhandmanyoftheenemy were destroyed by
thefortpeople.
Now theyleftthis fortandcame toanother, landing onabeach
nearby,andbetween them andthefortwaswhat theysupposedto

poise-belly (Tcitciu k!).
Thewarriors thought theyweregetting much thebest ofthepeople
upthisway,butreally onlyafewwere lefttolook after theforts,
most beingcollected elsewhere.
After theyhaddestroyedallthepeopleinfour fortstheylanded
onalongsandy beach tocut offthescalps. When there wasno
time toscalp,theheads were carried awayuntil there should bemore
leisure. Scalps andslaves werewhatpeople fought for,andthey
dried thescalps byrubbing themonhotstones orholding them near
the fire.Then they again started north. This raidconsumed the
whole summer.
Southward ofHuna wasafortonahigh cliff, called Jealous-man
fort(Caositl yiqa-mrwu ).Itwasnamed fromthemanwhoencamped

Thenext fortthey attacked iscalled Huna-peoplesfort(Huna-

people andstarted south. Atthistimetheywereoverloaded with the
slaves theyhadtaken, buttheywent intoeveryforttheypassed near

called Fort- that-rapids-run-around (Datx-xatkAnAda -nu).When

Most ofthenorthern people, however, wereencamped alongthe

came fromYakutat, Alsek river, andother placestoLuca/cak!i-an.
They talked togetherforalongtimeandfinally decided uponaplan.

theycutthetreeintwoandtook asection offalong thewhole length

Inolden times only high-caste people knew thestoryofRaven

these twooldmen,andyethehadadaughter, athing noone isable
toexplain. Nordopeople know what thisdaughter was. Thetwo
oldpersons took care ofherlikeservants, andespecially theyalways
looked into thewater before shedrank toseethat itwasperfectly
clean.
First ofallbeings Nas-cAki-yel created theHeron (LAq!)asavery

verygoodandvery wiseman atthat time.
Raven came intobeinginthiswise. His firstmother hadmany
children, buttheyalldiedyoung, andshecried overthemcontinually.
Accordingtosome, thiswoman wasNas-cA ki-yeTssister and itwas
Nas-cAki-yeJwhowasdoingthisbecause hedidnotwishhertohave
anymale children. ByandbyHeron came toherandsaid,&quot;What

Heron andRaven bothbecame servants toNas-cAki-yel, buthe

Some timeafterward aman died,andRaven, comingintothehouse,
sawhimthere with hiswifeandchildren weeping around him. Sohe
raised thedeadman sblanket withbothhands, held itoverthebody,
andbrought himback tolife.
&amp;gt;
After thatbothRaven andherhusband told thiswoman thatthere
wasnodeath, butshedisbelieved them. ThenRaven said toher,
&quot;Liedown andgotosleep.&quot; And, assheslept, shethought shesaw
awide trailwithmany people uponitand allkinds offierce animals
around. Good people had topass alongthis trail inorder tolive
again. When shecame totheendofthetrail therewasagreat river
there, andacanoe came across toherfrom theother sideofit.She
entered thisandcrossed. There some people came toherandsaid,
&quot;You better goback.Wearenotinagood place. There isstarva
tionhere,wearecold,andwegetnowater todrink.&quot;
This iswhypeople burn thebodies ofthedeadandputfood intothe
fireforthem toeat.Burningtheirbodies makes thedeadcomfortable.
Iftheywerenotburned theirspirits would becold. This iswhythey
invite allthose oftheoppositeclan aswell asthenearest rela
tions ofthedeadman swife, seating them togetherinoneplace, and
burn food infront ofthem. Itisbecause they think thatthedead
person getsalloftheproperty destroyed atthefeastand allofthe
foodthenburned up.Itisonaccount ofwhatRaven showed them
thattheydoso.
Because Nas-cAki-yel gotitintohismind towish fordaylight inthe
world, hehadwished foragrandchild through whom itmight come.
Now, therefore, although heknew what answer hewouldreceive, he
sent forLiuwAt-uwadji gi-can andquestioned himtoseewhether he
would answer right:&quot;Where didthischildcomefrom ?Whose isit?
Canyoutell?&quot; And theother said,&quot;His eyeslook liketheeyesof
Raven.&quot; That ishowhecame togetthename Raven.
After awhile thebaby began tocrawl about. Hisgrandfather
thought agreat deal ofhimand lethimplaywitheverythinginthe
house. Everythinginthehouse was his.TheRaven began crying
forthemoon, untilfinally theyhanded ittohimandquickasawink
heletitgoupintothesky. After hehadobtained everything else,
hebegantocryfortheboxinwhich daylight wasstored. Hecried,
cried, cried foravery long time, until helooked asthough hewere
getting very sick,andfinallyhisgrandfather said, &quot;Bring mychild
here.&quot; Sotheyhanded Raven tohisgrandfather. Then hisgrand
father said tohim, &quot;My grandchild, Iamgiving youthelastthingI
have inthe world.&quot; Sohegaveittohim.
Then Raven, whowasalready quite large, walked down along the
bank ofNass river until heheard thenoise people weremaking as
they fished along theshore foreulachon inthedarkness. Allthepeo
pleintheworld then lived atoneplaceatthemouth oftheNass.

Theyhadalready heard thatNas-cAki-yel hadsomething called&quot;day
light/ which would somedaycome intotheworld, andtheyused to
talkabout itagreat deal. They were afraid ofit.
ThenRaven shouted tothefishermen,&quot;Why doyoumake somuch
noise? Ifyoumake somuch noise Iwillbreakdaylight onyou.&quot;
Eight canoe loads ofpeople werefishing there. Buttheyanswered,
&quot;You arenotNas-cAki-yel. Howcanyouhave thedaylight?&quot;, and
thenoise continued. ThenRaven opened theboxalittleandlight
shotovertheworld likelightning. Atthattheymade stillmore noise.
Soheopened theboxcompletely andtherewasdaylight everywhere.
When thisdaylight burst upon thepeople theywere verymuch
frightened, andsome ranintothewater, some intothewoods. Those
thathadhair-seal orfur-seal skins forclothing ranintothewater and
became hair sealsandfurseals. Hair sealandfursealwereformerly
onlythenames oftheclothing they had.&quot;Those whohad skins
called marten skins, black-bear skins, grizzly-bear skins, etc.,ran
^intothewoods andturned intosuch animals.
Petrel (GAnu k)wasoneofthefirstpersons created byNas-cAki-yel.
Hewaskeeperofthefresh water, andwould letnone elsetouch it.
Thespring heowned wasonarocky island outside ofKuiu, called
Deki-nu (Fort-far-out), where thewellmaystillbeseen. Raven
stole agreat mouthful ofthiswater anddroppedithereandthere
ashewentalong. This istheoriginofthegreatrivers oftheworld,
theNass, Skeena, Stikine, Chilkat, andothers. Hesaid, Thisthing
that Idrophereandthere willwhirl allthetime. Itwillnotoverflow
theworld, yetthere willbeplentyof water.&quot; Before thistime
Raven issaidtohavebeenpure white, but,ashewasflying upthrough
thesmoke holewith Petrel swater, thelatter said, &quot;Spirits, hold
downmysmoke hole.&quot; Sothey heldhim until hewasturned black
bythesmoke.
After thisRaven sawafirefaroutatsea. Tyingapieceofpitch-
wood toachicken hawk sbill,hetoldhimtogoouttothisfire,touch
itwith thepitchwood, andbringitback. When hehadbroughtitto
himRaven putitintotherockandtheredcedar saying,&quot;This is
howyou aretogetyour fire,from thisrockand thisredcedar,&quot;
andthat isthewaytheyformerlydid.
ThusRaven (Yel)went aboutamongthenatives ofAlaskatelling
themwhat todo,but*Nas-cAki-yeJ theynever saw. Raven showed
alltheTlingit what todoforaliving, buthedidnotgettobesuch
ahighpersonasNas-cAki-yel, andhetaughtthepeople much fool
ishness. Atthattime theworld was fullofdangerousanimals and
fish. Raven also tiedupsome witches, andsoitwasthrough him
that thepeoplebelieved inwitchcraft. Then hetold thepeople
thatsome wild animals were tobetheir friends (i.e.,their crest
animals) towhich theywere totalk.

Once hegave afeast andinvited personstoitfrom (ttherplaces.
Hehadtwo slaves after that,named GidzagetandGidzanuqlu.
This iswhy thenatives herehad slaves. Itwasonaccount ofhis
example. There wasamanwhohadnoarm, soRaven thought he
would beashaman andcurehim. This ishowtheTlingit came to
haveshamans. After therewasdeath heshowed themhow todance
over thebody placedinthemiddle ofthefloor.
Raven alsotaughtthepeople how tomake halibut hooks, and
went out fishing: with them. Hehadnames forthehalibut hookso
andtalked tothem before heletthemdown intothesea. That is
why thenatives dosonow. Healsotaught them tobeveryquick
when theywent outhalibutfishingortheywould catchnothing.
Healsomade different kinds offishtraps andtaughtthepeople
how tousethem. Hemade thesmall variety andabigtrap,shaped
likeabarrel, foruseintheStikine.
Hetaught themhow tomake thesealspear (kAt). Ithasmany
barbs, andthere aredifferent kinds. One iscalled tsa-cAxlctdza s.
Itisprovided withsome attachment that hitstheseal.(tsa)upon
theheadwhenever itcomes tothesurface, drivingitshead under
water until itdies,andthat iswhat thenamesignifies.
Then heshowed themhow tomake acanoe. Thishedidonthe
Queen Charlotte islands. At first thepeople were afraid toget
intoit,buthesaid,&quot;The canoe isnotdangerous. Peoplewillseldom
getdrowned.&quot;
Hetaught themhow tocatch asalmon calledIcqe n,which requires
adifferent kind ofhookfrom thatused forhalibut. Theplacewhere
hetaught people how togetdifferent kinds ofshellfish isabeach
ontheQueen Charlotte islands called Raven sbeach tothisday.
After hewasthrough teachingthepeoplethesethings, hewent
under theocean, andwhen hecame back, taught them that thesea
animals arenotwhatwethink they are,butarelikehumanbeings.
First hewent tothehalibutpeople. They have achiefwhoinvited
him toeat,andhaddried devilfish andother kinds ofdried fish
broughtout.Hewaswell liked everywhere hewent under thesea
because hewasaverysmart man. After thathewent toseethe
sculpin people, whowereveryindustrious andhad allkinds ofthings
intheir houses. Thekiller-whale people seemed toliveonhair-seal
meat, fat,and oil. Their head chiefwasnamed GonaqAde t,and
even tothisdaythenatives saythat thesightofhimbrings good
fortune.
While hewasunder theocean hesaw,some people fishingforhali
but,andhetried toteasethembytaking hold oftheir bait. They,
however, caught himbythe billandpulled himupasfarasthe
bottom oftheir canoe, where hebraced himself sothatthey pulled
his billout.They didnotknow what this billwasand called it

gonet-luwu (bill-of-something-unknown). Then Raven went
fromhouse tohouseinquiringforhisbilluntil hecame tothehouse
ofthechief. Upon askingforitthere, theyhanded ittohimwrapped
ineagledown. Then heputitback into itsplaceandflew offthrough
thesmoke hole.
Raven leftthattownandcame toanother. There hesawaking
salmon jumping about faroutatsea.Hegotitashore and killed
it.Because hewasable todoeverything, thenatives did allthat
hetoldthem. Hewastheonewhotaughtallthingstothenatives,
andsome ofthem stillfollow histeachings. After thathegotall
kinds ofbirds forhisservants. Itwasthrough these thatpeople
found outhewastheRaven.
\Oncehewent toacertainplaceandtoldthepeopletogoandfight
others. Hesaid,&quot;You gothereand killthemall,andyouwillhave
allthethingsinthat town.&quot; Thiswasthebeginningofwar.
After having beendown among the fishteaching them, Raven
wentamongthebirds andland animals. Hesaid tothegrouse
(nukt),&quot;You aretoliveinaplace where itiswintry, andyouwill
always lookoutforaplace highupsothatyoucangetplentyof
breeze.&quot; Then hehanded thegrouse fourwhitepebbles, telling him
toswallow them sothattheymight become hisstrength.&quot;You
willneverstarve,&quot; hesaid,&quot;solongasyouhave these fourpebbles.&quot;
Healsosaid,&quot;You know that Sealion isyour grandchild. You
must begenerous, getfourmore pebbles andgivethem to him.&quot;
That ishowthesealion came tohave fourlarge pebbles.Itthrows
these athunters, and,ifonestrikes aperson,itkillshim. From
thisstoryitisknown thatthegrouse andthesealion canunderstand
each other.
Raven said totheptarmigan:&quot;You willbethemaker ofsnow-
shoes. You willknowhow totravel insnow.&quot; Itwasfrom these
birds that theAthapascans learned how tomake snowshoes, and it
wasfromthem thatthey learned how toputtheirlacingson.
NextRaven came tothe &quot;wildcanary&quot; (s!as!), which isfound in
theTlingit countryalltheyearround, and said: &quot;You willbehead
among thevery small birds. You arenottoliveonwhathuman
beingseat.Keepaway from them.&quot;
Then hewent totherobin andsaid: &quot;You willmake thepeople
happy byletting them hear yourwhistle. You willbeagood
whistler.&quot;
Then hesaid totheflicker (kun):&quot;You willbetheheadoneamong

Hesaid tothelugA n,abirdthat lives faroutontheocean:&quot;You

Then hecame tothesnipes andsaid tothem:&quot;You willalways go

Hesaid totheasojaca/tci,asmall bird with greenish-yellow

Toavery small bird called kot!ai,about thesizeofabutterfly,

ThenRaven came tothebluejayandsaid: &quot;You willhave very

Then hewent toabird called xunkAha andsaid: &quot;You willnever

And sohewentonspeakingtoallthebirds. !
Then hesaid totheland otter: &quot;You willliveinthewaterjustas
well ason land.&quot; Heandtheland otter weregood friends,sothey
went halibutfishing together. Theland otterwasafinefisherman.
Finally hesaid totheland otter: &quot;You willalways haveyourhouse

acanoecapsizes withpeopleinityouwillsavethemandmakethem
yourfriends.&quot; The land-otter-man (kucta-qa) originated from
Raventellingthis totheland otter. AllAlaskans know about the
land-otter-man butveryfew tellthestoryofRavencorrectly.
Ifthefriends ofthosewhohavebeentakenawaybytheland otters
getthem back, theybecome shamans, therefore itwasthrough the
land otters thatshamans were firstknown. Shamans canseeone

The firstman captured (or&quot;
saved&quot;) bytheland otters wasa
KiksA dinamed KAka .Theland otters keptcoming tohiminlarge
canoes lookinglikehismother orhissister orother dearrelation, and
pretendingthattfieyhadbeen lookingforhim foralong time. But
theycould notcontrol themselves aswell ashe,andatsuch times he
would discover whotheywereandthat theircanoe wasnothing but
askate. Finally, whenKAka found thathecould notseehisfriends,
hethought thathemightaswellgivehimself uptotheland otters.
Then theynamed himQowulka ,aword intheland-otter language
nowappliedtoakind offishhook which thehalibut arethoughtto
likebetter than allothers. Nowadays, when afigureofQowulka
ismade,itiscovered with adogskin, because itwasbymeans ofa
dogskinthathefrightened thelandotters, andtheyalsohanghis
apron about withdogbones. Theshaman who ispossessed byhim
dresses inthesame manner. FromKAka thepeoplelearned that
theland otters affect theminds ofthosewhohave been withthem
foralongtime soastoturnthem againsttheirown friends. They
alsolearned fromhimthat there areshamans among theland otters,
andthattheland otters have alanguageoftheirown.
FortwoyearsKAka/;sfriends hunted forhim, fastingatthesame
timeandremaining awayfrom their wives. Attheendofthisperiod
theland otters went toanisland about 50miles from Sitka andtook
KAka withthem. Theland-otter tribe goestothisplace every year.
Then anoldland-otter-woman called *toKAka :&quot;Mynephew,Isee
thatyouareworrying about thepeopleatyourhome. When you
gettotheplace whither wearegoing place yourselfastride ofthefirst
logyouseelying onthebeach and sitthere aslong asyoucan.&quot;
Andherhusband said tohim:&quot;Keep yourhead covered over. Do
notlook around.&quot; They gavehim this direction because they
thought,&quot;Ifthishuman beingsees allofourways andlearns allof
ourhabits, weshall die.&quot; Onthewayacross theland-otter-people
sangasong, reallyakind ofprayer,ofwhich thewords are, &quot;May

Themoment theycame toland theland-otter-people disappeared
andhedidnotknow what hadbecome ofthem. Theymayhave

madehim so.
ByandbyKAka&quot;s friends, whowere atthattimehuntingforfur

They followed thesound seaward until theysawthousands and

Thepeoplewere delightedtofindeven hisbody, andtook itinto

land otters long before, butKAka7was sostrong-minded afellow
thattheyfeltthey could donothing with him, sotheylethimgo

because hedidnotbelieve thatland otters arestronger thanhuman
beings.
After thepeople hadbrought KAka7toaplace justaround thepoint
from theirvillage, hesaid,&quot;Leave mehere foralittle while.&quot; So
most ofhisrelations remained with him, while twowenthome to

After leavingtheland otters Raven appearedatTaku. There is
acliffatthemouth ofthat inlet called WAs!As!e where theNorth
Wind used tolive,andRaven stayedthere with him. TheNorth
Wind wasveryproud andshone allover withwhat theIndians
thought were icicles. SotheIndians never sayanything against the
North Wind, however longitblows, because ithasspirits (i.e.,power).
Years agopeople thought thatthere werespiritsinallthelargecliffs
upontheislands, andtheywould praytothose cliffs.- They had
thisfeeling toward them because Raven once lived inthis cliffwith
theNorth Wind.
Raven observed certainregulations very strictly when hewas
amongtherivers hehadcreated. Hetoldpeople never tomention
anythingthat lives intheseabyitsrightname while theywere there,
buttocallasealarabbit, forinstance, andsowith theother animals.
Thiswas tokeepthem from meeting with misfortune amongthe
rapids. FormerlytheIndians were verystrict with their children
when theywentuptherivers, butnowadaysallthathasbeen for
gotten.
~Sfter thisRaven wrenttoChilkat andentered asweat house along
withthechief ofthekiller whales who tried toroast him. Raven, how
ever,hadapieceoficenearhimandeverynowandthenputpartof
itinto hismouth. Then hewould tellthekiller whale thathefelt
chilly andmake him feelashamed. &quot;IfIdidnotbelongtothe
GanAxte difamily,&quot;saidRaven,&quot;Icould nothave stood thatsweat
house.&quot; Forthisreason theGanAxte dinowclaim theraven asan
emblem andthink theyhavemore righttoitthananybodyelse.
ItwasfromRaven thatpeople found outthere areAthapascan
Indians. Hewentback into their country. SotheChilkat people
tothisdaymake theirmoney bygoingthither. Healsoshowed the
Chilkat people how tomaketcil,secret storehouses maintained some
distance outoftown, andhetaught themhow toputsalmon into
these andkeepthem frozen there over winter. SotheChilkat peo
plegottheirname fromtcil, &quot;storehouse,&quot; andxat,&quot;salmon.&quot;
Raven alsoshowed theChilkat peoplethefirstseeds oftheIndian
tobacco andtaught themhow toplantit.After itwasgrown up,
hedriedit,gathered clam shells, roasted them until theywerevery
soft,andpounded them upwith thetobacco. They used tochew
this,and itwassogoodthat itissurprising theygaveitup.They
