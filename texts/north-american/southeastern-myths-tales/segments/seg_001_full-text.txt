Myths and Tales of the Southeastern Indians

[1929]
Start Reading
This collection of stories from the Southeastern Native American region
 covers mythology and folklore from the Creek,
 Hitchiti, Alabama, Kosati, and Natchez.
 The Creek (including the Alabama, Hitichi and Kosati) originally
 lived in northern Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
 The Natchez resided in Louisiana.
The Southeast tribes once had a sophisticated culture, including
 a stable federal form of government.
 They built huge earthworks, the largest indigenous buildings north of Mexico.
 Decimated by smallpox and contact with the Europeans, the inhabitants
 of this region were forcibly relocated to the Oklahoma area in the
 19th century, alongside the better-known Cherokee.
These stories were collected from survivors
 in the early twentieth century.
 At this time, their folklore had been influenced for centuries by
 both European and (particularly) African sources.
 The tales included here include such 'modern' elements as guns and
 dry-goods stores, and obvious post-relocation wildlife such as Buffalo.
 However, the original stories are visible in strong relief,
 including the trickster (in this area, a very rascally Rabbit),
 the Corn-mother, and many tales that are similar to the Cherokee and other
 tribes farther afield.
This collection has numerous duplicates and variations, so reading
 it in a linear fashion may prove repetitious.
 However, this is invaluable data for the study of comparative folklore.
 The chapter on
Comparison of Myths
will be of particular interest in this regard.
