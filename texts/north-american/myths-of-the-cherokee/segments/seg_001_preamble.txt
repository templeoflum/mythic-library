MYTHS  OF  THE  CHEROKEE
By  James  Mooney
I— INTRODUCTION
The  myths  given  in  this  paper  are  part  of  a  large  body  of  material
collected  among  the  Cherokee,  chiefly  in  successive  field  seasons  from
1887  to  L890,  inclusive,  and  comprising  more  or  less  extensive  notes,
together  with  original  Cherokee  manuscripts,  relating  to  the  history,
archeology,  geographic  nomenclature,  personal  names,  botany,  medi-
cine, arts,  home  life,  religion,  songs,  ceremonies,  and  language  of  the
tribe.  It  is  intended  that  this  material  shall  appear  from  time  to
time  in  a  series  of  papers  which,  when  finally  brought  together,  shall
constitute  a  monograph  upon  the  Cherokee  Indians.  This  paper  may
be  considered  the  first  of  the  series,  all  that  has  hitherto  appeared
being  a  short  paper  upon  the  sacred  formulas  of  the  tribe,  published
in  the  Seventh  Annual  Report  of  the  Bureau  in  1891  and  containing  a
synopsis  of  the  Cherokee  medico-religious  theory,  with  twenty-eight
specimens  selected  from  a  body  of  about  six  hundred  ritual  formulas
written  down  in  the  Cherokee  language  and  alphabet  by  former
doctors  of  the  tribe  and  constituting  altogether  the  largest  body  of
aboriginal  American  literature  in  existence.
Although  the  Cherokee  arc  probably  the  largest  and  most  impor-
tant tribe  in  the  Tinted  States,  having  their  own  national  government
and  numbering  at  any  time  in  their  history  from  20,000  to  25,000  per-
sons, almost  nothing  has  yet  been  written  of  their  history  or  general
ethnology,  as  compared  with  the  literature  of  such  northern  tribes  as
the  Delawares,  the  Iroquois,  or  the  Ojibwa.  The  difference  is  due  to
historical  reasons  which  need  not  be  discussed  here.
It  might  seem  at  first  thought  that  the  Cherokee,  with  their  civi-
lized code  of  laws,  their  national  press,  their  schools  and  seminaries,
are  so  far  advanced  along  the  white  man's  road  as  to  offer  but  little
inducement  for  ethnologic  study.  This  is  largely  true  of  those  in  the
Indian  Territory,  with  whom  the  enforced  deportation,  two  generations
ago,  from  accustomed  scenes  and  surroundings  did  more  at  a  single
stroke  to  obliterate  Indian  ideas  than  could  have  been  accomplished 11


12  MYTHS    OF    THE    OHEBOKEE  [bth.aiw.19
by  fifty  years  of  slow  development.  There  remained  behind,  however,
in  the  bearl  of  the  Carolina  mountains,  :i  considerable  body,  outnum-
bering todaj  such  well-known  western  tribes  as  the  Omaha,  Pawnee,
Comanche,  and   Kiowa,  and  it  is  among  these,  the  old  conservative
Kitn'hwa  < 'lenient,  that  t lie  ancient  things  have  been  preserved.  Moun- taineers guard  well  the  past,  and  in  the  secluded  forests  of  Xantahala  and
Oconaluftee,  faraway  from  the  main-traveled  road  of  modern  progress,
the  Cherokee  priest  still  treasures  the  Legends  and  repeats  the  mystic
rituals  handed  down  from  his  ancestors.  There  is  change  indeed  in
dress  and  outward  seeming,  but  the  heart  of  the  Indian  is  still  his  own.
For  this  and  other  reasons  much  the  greater  portion  of  the  material
herein  contained  has  been  procured  among  the  East  Cherokee  living
upon  the  Qualla  reservation  in  western  North  Carolina  and  in  various
detached  settlements  between  the  reservation  and  the  Tennessee  line.
This  has  been  supplemented  with  information  obtained  in  the  Cherokee
Nation  in  Indian  Territory,  chiefly  from  old  men  and  women  who
had  emigrated  from  what  is  now  Tennessee  and  Georgia,  and  who
consequently  had  a  better  local  knowledge  of  these  sections,  as  well  as
of  the  history  of  the  western  Nation,  than  is  possessed  by  their  kindred
in  Carolina.  The  historical  matter  and  the  parallels  are,  of  course,
collated  chiefly  from  printed  sources,  but  the  myths  proper,  with  but
few  exceptions,  are  from  original  investigation.
The  historical  sketch  must  be  understood  as  distinctly  a  sketch,  not
a  detailed  narrative,  for  which  there  is  not  space  in  the  present  paper.
The  Cherokee  have  made  deep  impress  upon  the  history  of  the  southern
states,  and  no  more  has  been  attempted  here  than  to  give  the  leading-
facts  in  connected  sequence.  As  the  history  of  the  Nation  after  the
removal  to  the  West  and  the  reorganization  in  Indian  Territory  pre-
sents but  few  points  of  ethnologic  interest,  it  has  been  but  briefly
treated.  On  the  other  hand  the  affairs  of  the  eastern  band  have  been
discussed  at  some  length,  for  the  reason  that  so  little  concerning  this
remnant  is  to  be  found  in  print.
One  of  the  chief  purposes  of  ethnologic  study  is  to  trace  the
development  of  human  thought  under  varying  conditions  of  race  and
environment,  the  result  showing  always  that  primitive  man  is  essen-
tially the  same  in  every  part  of  the  world.  With  this  object  in  view
a  considerable  space  has  been  devoted  to  parallels  drawn  almost  entirely
from  Indian  tribes  of  the  United  States  and  British  America.  For
the  southern  countries  there  is  but.  little  trustworthy  material,  and  to
extend  the  inquiry  to  the  eastern  continent  and  the  islands  of  the  sea
would  be  to  invite  an  endless  task.
The  author  desires  to  return  thanks  for  many  favors  from  the
Library  of  Congress,  the  Geological  Survey,  and  the  Smithsonian
Institution,  and  for  much  courteous  assistance  and  friendly  suggestion

II     HISTORICAL  SKETCH  OF  THE  CHEROKEE
The  Traditionary  Period
The  Cherokee  were  the  mountaineers  of  the  South,  holding  the
entire  Allegheny  region  from  the  interlocking  bead-streams  of  the
Kanawha  and  the  Tennessee  southward  almost  to  the  site  of  Atlanta,
and  from  the  Blue  ridge  on  the  east  to  the  Cumberland  range  on  the
west,  a  territory  comprising  an  area  of  about  40,000  square  miles,
now  included  in  the  states  of  Virginia,  Tennessee,  North  Carolina,  South
Carolina,  Georgia,  and  Alabama.  Their  principal  towns  were  upon
the  headwaters  of  the  Savannah.  Hiwassee,  and  Tuckasegee,  and  along
the  whole  length  of  the  Little  Tennessee  to  its  junction  with  the  main
stream.  Itsati,  or  Echota,  on  the  south  hank  of  the  Little  Tennessee,  a
few  miles  above  the  mouth  of  Tellico  river,  in  Tennessee,  was  commonly
considered  the  capital  of  the  Nation.  As  the  advancing  whites  pressed
upon  them  from  the  east  and  northeast  the  more  exposed  towns  were
destroyed  or  abandoned  and  new  settlements  were  formed  lower  down
the  Tennessee  and  on  the  upper  branches  of  the  Chattahoochee  and
the  Coosa.
As  is  always  (he  ease  with  tribal  geography-,  there  were  no  fixed
boundaries,  and  on  every  side  the  Cherokee  frontiers  were  contested
by  rival  claimants.  In  Virginia,  there  is  reason  to  believe,  the  tribe
was  held  in  check  in  early  days  by  the  Powhatan  and  the  Monacan.
On  the  east  and  southeast  the  Tuscarora  and  Catawba  were  their  invet-
erate enemies,  with  hardly  even  a  momentary  truce  within  the  historic
period;  and  evidence  goes  to  show  that  the  Sara  or  Cheraw  were  fully
as  hostile.  On  the  south  there  was  hereditary  war  with  the  Creeks,
who  claimed  nearly  the  whole,  of  upper  Georgia  as  theirs  by  original
possession,  but  who  were  being  gradually  pressed  down  toward  the
Gulf  until,  through  the  mediation  of  the  United  States,  a  treaty  was
finally  made  fixing  the  boundary  between  the  two  tribes  along  a  line
running  about  due  west  from  the  mouth  of  Broad  river  on  the  Savan-
nah. Toward  the  west,  the  Chickasaw  on  the  lower  Tennessee  and  the
Shawano  on  the  Cumberland  repeatedly  turned  back  the  tide  of  Chero-
kee invasion  from  the  rich  central  valleys,  while  the  powerful  Iroquois
in  the  far  north  set  up  an  almost  unchallenged  claim  of  paramount
lordship  from  the  Ottawa  river  of  Canada  southward  at  Least  to  the
Kentucky  river. 14

On  the  other  hand,  by  their  defeat  of  the  ("reeks  and  expulsion  <>f the  Shawano,  the  Cherokee  made  good  the  claim  which  they  asserted
to  all  the  lands  from  upper  Georgia  to  the  Ohio  river,  including  the
rich  hunting  grounds  of  Kentucky.  Holding  as  they  did  the  great
mountain  harrier  between  the  English  settlements  on  the  coast  and  the
French  or  Spanish  garrisons  along  the  Mississippi  and  the  Ohio,  their
geographic  position,  no  less  than  their  superior  number,  would  have
given  them  the  balance  of  power  in  the  South  but  for  a  looseness  of
tribal  organization  in  striking  contrast  to  the  compactness  of  the  Iro-
quois league,  by  which  for  more  than  a  century  the  French  power
was  held  in  check  in  the  north.  The  English,  indeed,  found  it  con-
venient to  recognize  certain  chiefs  as  supreme  in  the  tribe,  but  the  only
real  attempt  to  weld  the  whole  Cherokee  Nation  into  a  political  unit
was  that  made  by  the  French  agent,  Priber,  about  1  TMtJ.  which  failed
from  its  premature  discovery  by  the  English.  We  frequently  find
their  kingdom  divided  against  itself,  their  very  number  preventing
unity  of  action,  while  still  giving  them  an  importance  above  that
of  neighboring  tribes.
The  proper  name  by  which  the  Cherokee  call  themselves  (l)1  is
Yuii'wiya'.  or  Ani'-Yun'wiya'  in  the  third  person,  signifying  •"real
people,"  or  "  principal  people."  a  word  closely  related  toOnwe-hofiwe, the  name  by  which  the  cognate  Iroquois  know  themselves.  The  word
properly  denotes  "Indians,"  as  distinguished  from  people  of  other
races,  but  in  usage  it  is  restricted  to  mean  members  of  the  Cherokee
tribe,  those  of  other  tribes  being  designated  as  Creek,  Catawba,  etc.,
as  the  case  may  be.  On  ceremonial  occasions  they  frequently  speak  of
themselves  as  Ani'-Kitu'hwagi,  or  "people  of  Kitu'hwa,"  an  ancient
settlement  on  Tuckasegee  river  and  apparently  the  original  nucleus  of
the  tribe.  Among  the  western  Cherokee  this  name  has  been  adopted
by  a  secret  society  recruited  from  the  full-blood  element  and  pledged
to  resist  the  advances  of  the  white  man's  civilization.  Under  the
various  forms  of  Cuttawa,  Gattochwa,  Kittuwa.  etc..  as  spelled  by  dif-
ferent authors,  it  was  also  used  by  several  northern  Algonquian tribes
as  a  synonym  for  Cherokee.
Cherokee,  the  name  by  which  they  are  commonly  known,  has  no
meaning  in  their  own  language,  and  seems  to  be  of  foreign  origin.
As  used  among  themselves  the  form  is  Tsa'lagi'  or  Tsa'ragi'.  It  first
appears  as  Chalaque  in  the  Portuguese  narrative  of  De  Soto's  expedi- tion, published  originally  in  L557,  while  we  rind  Cheraqui  in  a  French
document  of  1699,  and  Cherokee  as  an  English  form  as  early,  at  'east,  as
1708.  The  name  has  thus  an  authentic  history  of  360  years.  There
is  evidence  that  it  is  derived  from  the  Choctaw  word  choluk  or  chiluk,
signifying  a  pit  or  cave,  and  comes  to  us  through  the  so-called  Mobilian
trade   language,   a  corrupted  Choctaw  jargon   formerly   used   as  the

medium  of  coi   unication  among  all  the  tribes  of  the  <  rulf  states,  as
fax  north  as  the  mouth  of  the  <  >hio  (2).  Within  iliis  area  many  of  the
tribes  were  commonly  known  under  Choctaw  names,  even  though  <>t' widerj  differing  Linguistic  stocks,  ami  if  such  a  name  existed  for  the
Cherokee  it  must  undoubtedly  have  been  communicated  to  the  first
Spanish  explorers  by  I  >e  Soto's  interpreters.  This  theory  is  borne
out  by  their  Iroquois  (Mohawk)  name,  Oyata'geronon',  as  given  by
Hewitt,  signifying  "inhabitants  of  the  cave  country,"  the  Allegheny
region  being  peculiarly  a  cave  country,  in  which  "rock  shelters,"  con-
taining numerous  traces  of  Indian  occupancy,  are  of  frequent  occur-
rence. Their  Catawba  name  also.  Manteran,  as  given  by  Gatschet,
signifying  "coming  out  of  the  ground,"  seems  to  contain  the  same
reference.  Adair's  attempt  to  connect  the  name  Cherokee  with  their
word  for  &re,atsila,  is  an  error  founded  upon  imperfect  knowledge  of
the  Language.
Among  other  synonyms  for  the  tribe  are  Rickahockan,  or  Recna-
hecrian,  the  ancient  Powhatan  name,  and  Tallige',  or  Tallige'wi,  the
ancient  name  used  in  the  Walam  Olum  chronicle  of  the' Lenape'.  Con-
cerning  both  the  application  and  the  etymology  of  this  last  name  there
has  been  much  dispute,  but  there  seems  no  reasonable  doubt  as  to  the
identity  of  the  people.
Linguistically  the  Cherokee  belong  to  the  Iroquoian  stock,  the
relationship  having  been  suspected  by  Barton  over  a  century  ago,  and
by  Gallatin  and  Hale  at  a  later  period,  and  definitely  established  by
Hewitt  in  1887. ]  While  there  can  now  be  no  question  of  the  connec-
tion, the  marked  lexical  and  grammatical  differences  indicate  that  the
separation  must  have  occurred  at  a  very  early  period.  As  is  usually
the  case  with  a  large  tribe  occupying  an  extensive  territory,  the  lan-
guage is  spoken  in  several  dialects,  the  principal  of  which  may.  for
want  of  other  names,  be  conveniently  designated  as  the  Eastern.  Middle,
and  Western.  Adair's  classification  into  "Aviate"  (.'///<//),  or  low,  and
"Ottare"  (d'taM),  or  mountainous,  must  be  rejected  as  imperfect.
The  Eastern  dialect,  formerly  often  called  the  Lower  Cherokee
dialect,  was  originally  spoken  in  all  the  towns  upon  the  waters  of  the
Keowee  and  Tugaloo,  head-streams  of  Savannah  river,  in  South  Caro-
lina ami  the  adjacent  portion  of  Georgia.  Its  chief  peculiarity  is  a
rolling  /'.  which  takes  the  place  of  the  /  of  the  other  dialects.  In
this  dialect  the  tribal  name  is  Tsa'ragi',  which  the  English  settlers  of
Carolina  corrupted  to  Cherokee,  while  the  Spaniards,  advancing  from
the  south,  became  better  familial'  with  the  other  form,  which  they
wrote  as  Chalaque.  Owing  to  their  exposed  frontier  position,  adjoin-
ing the  white  settlements  of  Carolina,  the  Cherokee  of  this  division

were  the  first  to  feel  the  shock  of  war  in  the  campaigns  of  L760  and
1776.  with  the  result  that  before  the  close  of  the  Revolution  they  had
been  completely  extirpated  from  their  original  territory  and  scattered
as  refugees  among  the  more  western  towns  of  the  tribe.  The  con-
sequence was  that  they  lost  their  distinctive  dialect,  which  is  now
practically  extinct.  In  1888  it  was  spoken  by  but  one  man  on  the
reservation  in  North  Carolina.
The  Middle  dialect,  which  might  properly  be  designated  the  Kituhwa
dialect,  was  originally  spoken  in  the  towns  on  the  Tuckasegee  and  the
headwaters  of  the  Little  Tennessee,  in  the  very  heart  of  the  Cherokee
country,  and  is  still  spoken  by  the  great  majority  of  those  now  living  on
the  Qualla  reservation.  In  some  of  its  phonetic  forms  it  agrees  with
the  Eastern  dialect,  but  resembles  the  Western  in  having  the  /  sound.
The  Western  dialect  was  spoken  in  most  of  the  towns  of  east  Ten-
nessee and  upper  Georgia  and  upon  Hiwassee  and  Cheowa  rivers  in
North  Carolina.  It  is  the  softest  and  most  musical  of  all  the  dialects
of  this  musical  language,  having  a  frequent  liquid  /  and  eliding  many
of  the  harsher  consonants  found  in  the  other  forms.  It  is  also  the
literary  dialect,  and  is  spoken  by  most  of  those  now  constituting  the
Cherokee  Nation  in  the  West.
Scattered  among  the  other  Cherokee  are  individuals  whose  pronun-
ciation and  occasional  peculiar  terms  for  familiar  objects  give  indica-
tion of  a  fourth  and  perhaps  a  fifth  dialect,  which  can  not  now  be
localized.  It  is  possible  that  these  differences  may  come  from  for-
eign  admixture,  as  of  Natchez.  Taskigi,  or  Shawano  blood.  There  is
some  reason  for  believing  that  the  people  living  on  Nantahala  river
differed  dialectically  from  their  neighbors  on  either  side  (;:).
The  Iroquoian  stock,  to  which  the  Cherokee  belong,  had  its  chief
home  in  the  north,  its  tribes  occupying  a  compact  territory  winch
comprised  portions  of  Ontario,  New  York,  Ohio,  and  Pennsylvania,
and  extended  down  the  Susquehanna  and  ( Jhesapeake  bay  almost  to  the
latitude  of  Washington.  Another  body,  including  the  Tuscarora,
Nottoway,  and  perhaps  also  the  Meherrin.  occupied  territory  in  north-
eastern North  Carolina  and  the  adjacent  portion  of  Virginia.  The
( 'herokee  themselves  constituted  the  third  and  southernmost  bodj  .  It
is  evident  that  tribes  of  common  stock  must  atone  time  have  occupied
contiguous  territories,  and  such  we  find  to  be  the  case  in  this  instance.
The  Tuscarora  and  Meherrin.  and  presumably  also  the  Nottoway,  are
known  to  have  come  from  the  north,  while  traditional  and  historical
evidenee'eoncur  in  assigning  to  the  Cherokee  as  their  early  home  the
region  about  the  headwaters  of  the  Ohio,  immediately  to  the  south-
ward of  their  kinsmen,  but  bitter  enemies,  the  Iroquois.  The  theory
which  brings  the  Cherokee  from  northern  Iowa  and  the  Iroquois  from
Manitoba  is  unworthy  of  serious  consideration.  (4)

18  MYTHS    OF    THE    CHEROKEE  i   unr.U
the  Delaware  tradition  of  the  expulsion  of  the  Talligewi  from  the  north,
:i-  firsl  noted  by  the  missionary  Heckewelder  in  L819,  and  published
more  l'ull\  by  Brinton  in  the  Walam  Olum  in  L885.  According  t<> the  firsl  account,  the  Delawares,  advancing  from  the  west,  found  their
further  progress  opposed  by  a  powerful  people  called  Alligewi  or  Tal-
ligcw  i.  occupying  the  country  upon  a  river  which  Heckewelder  thinks
identical  with  the  Mississippi,  but  which  the  sequel  shows  was  more
probably  the  upper  Ohio.  They  wen'  said  to  have  regularly  built
earthen  fortifications,  in  which  they  defended  themselves  so  well
that  at  la-t  the  Delawares  were  obliged  to  seek  the  assistance  of  the
"Mengwe,"or  Iroquois,  with  the  result  that  aftera  warfare  extending
over  many  years  the  Alligewi  finally  received  a  crushing  defeat,  the
survivors  fleeing  down  the  river  and  abandoning  the  country  to  the
invaders,  who  thereupon  parceled  it  out  amongst  themselves,  the
■*  Mengwe"  choosing  the  portion  a  I  unit  the  I  rreal  lakes  while  the  Dela-
wares took  possession  of  that  to  the  south  and  cast.  The  missionary
adds  that  the  Allegheny  (and  Ohio)  river  was  still  called  by  the  Dela-
wares the  Alligewi  Sipu,  or  river  of  the  Alligewi.  This  would  seem
to  indicate  it  as  the  true  river  of  the  tradition.  He  speaks  also  of
remarkable  earthworks  seen  by  him  in  1 7^'-»  in  the  neighborhood  of
Lake  Erie,  which  were  said  by  the  Indians  to  have  been  built  by  the
extirpated  tribe  as  defensive  fortifications  in  the  course  < if  this  war.
Near  two  of  these,  in  the  vicinity  of  Sandusky,  he  was  shown  mounds
under  which  it  was  said  some  hundreds  of  the  slain  Talligewi  were
buried.1  As  is  usual  in  such  traditions,  the  Alligewi  were  said  to  have
been  of  gianl  stature,  far  exceeding  their  conquerors  in  size.
In  the  Walam  Olum.  which  is.  it  is  asserted,  a  metrical  translation  of
an  ancient  hieroglyphic  bark  record  discovered  in  L820,  the  main  tra-
dition is  given  in  practically  the  same  way.  with  an  appendix  which
follows  the  fortunes  of  the  defeated  tribe  up  to  the  beginning  of  the
historic  period,  thus  completing  the  chain  of  evidence.  (."■) In  the  Walam  Olum  also  we  find  the  Delawares  advancing  from  the
wesl  or  northwest  until  they  come  to  "Fish  river"'— the  same  which
Heckewelder  make-  the  Mississippi  (6).  On  the  other  side,  we  are
told.    •■The   Talligewi    possessed    the    East."     The    Delaware    chief
'•desired   the   eastern    land,"  and  some  of  his  ]   pie  go  on.  hut  are
killed  by  the  Talligewi.  The  Delawares  decide  upon  war  and  call  in
the  help  of  their  northern  friends,  the  "Talamatan,"  i.  e.,  the  Wyan-
dot and  other  allied  Iroquoian  tribes.  A  war  ensues  which  continues
through  the  terms  of  four  successive  chiefs,  when  victory  declares  for  the
invaders, and  "  all  the  Talega  go  south."  The  country  is  then  divided,
the  Talamatan  taking- the  northern  portion,  while  the  Delawares  "-ta\
south  of  the  lakes."  The  chronicle  proceeds  to  tell  how.  after  eleven
more  chiefs  have  ruled,  the  Nanticokeand  Shawano  separate  from  the

parent  tribe  and  remove  to  the  south.  Six  other  chiefs  follow  in  suc-
cession until  we  come  to  the  seventh,  who  "went  to  theTalega  moun-
tains." By  this  time  the  Delawares  have  reached  the  ocean.  Other
chiefs  succeed,  after  whom  "the  Easterners  and  the  Wolves"  prob-
ably the  Mahican  or  Wappinger  and  the  Munsee — move  off  to  the
northeast.  At  last,  after  six  more  chiefs,  "the  whites  came  on  the
eastern  sea."  by  which  is  probably  meant  the  landing-  of  the  Dutch  on
.Manhattan  in  1609  (7).  We  may  consider  this  a  tally  date,  approxi-
mating the  beginning  of  the  seventeenth  century.  Two  more  chiefs
rule,  and  of  the  second  we  are  told  that  "He  fought  at  the  south:  he
fought  in  the  land  of  theTalega  and  Koweta,"  and  again  the  fourth
chief  after  the  coming  of  the  whites  "went  to  the  Talega."  We  have*
thus  a  traditional  record  of  a  war  of  conquest  carried  on  against  the
Talligewi  by  four  successive  chiefs,  and  a  succession  of  about  twenty-
five  chiefs  between  the  final  expulsion  of  that  tribe  and  the  appearance
of  the  whites,  in  which  interval  the  Nantieoke,  Shawano.  .Mahican.
and  Munsee  branched  oil'  from  the  parent  tribe  of  the  Delawares. Without  venturing  to  entangle  ourselves  in  the  devious  maze  of  Indian
chronology,  it  is  sufficient  to  note  that  all  this  implies  a  very  long  period
of  timt — so  long,  in  fact,  that  during  it  several  new  tribes,  each  of
which  in  time  developed  a  distinct  dialect,  branch  off  from  the  main
Lenape'  stem.  It  is  distinctly  stated  that  all  the  Talega  went  south
after  their  final  defeat:  and  from  later  references  we  rind  that  they  took
refuge  in  the  mountain  country  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  Koweta
(the  Creeks),  and  that  Delaware  war  parties  were  still  making  raids
upon  both  these  tribes  long  after  the  first  appearance  of  the  whites.
Although  at  first  glance  it  might  be  thought  that  the  name  Tallige-wi
is  but  a  corruption  of  Tsalagi,  a  closer  study  leads  to  the  opinion  that  it
is  a  true  Delaware  word,  in  all  probability  connected  with  iruhJ,  or
walok,  signifying  a  cave  or  hole  (Zeisberger),  whence  we  rind  in  the
Walani  Olum  the  word  oligonunk  rendered  as  "at  the  place  of  caves." It  would  thus  be  an  exact  Delaware  rendering  of  the  same  name,
"people  of  the  cave  country."  by  which,  as  we  have  seen,  the  Chero-
kee were  commonly  known  among  the  tribes.  Whatever  may  be  the
origin  of  the  name  itself,  there  can  be  no  reasonable  doubt  as  to  it~
application.  "Name,  location,  and  legends  combine  to  identify  the Cherokees  or  Tsalaki  with  the  Tallike:  and  this  is  as  much  evidence  as
we  can  expect  to  produce  in  such  researches."1 The  Wyandot  confirm  the  Delaware  story  and  fix  the  identification  of
the  expelled  tribe.  According  to  their  tradition,  as  narrated  in  1802,
the  ancient  fortifications  in  the  Ohio  valley  had  been  erected  in  the
course  of  a  long  war  between  themselves  and  tin  'Cherokee,  which
resulted  finally  in  the  defeat  of  the  latter. '

supplement  and  corroborate  those  of  the  northern  tribes,  thus  bring-

the  Tennessee  in  the  rich  valleys  of  the  southern  Aileghenies.  <  >wing
to  the  Cherokee  predilection  for  new  gods,  contrasting  strongly  with
tin  conservatism  of  the  Iroquois,  their  ritual  forms  and  national  epics
had  fallen  into  decay  even  before  tin'  Revolution,  a-  we  learn  from
Adair.  Some  vestiges  of  their  migration  legend  still  existed  in  Hay-
wood's time,  but  it  is  now  completely  Forgotten  both  in  the  East  ami in  the  West.
According' to  Haywood,  who  wrote  in  1823  on  information  obtained
directly  from  leading  members  of  the  tribe  long  before  the  Removal,
the  Cherokee  formerly  had  alone-  migration  lee-end.  which  was  already
lost,  hut  which,  within  the  memory  of  the  mother  of  one  informant
say  about  L750  was  still  recited  by  chosen  orators  on  the  occasion  of
the  annual  green-corn  dance.  This  migration  lee-end  appears  to  have
resembled  that  of  the  Delawares  and  the  Creeks  in  beginning  with
genesis  ami  the  period  of  animal  monsters,  and  thence  following  the
shifting  fortune  of  the  chosen  hand  to  the  historic  period.  The  tradi-
tion recited  that  they  had  originated  in  a  land  toward  the  rising  sun.
where  they  had  been  placed  by  the  command  of  ••the  four  councils
sent  from  above."  In  this  pristine  home  were  great  snakes  and  water
monsters,  for  which  reason  it  was  supposed  to  have  been  near  the  sea
coast,  although  the  assumption  is  not  a  necessary  corollary,  as  these
are  a  feature  of  the  mythology  of  all  the  eastern  tribes.  After  this
genesis  period  there  began  a  slow  migration,  during  which  "towns  of
people  in  many  nights*  encampment  removed,"  but  no  details  are  given.
From  Heckewelder  it  appears  that  the  expression,  "a  night's  encamp-
ment." which  occurs  also  in  the  Delaware  migration  legend,  is  an  Indian
figure  of  speech  for  a  halt  of  one  year  at  a  place.1
In  another  place  Haywood  says,  although  apparently  confusing  the
chronologic  order  of  events:  ■"One  tradition  which  they  have  amongst them  says  they  came  from  the  west  ami  exterminated  the  former
inhabitants;  and  then  says  they  came  from  the  upper  parts  of  the
Ohio,  where  they  erected  the  mounds  on  Crave  creek,  and  that  they
removed  thither  from  the  country  where  Monticello  (near  Charlottes-
ville. Virginia)  is  situated."8  The  first  reference  is  to  the  celebrated
mounds  on  the  ( )hio  near  Moundsville,  below  Wheeling.  West  Virginia;
the  other  is  doubtless  to  a  noted  burial  mound  described  by  Jefferson
in  17sl  as  then  existing  near  his  home,  on  the  low  groundsof  Kivanua
river  opposite  the  site  of  an  ancient  Indian  town.  He  himself  had
opened  it  and  found  it  to  contain  perhaps  a  thousand  disjointed
skeletons  of  hoth  adults  and  children,  the  bones  piled  in  successive
layers,  those  near  the  to])  being  least  decayed.     They  showed  no  signs

of  violence,  but  were  evidently  the  accumulation  of  long  years  from
the  neighboring  Indian  town.  The  distinguished  writer  adds:  "But
on  whatever  occasion  they  may  have  been  made,  they  are  of  consider-
able notoriety  among  the  Indians:  for  a  party  passing,  about  thirty
years  ago  [i.  e.,  about  L750],  through  the  part  of  the  country  where
this  barrow  is.  went  through  the  woods  directly  to  it  without  any
instructions  or  enquiry,  and  having  staid  about  it  some  time,  with
expressions  which  were  construed  to  be  those  of  sorrow,  they  returned
to  the  high  road,  which  they  had  left  about  half  a  dozen  miles  to  pay
this  visit,  and  pursued  their  journey."1  Although  the  tribe  is  not named,  the  Indians  were  probably  Cherokee,  as  no  other  southern
Indians  were  then  accustomed  to  range  in  that  section.  As  serving  to
corroborate  this  opinion  we  have  the  statement  of  a  prominent  Cher-
okee chief,  given  to  Schoolcraft  in  1846,  that  acccording  to  their  tradi-
tion his  people  had  formerly  lived  at  the  Peaks  of  Otter,  in  Virginia,
a  noted  landmark  of  the  Blue  ridge,  near  the  point  where  Staunton
river  breaks  through  the  mountains.2
From  a  candid  sifting  of  the  evidence  Haywood  concludes  that  the
authors  of  the  most  ancient  remains  in  Tennessee  had  spread  over  that
region  from  the  south  and  southwest  at  a  very  early  period,  hut  that
the  later  occupants,  the  Cherokee,  had  entered  it  from  the  north  and
northeast  in  comparatively  recent  times,  overrunning  and  exterminat-
ing the  aborigines.  He  declares  that  the  historical  fact  seems  to  be
established  that  the  Cherokee  entered  the  country  from  Virginia,  mak-
ing temporary  settlements  upon  New  river  and  the  upper  Holston,
until,  under  the  continued  hostile  pressure  from  the  north,  they  were
again  forced  to  remove  farther  to  the  south,  fixing  themselves  upon  the
Little  Tennessee,  in  what  afterward  became  known  asthe  middle  towns.
By  a  leading  mixed  blood  of  the  tribe  he  was  informed  that  they  had
made  their  first  settlements  within  their  modern  home  territory  upon
Nolichucky  river,  and  that,  having  lived  the-re  for  a  long  period,  they
could  give  no  definite  account  of  an  earlier  location.  Echota,  their
capital  and  peace  town,  "claimed  to  be  the  eldest  brother  in  the  nation,"
and  the  claim  was  generally  acknowledged.  In  confirmation  of  the
statement  as  to  an  early  occupancy  of  the  upper  Holston  region,  it  may
he  noted  that  "  Watauga*  )ld  Fields,"  now  Elizabeth  town,  were  so  called
from  the  fact  that  when  the  first  white  settlement  within  the  present
state  of  Tennessee  was  begun  there,  so  early  as  1769,  the  bottom  lands
were  found  to  contain  graves  and  other  numerous  ancient  remains  of  a
former  Indian  town  which  tradition  ascribed  to  the  Cherokee,  whose
nearest  settlements  were  then  many  miles  to  the  southward.

Ohio,  the j  yet,  according  to  Haywood,  expressly  disclaimed  the  author-
ship of  the  very  numerous  mounds  and  petroglyphs  in  their  later  home
territory,  asserting  that  these  ancient  works  had  exhibited  the  same
appearance  when  they  themselves  had  first  occupied  the  region.1  This
accords  with  Bartram's  statement  that  the  Cherokee,  although  some-
times utilizing  the  mounds  as  sites  for  their  own  town  houses,  were  a-
ignoranl  as  the  whites  of  their  origin  or  purpose,  having  only  a  gen
era!  tradition  that  their  forefathers  had  found  them  in  much  the  same
condition  on  first  coming  into  the  country.8
Although,  as  has  been  noted.  Haywood  expresses  the  opinion  that
the  invading  Cherokee  had  overrun  and  exterminated  the  earlier
inhabitants,  lie  says  in  another  place,  on  halfbreed  authority,  that
the  newcomers  found  no  Indians  upon  the  waters  of  the  Tennessee,
with  the  exception  of  some  Creeks  living  upon  that  river,  near  the
mouth  of  the  Hiwassee,  the  main  body  of  that  tribe  being  established
up   md   claiming  all   the   streams  to   the   southward.3     There   is
considerable  evidence  that  the  Creek-  preceded  the  Cherokee,  and
within  the  last  century  they  still  claimed  the  Tennessee,  or  at  least
the  Tennessee  watershed,  for  their  northern  boundary.
There  is  a  dim  bul  persistent  tradition  of  a  strange  white  race  pre-
ceding the  (  'herokee.  .-onie  of  the  Molic-  e\  ell  going  SO  far  as  to  locate their  former  settlements  and  to  identify  them  as  the  authors  of  the
ancient  works  found  in  the  country.  The  earliest  reference  appeal's
to  he  that  of  Barton  in  1797,  on  the  statement  of  a  gentleman  whom
he  quotes  as  a  valuable  authority  upon  the  southern  tribes.  "The
Cheerake  tell  us,  that  when  they  first  arrived  in  the  country  which
they  inhabit,  they  found  it  possessed  by  certain  •moon-eyed  people,'
who  could  not  see  in  the  day-time.  These  wretches  they  expelled."
He  seems  to  consider  them  an  albino  race.'  Haywood,  twenty-six
years  later,  says  that  the  invading  Cherokee  found  "white  people"
near  the  head  of  the  Little  Tennessee,  with  forts  extending  thence  down
the  Tennessee  as  far  as  Chickamauga  creek.  He  gives  the  location  of
three  of  these  forts.  The  Cherokee  made  war  against  them  and
drove  them  to  the  mouth  of  Big  Chickamauga  creek,  when'  they
entered  into  a  treaty  and  agreed  to  remove  if  permitted  to  depart  in
peace.  Permission  being  granted,  they  abandoned  the  country.  Else-

of  upright  logs,  covered  with  earth  which  had  been  dug  out  from  the
inside.1 Harry  Smith,  a  halfhreed  born  about  1815,  father  of  the  late  chief
of  the  East  Cherokee,  informed  the  author  that  when  a  boy  he  had
been  told  by  an  old  woman  a  tradition  of  a  race  of  very  small  people,
perfectly  white,  who  once  came  and  lived  for  some  time  on  the  site  of
the  ancient  mound  on  the  northern  side  of  Hiwassee,  at  the  mouth  of
Peachtree  creek,  a  few  miles  above  the  present  Murphy,  North  Caro-
lina. They  afterward  removed  to  the  West.  Colonel  Thomas,  the
white  chief  of  the  East  Cherokee,  horn  about  the  beginning  of  the
century,  had  also  heard  a  tradition  of  another  race  of  people,  who
lived  on  Hiwassee.  opposite  the  present  Murphy,  and  warned  the
Cherokee  that  they  must  not  attempt  to  cross  over  to  the  south  side
of  the  river  or  the  great  leech  in  the  water  would  swallow  them.2
They  finally  went  west,  •"long  before  the  whites  came"  The  two stories  are  plainly  the  same,  although  told  independently  and  many
miles  apart.
The  Period  of  Spanish  Exploration — 1540-1
The  definite  history  of  the  Cherokee  begins  with  the  year  1540,  at
which  date  we  find  them  already  established,  where  they  were  always
afterward  known,  in  the  mountains  of  Carolina  and  Georgia.  The
earliest  Spanish  adventurers  failed  to  penetrate  so  far  into  the  intf  rior,
and  the  first  entry  into  their  country  was  made  by  De  Soto,  advancing
up  the  Savannah  on  his  fruitless  quest  for  gold,  in  May  of  that  year.
While  at  Cofitachiqui.  an  important  Indian  town  on  the  lower
Savannah  governed  by  a  " queen,"  the  Spaniards  had  found  hatchets
and  other  objects  of  copper,  some  of  which  was  of  finer  color  and
appeared  to  be  mixed  with  gold,  although  they  had  no  means  of  testing
it.3  On  inquiry  they  were  told  that  the  metal  had  come  from  an  interior
mountain  province  called  Chisca,  hut  the  country  was  represented  as
thinly  peopled  and  the  way  as  impassable  for  horses.  Some  time  before,
while  advancing  through  eastern  Georgia,  they  had  heard  also  of  a
rich  and  plentiful  province  called  Coca,  toward  the  northwest,  and  by
the  people  of  Cofitachiqui  they  were  now  told  that  Chiaha,  the  nearest
town  of  Coca  province,  was  twelve  days  inland.  As  both  men  and
animals  were  already  nearly  exhausted  from  hunger  and  hard  travel,
and  the  Indians  either  could  not  or  would  not  furnish  sufficient  pro-
vision for  their  needs,  De  Soto  determined  not  to  attempt  the  passage
of  the  mountains  then,  but  to  push  on  at  once  to  Coca,  there  to  rest
and  recuperate  before  undertaking  further  exploration.     In  the  mean-

time  he  hoped  :i  1 — < >  to  obtain  inure  definite  information  concerning  the
mines.  As  the  chief  puipose  of  the  expedition  was  the  discovery  of
the  mines,  many  of  the  officers  regarded  tin-  change  of  plan  a-  a
mistake,  and  favored  staying  where  they  were  until  the  ae\i  crop
should  !><■  ripened,  then  to  go  directly  into  the  mountains,  but  as  the
general  was  "a  stern  man  and  of  few  words,"  none  ventured  to  oppose
his  resolution.1  The  province  of  ( loca  was  the  territory  of  the  ( !reek
Indians,  called  Ani'-Kusa  by  the  <  Iherokee,  from  EZusa,  or  <  !oosa,  their
ancienl   capital,  while  Chiaha  was  identical  with  Chehaw,  01   f  the
principal  Creek  towns  on  Chattahoochee  river.  Cofitachiqui  may
have  Keen  the  capital  of  the  LTchee  Indians.
The  outrageous  conduct  of  the  Spaniards  had  bo  angered  the  Indian
queen  thai  she  now  refused  i<>  furnish  guides  and  carriers,  whereupon
l>e  Sot<>  made  her  a  prisoner,  with  the  design  of  compelling  her  to  act
as  guide  herself,  and  at  the  same  time  to  use  her  as  a  hostage  to  com-
mand the  obedience  pf  her  subjects,     instead,  however,  of  (   lucting
the  Spaniards  by  the  direct  trail  toward  the  west,  she  led  them  far
out  Hi'  their  course  until  she  finally  managed  to  make  her  escape, leaving  them  to  find  their  way  out  of  the  mountain.--  as  best  they  could.
Departing  from  Cofitachiqui,  they  turned  tirst  toward  the  north,
passing  through  several  towns  subject  to  the  queen,  to  whom,  although
a  pris   r.  the  Indians  everywhere  showed  great  respect  and  obe-
dience, furnishing  whatever  assistance  the  Spaniards  compelled  her  to
demand  for  their  own  purposes.  In  a  few  day-  they  came  to  "a
province  called  Chalaque,"  the  territory  of  the  Cherokee  Indians.
probably  upon  the  waters  of  Keowee  river,  the  eastern  head-stream
of  the  Savannah.  It  is  described  as  the  poorest  country  for  corn  that
they  had  yet  seen,  the  inhabitants  subsisting  on  wild  root-  and
herbs  and  on  game  which  they  killed  with  bows  and  arrows.  They
were  naked,  lean,  and  unwarlike.  The  country  abounded  in  wild
turkeys  ("gallinas"),  which  the  people  gave  very  freely  to  the
strangers,  one  town  presenting  them  with  seven  hundred.  A  chief
also  gave  De  Soto  two  deerskins  a-  a  great  present.'  Garcilaso,  writ-
ing on  the  authority  of  an  old  soldier  nearly  fifty  years  afterward,
says  that  the  "Chalaques"  deserted  their  towns  on  the  approach  of
the  white  men  and  lied  to  the  mountains,  leaving  behind  only  old  men
and  women  and  some  who  were  nearly  blind.3  Although  it  was  too
early  for  the  new  crop,  the  poverty  of  the  people  may  have  been
more  apparent  than  real,  due  to  their  unwillingness  to  give  any  part
of  their  stored-up  provision  to  the  unwelcome  strangers.  As  the
Spaniards  were  greatly  in  need  of.  corn  for  themselves  ami  their
horses,  they  made  no  stay,  hut  hurried  on.     In  a  few  days  they  arrived

at  Guaquili,  which  is  mentioned  only  by  Ranjel,  who  does  not  specify
whether  it  was  a  town  or  a  province— i.  e.,  a  tribal  territory.  It  was
probably  a  small  town.  Here  they  were  welcomed  in  a  friendly  man-
ner, the  Indians  giving  them  a  little  corn  and  many  wild  turkeys,
together  with  some  dogs  of  a  peculiar  small  species,  which  were  bred
for  eating  purposes  and  did  not  bark.1  They  were  also  supplied  with
men  to  help  carry  the  baggage.     The  name  Guaquili  has  a  Cherokee
sound  and  may  be  connected  with  wa'guli',  "whipj   rwill,"  uicd'gili,
" f oam,"  or  gill,  "dog."  1/
Traveling  still  toward  the  north,  they  arrived  a  day  or  two  later  in
the  province  of  Xuala,  in  which  we  recognize  the  territory  of  the
Suwali,  Sara,  or  Cheraw  Indians,  in  the  piedmont  region  about  the
head  of  Broad  river  in  North  Carolina.  Garcilaso,  who  did  not  sec  it.
represents  it  as  a  rich  country,  while  the  Elvas  narrative  and  Biedma
agree  that  it  was  a  rough,  broken  country,  thinly  inhabited  and  poor
in  provision.  According  to  Garcilaso,  it  was  under  the  rule  of  the
queen  of  Cofitachiqui,  although  a  distinct  province  in  itself.2  The
principal  town  was  beside  a  small  rapid  stream,  (lose  under  a  moun-
tain. The  chief  received  them  in  friendly  fashion.  giving  them  corn,
dogs  of  the  small  breed  already  mentioned,  carrying  baskets,  and  bur-
den bearers.  The  country  roundabout  showed  greater  indication-  of
gold  mines  than  any  they  had  yet  seen.1
Here  De  Soto  turned  to  the  west,  crossing  a  very  high  mountain
ranee,  which  appears  to  have  been  the  Blue  ridge,  and  descending  on
'tin'  other  side  to  a  stream  flowing  in  the  opposite  direction,  which
was  probably  one  id'  the  upper  tributaries  of  the  French  Broad.3
Although  it  was  late  in  May,  they  found  it  very  cold  in  the  moun-
tains.* After  several  days  of  such  travel  they  arrived,  about  the  end
of  the  month,  at  the  town  of  Guasili,  or  Guaxule.  The  chief  and
principal  men  came  out  some  distance  to  welcome  them,  dressed  in
tine  robes  of  skins,  with  feather  head-dresses,  after  the  fashion  of  the
country.  Before  reaching  this  point  the  queen  had  managed  to  make
her  escape,  together  with  three  slaves  of  the  Spaniards,  and  the  last
that  was  heard  of  her  was  that  she  was  on  her  way  back  to  her  own
country  with  one  of  the  runaways  as  her  husband.  What  grieved
De  Soto  most  in  the  matter  was  that  she  took  with  her  a  small  box  of
pearls,  which  he  had  intended  to  take.from  her  before  releasing  her.
but  had  left  with  her  for  the  present  in  order  •"not  to  discontent
hei-  altogether."
Guaxule  is  described  as  a  very  large  town  surrounded  by  a  number
of  small  mountain  streams  which  united  to  form  the  large  river  down
which   the  Spaniard-   proceeded   after   leaving  the   place.6     Here,  as

pitality    -ii  much  so  thai  the  nan   E  Guaxule  became  to  the  army  a
synonym  for  good  fortune.1  Among  other  things  they  gave  the  Span-
iards 3   logs  for  f   I,  although,  according  to  the  Elvas  narrative,
the  Indian-  themselves  did  qoI  ea<  them.8  The  principal  officers  of
the  expedition  were  lodged  in  the  "chief's  house,"  bj  which  we  are  to
understand  the  townhouse,  which  was  upon  a  high  hill  with  a  roadway
to  the  top.3     From  a  close  study  of  the  narrative  it  appears  that  this
"hill"  was     ther   than    the  greal    Nacoochee    mound,   in   White
county,  Georgia,  a  few  miles  northwest  of  the  present  Clarkesville.'
It  was  within  the  Cherokee  territory,  and  the  town  was  probably  a
settlement  of  thai  tribe.  From  here  De  Soto  senl  runners  ahead  to
notify  the  chief  of  ( !hiaha  of  his  approach,  in  order  that  sufficienl  corn
might  he  ready  mi  his  arrival.
Leaving  <  ruaxule,  they  proceeded  down  the  river,  w  hich  we  identify
with  the  Chattahoochee,  and  in  two  days  arrived  at  Canasoga,  or  Cana-
sagua,  a  frontier  town  of  the  Cherokee.  As  they  neared  the  town
the\  were  met  i>\  the  Indians,  bearing  baskets  of  "mulberries,"5  more
probably  the  delicious  service-berry  of  the  southern  mountains,  which
ripens  in  early  summer,  while  the  mulberry  matures  later.
From  here  they  continued  down  the  river,  which  grew  constantly
larger,  through  an  uninhabited  country  which  formed  the  disputed
territory  between  the  Cherokee  and  the  Creeks.  About  five  days  after
leaving  Canasagua  they  were  met  by  messengers,  who  escorted  them
to  ( 'hiaha.  the  first  town  of  the  province  of  Coca.  De  Soto  had  crossed the  state  of  Georgia,  leaving  the  Cherokee  country  behind  him.  ami
was  now  an  lone-  the  Lower  ( 'reeks,  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  present
Columbus,  Georgia.6  With  his  subsequent  wanderings  after  crossing
the  Chattahoochee  into  Alabama  and  beyond  we  need  not  concern
ourselves  (8).
While  resting  at  Chiaha  De  Soto  met  with  a  chief  who  confirmed
what  the  Spaniards  had  heard  before  concerning  mines  in  theproi  ince
of  Chisca,  saying  that  there  was  there  "a  melting  of  copper"and  of another  metal  of  about  the  same  color,  but  softer,  ami  therefore  not  -o
much  used.7  The  province  was  northward  from  Chiaha.  soinew  here  in
upper  Georgia  or  the  adjacent  part  of  Alabama  or  Tennessee,  through
all  of  which  mountain  region  native  copper  is  found.  The  other
mineral,  which  the  Spaniards  understood  to  he  gold,  may  have  been
iron  pyrites,  although  there  is  some  evidence  that  the  Indians  occa-
sionally found  and  shaped  gold  nuggets.'

Accordingly  two  soldiers  were  sent  on  foot  with  Indian  guides  to
find  Chisca  ;m<l  learn  the  truth  of  the  stories.     They  rejoined  the  army
some  time  after  the  march  had  I   n  resumed,  and  reported  according
to  the  Elvas  chronicler,  that  their  guides  had  taken  them  through  a
country  so  poor  in  corn,  so  rough,  and  over  so  high  mountains  that  it
would  be  impossible  for  the  army  to  follow,  wherefore,  as  the  way
grew  long  and  lingering,  they  had  turned  back  after  reaching  a  little
poor  town  where  the}'  saw  nothing  that  was  of  any  profit.  They
brought  back  with  them  a  dressed  buffalo  skin  which  the  Indians  there
had  given  them,  the  first  ever  obtained  by  white  men.  and  described  in
the  quaint  old  chronicle  as  "  an  ox  hide  as  thin  as  a  calf's  skin,  and  the
hair  like  a  soft  wool  between  the  coarse  and  tine  wool  of  sheep."1
( rarcilaso's  glowing  narrative  gives  a  somewhat  different  impression.
According  to  this  author  the  scouts  returned  full  of  enthusiasm  for
the  fertility  of  the  country,  and  reported  that  the  mines  were  of  a  tine
species  of  copper,  and  had  indications  also  of  gold  and  silver,  while
their  progress  from  one  town  to  another  had  been  a  continual  series  of
feastings  and  Indian  hospitalities.2  However  that  may  have  been,
De  Solo  made  no  further  effort  to  reach  the  Cherokee  mines,  but  con-
tinued his  course  westward  through  the  Creek  country,  having  spent
altogether  a  month  in  the  mountain  region.
There  is  no  record  of  any  second  attempt  to  penetrate  the  Cherokee
country  for  twenty-six  years  (!l).  In  1561  the  Spaniards  took  formal
possession  of  the  hay  of  Santa  Elena,  now  Saint  Helena,  near  Port
Royal,  on  the  coast  of  South  Carolina.  The  next  year  the  French
made  an  unsuccessful  attempt  at  settlement  at  the  same  place,  and  in
1566  Menendez  made  the  Spanish  occupancy  sure  by  establishing  there
a  fort  which  he  called  San  Felipe.3  In  November  of  that  year  Captain
.1  uan  I'ai'do  was  sent  with  a  party  from  the  fort  to  explore  the  interior.
Accompanied  by  the  chief  of  "Juada"  (which  from  Vandera's  narra-
tive we  find  should  be  "Joara,"  i.e..  the  Sara  Indians  already  men-
tioned in  the  De  Soto  chronicle),  he  proceeded  as  far  as  the  territory  of
that  tribe,  where  he  built  a  fort,  hut  on  account  of  the  snow  in  the
mountains  did  not  think  it  advisable  to  go  farther,  and  returned.
leaving  a  sergeant  with  thirty  soldiers  to  garrison  the  post.  Soon
after  his  return  he  received  a  letter  from  the  sergeant  stating  that  the
chief  of  Chisca—  the  rich  mining  country  of  which  De  Soto  had  heard —
was  very  hostile  to  the  Spaniards,  and  that  in  a  recent  battle  the  latter
had  killed  a  thousand  of  his  Indians  and  burned  fifty  houses  with
almost  no  damage  to  themselves.  Either  the  sergeant  or  his  chronicler
must  have  been  an  unconscionable  liar,  as  it  was  asserted  that  all  this
was  done  with  only  fifteen  men.  Immediately  afterward,  according
to  the  same  story,  the  sergeant  marched  with  twenty  men  about  a  day's

distance  in  the  mountains  against  another  hostile  chief,  whom  he  found
in  a  Btrongly  palisaded  town,  which,  after  a  hard  fight,  he  and  his  men
stormed  and  burned,  killing  fifteen  hundred  Indians  without  losing  a
single  man  themselves.  Under  instructions  Erom  his  superior  officer,
the  sergeant  with  his  small  party  then  proceeded  to  explore  what  lay
bej   I.  and.  taking  a  road  which  the}  were  told  led  to  the  territory
of  a  ureal  chief,  after  lour  day-  of  hard  marching  they  came  to  his
tow  ii.  called  Chiaha  (Chicha,  by  mistake  in  the  manuscript  transla-
tion), the  same  where  De  Soto  had  rested.  It  i-  described  at  this  time
as  palisaded  and  strongly  fortified,  with  a  deep  river  on  each  side,  and
defended  by  over  three  thousand  fighting  men.  there  being  no  women
or  children  among  them.  It  is  possible  that  in  view  of  their  former
experience  with  the  Spaniards,  (lie  Indian-  had  sent  their  families
awa\  from  the  town,  while  at  the  same  time  they  may  have  summoned
warrior-  from  the  neighboring  Creek  town-  in  order  to  be  prepared
for  any  emergency.  However,  as  before,  they  received  the  white
men  with  the  greatest  kindness,  and  the  Spaniard-  continued  for
twelve  day-  through  the  territories  of  the  same  tribe  until  thej  arrived
at  the  principal  town  (Kusa?),  where.  by  the  imitation  of  the  chief,
they  huilt  a  small  fort  and  awaited  the  coming  of  Pardo,  who  was
expected  to  follow  with  a  larger  force  from  Santa  Elena,  as  he  did  in
the  summer  of  1567,  being  met  on  hi-  arrival  with  every  -how  ,>i
hospitality  from  the  Creek  chief  s.  This  second  fort  was  said  to  he  one
hundred  and  fortj  leagues  distant  from  that  in  the  Sara  country,  which
latter  was  called  one  hundred  and  twenty  Leagues  fr    Santa  Ciena.3
In  the  summer  of  1567,  according  to  previous  agreement,  Captain
Pardo  left  the  fort  at  Santa  Elena  with  a  -mall  detachment  of  troops,
and  after  a  week's  travel,  sleeping  each  night  at  a  different  Indian
town,  arrived  at  "Canos,  which  the  Indian-  call  ( 'anosi.  and  by  another
name,  Cofetacque"  (the  Cofitachiqui  of  the  De  Soto  chronicle),
which  is  described  as  situated  in  a  favorable  location  for  a  large  city.
fifty  leagues  from  Santa   Elena,  to  which  tl   asiest   road  was  by  a
river  (the  Savannah)  which  flowed  by  the  town,  or  by  another  which
they  had  passed  ten  Leagues  farther  back.  Proceeding,  they  passed
Jagaya,  Gueza,  and  Arauchi,  and  arrived  at  Otariyatiqui,  or  Otari,
in  which  we- have  perhaps  the  Cherokee  d'tdri  or  d'tdli,  "mountain".
It  may  have  been  a  frontier  Cherokee  settlement,  and.  according  to
the  old  chronicler,  its  chief  and  Language  ruled  much  good  country.
From  here  a  trail  went  northward  to  Cuatari.  Sauxpa.  and  L'si.  i.  e.,

Leaving  Otariyatiqui,  they  went  on  to  Quinahaqui,  and  then,  turn

with  his  sergeant  on  his  first  trip."  This,  us  has  been  noted,  was  the
Xuala  of  the  De  Soto  chronicle,  the  territory  of  the  Sara  Indians,  in
the  foothills  of  the  Blue  ridge,  southeast  from  the  present  Asheville,
North  Carolina.  Vandera  makes  it  one  hundred  leagues  from  Santa
Elena,  while  Martinez,  already  quoted,  makes  the  distance  one  hundred
and  twenty  leagues.  The  difference  is  not  important,  as  both  state-
ments were  only  estimates.  From  there  they  followed  "along  the
mountains"  to  Tocax  (Toxaway?),  Cauchi  (Nacoochee?),  and  Tanas-
qui — apparently  Cherokee  towns,  although  the  forms  can  not  be  iden-
tified— and  after  resting  three  days  at  the  last-named  place  went  on
"to  Solameco,  otherwise  called  Chiaha."  where  the  sergeant  met  them.
The  combined  forces  afterward  went  on,  through  Cpssa  (Kusa),  Tas-
quiqui  (Taskigi).  and  other  Creek  towns,  as  far  as  Tascaluza,  in  the
Alabama  country,  and  returned  thence  to  Santa  Elena,  having  appar-
ently met  with  a  friendly  reception  everywhere  along  the  route.
From  Cofitachiqui  to  Tascaluza  they  went  over  about  the  same  road
traversed  by  De  Soto  in  1540. "
We  come  now  to  a  great  gap  of  nearly  a  century.  Shea  has  a  notice
of  a  Spanish  mission  founded  among  the  Cherokee  in  1643  and  still
flourishing  when  visited  by  an  English  traveler  ten  years  later.'  but  as his  information  is  derived  entirely  from  the  fraudulent  work  of  Davies,
and  as  no  such  mission  is  mentioned  by  Barcia  in  any  of  these  years,
we  may  regard  the  story  as  spurious  (10).  The  first  mission  work
in  the  tribe  appears  to  have  been  that  of  Priber,  almost  a  hundred
years  later.  Long  before  the  end  of  the  sixteenth  century,  however,
the  existence  of  mines  of  gold  and  other  metals  in  the  Cherokee  country
was  a  matter  of  common  knowledge  among  the  Spaniards  at  St.  Augus-
tine and  Santa  Elena,  and  more  than  one  expedition  had  been  fitted  out
to  explore  the  interior. '  Numerous  traces  of  ancient  mining  opera- tions, with  remains  of  old  shafts  and  fortifications,  evidently  of  Euro-
pean origin,  show  that  these 'discoveries  were  followed  up,  although the  policy  of  Spain  concealed  the  fact  from  the  outside  world.  How
much  permanent  impression  this  early  Spanish  intercourse  made
on  the  Cherokee  il  is  impossible  to  estimate,  but  it  must  have  been
considerable  (11).    ,

It  was  not  until  1654  that  the  English  first  came  into  contact  with
the  Cherokee,  called  in  the  records  of  the  period  Rechahecrians,  a  cor-
ruption of  Rickahockan,  apparently  the  name  by  which  they  were
known  to  the  Powhatan  tribes.  In  that  year  the  Virginia  colony,
which  had  only  recently  concluded  a  long  and  exterminating  war  with
the  Powhatan,  was  thrown  into  alarm  by  the  news  that  a  great  body  of

six  or  seven  hundred  Rechabecrian  [ndians — by  which  is  probably
meant  thai  number  of  warriors  from  the  mountains  had  invaded  the
lower  country  and  established  themselves  at  the  falls  of  James  river,
where  now  is  the  city  of  Richmond.  The  assembly  at  once  passed
resolutions  "thai  these  new  come  Indians  be  in  no  sort  suffered  to  seal
themselves  there,  or  any  place  near  us.  it  having  cost  so  much  blood
to  expel  and  extirpate  those  perfidious  and  treacherous  Indians  which
were  there  formerly."  It  was  therefore  ordered  that  a  force  of  at  least
100  white  men  be  at  once  senl  against  them,  to  be  joined  by  the  war-
riors of  all  the  neighboring  subject  tribes,  according  to  treaty  obliga-
tion. The  Pamunkey  chief ,  with  a  hundred  of  his  men.  responded  to
the  summons,  and  the  combined  force  marched  againsl  the  invaders.
The  result  was  a  bloody  battle,  with  disastrous  outcome  to  the  Vir-
ginians, the  Pamunkey  chief  with  most  ,,f  hi-  men  being  killed,  while
the  whites  were  forced  to  make  such  terms  of  peace  with  the  Recha-
hecrians  that  the  assembly  cashiered  the  commander  of  the  expedition
and  compelled  him  to  pav  the  whole  cost  of  the  treatj  from  his  own
estate.1  Owing  to  the  imperfection  of  the  Virginia  records  we  have
no  means  of  knowing  the  causes  >d'  tin'  sudden  invasion  or  how  long the  invaders  retained  their  position  at  the  falls.  In  all  probability  it
was  only  the  last  of  a  long  series  of  otherwise  unrecorded  irruptions
by  the  mountaineers  on  the  more  peaceful  dwellers  in  the  lowlands.
From  a  remark  in  Ledererit  is  probable  that  the  Cherokee  were  assisted
also  by  some  of  the  piedmont  tribes  hostile  to  the  Powhatan.  The
Peaks  of  Otter,  near  which  the  Cherokee  claim  to  have  once  lived,  as
has  been  already  noted,  are  only  about  one  hundred  miles  in  a  straight
line  from  Richmond,  while  the  burial  mound  and  town  site  near
Charlottesville,  mentioned  by  Jefferson,  are  but  half  that  distance.
In  L655  a  Virginia  expedition  sent  out  from  the  falls  of  James  river
(Richmond)  crossed  over  the  mountains  to  the  large  streams  flowing
into  the  Mississippi.  No  details  are  given  and  the  route  is  uncertain,
hut  whether  or  not  they  met  Indians,  they  must  have  passed  through
Cherokee  territory.2
In  L670  the  German  traveler.  John  Lederer,  went  from  the  falls  of
.lames  river  to  the  Catawba  country  in  South  Carolina,  following  for
most  of  the  distance  the  path  used  by  the  Virginia  traders,  who  already
had  regular  dealings  with  the  southern  tribes,  including  probably  the
Cherokee,      lie  speaks  in  several  places  of  the  Riekahoekan,  which
seems  to  he  a    re  correct  form  than  Rechahecrian.  and  his  narrative
and  the  accompanying  map  put  them  in  the  mountains  of  North  Caro-
lina, back  of  the  Catawba  and  the  Sara  and  southward  from  the  head
of  Roanoke  river.  They  were  apparently  on  hostile  terms  with  the
tribes  to  the  eastward,  and  while  the  traveler  was  stopping  at  an  Indian

village  on  Dan  river,  about  the  present  Clarksville,  Virginia,  a  delega-
tion of  Rickahockan,  which  had  come  on  tribal  business,  was  barba-
rously murdered  at  a  dance  prepared  on  the  night  of  their  arrival  by
their  treacherous  hosts.  On  reaching  the  Catawba  country  he  heard
of  white  men  to  the  southward,  and  incidentally  mentions  that  the
neighboring  mountains  were  called  the  Suala  mountains  by  the  Span-
iards.1 In  the  next  year.  1671,  a  party  from  Virginia  under  Thomas
Batts  explored  the  northern  branch  of  Roanoke  river  and  crossed
over  the  Blue  ridge  to  the  headwaters  of  New  river,  where  they  found
trace-  of  occupancy,  but  do  Indians.  By  this  time  all  the  tribes  of
this  section,  east  of  the  mountains,  were  in  possession  of  firearms.2
The  first  permanent  English  settlement  in  South  Carolina  was  estab-
lished in  L670.  In  L690  .lames  Moore,  secretary  of  the  colony,  made
an  exploring  expedition  into  the  mountains  and  reached  a  point  at
which,  according  to  his  Indian  guides,  he  was  within  twenty  miles  of
where  the  Spaniards  were  engaged  in  mining  and  smelting  with  bel-
lows and  furnaces,  but  on  account  of  some  misunderstanding  he
returned  without  visiting  the  place,  although  he  procured  specimens
of  ores,  which  he  sent  to  England  for  assay.3  It  may  have  been  in  the
neighborhood  of  the  presenl  Lincolnton,  North  Carolina,  where  a  dam
of  cut  stone  and  other  remains  of  former  civilized  occupancy  have
recently  been  discovered  (11).  In  this  year.  also.  ( 'ornelius  Dougherty',
an  Irishman  from  Virginia,  established  himself  as  the  first  trader
among  the  Cherokee,  with  whom  he  spent  the  rest  of  his  life.'  Some
of  his  descendants  still  occupy  honored  positions  in  the  tribe.
Among  the  manuscript  archives  of  South  Carolina  there  was  said  to
be, some  fifty  years  ago, a  treaty  or  agreement  made  with  the  govern-
ment of  that  colony  by  the  Cherokee  in  L684,  and  signed  with  the
hieroglyphics  of  eight  chiefs  of  the  lower  towns,  viz.  Corani.  the
Raven  (Ka'lanii):  Sinnawa,  the  Hawk  (Tla'nuwa);  Nellawgitehi,  Gor-
haleke.  and  Owasta,  all  of  Toxawa;  and  Canacaught,  the  great  Con-
juror, Gohoma,  and  Caunasaita,  of  Keowa.  If  still  in  existence,  this
is  probably  the  oldest  Cherokee  treaty  on  record.'' What  seems  to  be  the  next  mention  of  the  Cherokee  in  the  South
Carolina  records  occurs  in  L691,  when  we  find  an  inquiry  ordered  in
regard  to  a  report  that  some  of  the  colonists  "have,  without  any  proc-
lamation of  war.  fallen  upon  and  murdered"  several  of  that  tribe.6
In  1693  some  Cherokee  chiefs  went  to  Charleston  with  presents  for
the  governor  and  offers  of  friendship,  to  ask  the  protection  of  South
Carolina  against  their  enemies,  the  Esaw  (Catawba).  Savanna  (Shawano).

and  Congaree,  all  of  thai  colony,  who  bad  made  war  upon  them  and
sold  a  number  of  their  tribesmen  into  slavery.  They  were  told  that
their  kinsmen  could  not  n<>\\  be  recovered,  bul  that  the  English  desired
friendship  with  their  tribe,  and  thai  the  Government  would  see  that
there  would  be  no  future  ground  for  such  complaint.'  The  promise
was  apparently  not  kept,  for  in  L705  we  find  a  bitter  accusation  brought
against  Governor  Moore,  of  South  Carolina,  that  he  had  granted  com-
missions to  a  number  of  persons  "to  set  upon,  assault,  kill,  destroy,
ami  take  captive  as  many  Indians  as  they  possible  [sic]  could.'*  the prisoners  being  sold  into  slavery  for  his  and  their  private  profit.  By
this  course,  it  was  asserted,  he  had  •"already  almost  utterly  ruined  the
trade  for  skins  and  furs,  whereby  we  held  our  chief  correspondence
with  England,  and  turned  it  into  a  trade  of  Indians  or  slave  making,
whereby  the  Indians  to  the  south  and  west  of  us  are  alreadj  involved
in  blood  and  confusion.'"  The  arraignment  concludes  with  a  warning
that  such  conditions  would  in  all  probability  draw  down  upon  the  colony
an  Indian  war  with  all  its  dreadful  consequences.2  In  view  of  what
happened  a  few  years  later  this  reads  like  a  prophecy.
Aliout  tin' year  L700the  first  guns  were  introduced  among  the  Cher-
okee. th<'  event  being  fixed  traditionally  as  having  occurred  in  the  girl-
hood of  an  old  woman  of  the  tribe  who  died  aliout  L775.s  In  17ns  we
rind  them  described  as  a  numerous  people,  living  in  the  mountains
northwest  from  the  Charleston  settlements  and  havingsixty  towns,  hut
of  small  importance  in  the  Indian  trade,  being  "but  ordinary  hunters
and  less  warriors."*
In  the  war  with  the  Tuscarora  in  1711-171:'..  which  resulted  in  the
expulsion  of  that  tribe  from  North  Carolina,  more  than  a  thousand
southern  Indians  reenforced  the  South  Carolina  volunteers,  among
them  being  over  two  hundred  Cherokee,  hereditary  enemies  of  the
Tuscarora.  Although  these  Indian  allies  did  their  work  well  in  the
actual  encounters,  their  assistance  was  of  doubtful  advantage,  as  they
helped  themselves  freely  to  whatever  they  wanted  alone'  the  way.  so that  the  settlers  had  reason  to  fear  them  almost  as  much  as  the  hostile
Tuscarora.  After  torturing  a  large  number  of  their  prisoners  in  the
usual  savage  fashion,  they  returned  with  the  remainder,  whom  they
afterward  sold  as  slaves  to  South  Carolina.'
Having  wiped  out  old  scores  with  the  Tuscarora.  the  late  allies  of
the  English  proceeded  to  discuss  their  own  grievances,  which,  as  we
have  seen,  were  sufficiently  galling.     The  result  was  a  combination

against  the  whites,  embracing  all  the  tribes  from  Cape  Fear  to  the
Chattahoochee,  including  the  Cherokee,  who  thus  for  the  first  time
raised  their  hand  against  the  English.  The  war  opened  with  a  terrible
massacre  by  the  Yamassee  in  April,  1715,  followed  by  assaults  along
the  whole  frontier,  until  for  a  time  it  was  seriously  feared  that  the
colony  of  South  Carolina  would  lie  wiped  out  of  existence.  In  a
contest  between  savagery  and  civilization,  however,  the  final  result  is
inevitable.  The  settlers  at  last  rallied  their  whole  force  under  Gov-
ernor Craven  and  administered  such  a  crushing  blow  to  the  Yamassee
that  the  remnant  abandoned  their  country  and  took  refuge  with  the
Spaniards  in  Florida  or  among  the  Lower  Creeks.  The  English  then
made  short  work  with  the  smaller  tribes  along  the  coast,  while  those
in  the  interior  were  soon  glad  to  sue  for  peace.1
A  number  of  Cherokee  chiefs  having  come  down  to  Charleston  in
company  with  a  trader  to  express  their  desire  for  peace,  a  force  of
several  hundred  white  troops  and  a  number  of  negroes  under  Colonel
Maurice  Moore  went  up  the  Savannah  in  the  winter  of  1715-16  and
made  headquarters  among  the  Lower  Cherokee,  where  they  were
met  by  the  chiefs  of  the  Lower  and  some  of  the  western  towns,
who  reaffirmed  their  desire  for  a  lasting  peace  with  the  English,  but
refused  to  fight  against  the  Yamassee,  although  willing  to  proceed
against  some  other  tribes.  They  laid  the  blame  for  most  of  the
trouble  upon  the  traders,  who  "had  been  very  abuseful  to  them  of  late."
A  detachment  under  Colonel  George  Chicken,  sent  to  the  Upper
Cherokee,  penetrated  to  "  Quoneashee "  (Tlanusi'yi.  on  Hiwassee, about  the  present.  Murphy)  where  they  found  the  chiefs  more  defiant,
resolved  to  continue  the  war  against  the  ('reeks,  with  whom  the  Eng-
lish were  then  trying  to  make  peace,  and  demanding  large  supplies  of
guns  and  ammunition,  saying  that  if  they  made  a  peace  with  the  other
tribes  they  would  have  no  means  of  getting  slaves  with  which  to  buy
ammunition  for  themselves.  At  this  time  they  claimed  2,370  war-
riors, of  whom  half  were  believed  to  have  guns.  As  the  strength  of
the  whole  Nation  was  much  greater,  this  estimate  may  have  been  for
the  Upper  and  Middle  Cherokee  only.  After  "abundance  of  per-
suading" by  tin-  officers,  they  finally  '"told  us  they  would  trust  us
once  again,"  and  an  arrangement  was  made  to  furnish  them  two  hun-
dred guns  with  a  supply  of  ammunition,  together  with  fifty  white
soldiers,  to  assist  them  against  the  tribes  with  which  the  English  were,
still  at  war.  In  March,  171(5.  this  force  was  increased  by  one  hundred
men.  The  detachment  under  Colonel  Chicken  returned  by  way  of  the
towns  on  the  upper  part  of  the  Little  Tennessee,  thus  penetrating  the
heart  of  the  Cherokee  country. '

of  South  Carolina  invited  the  chiefs  of  the  Cherokee  t"  a  conference,
al  which  thirty-seven  towns  were  represented.  A  treat}  was  made
|p\  which  trading  methods  were  regulated,  a  boundary  line  between
their  territory  and  the  English  settlements  was  agreed  upon,  and  an
agent  was  appointed  to  superintend  their  affairs-.  At  the  governor's
suggestion,  one  chief,  called  WrosetasatoM  i  W  was  formally  commis-
sioned as  supreme  head  of  the  Nation,  with  authority  to  punish  all
offenses,  including  murder,  and  to  represent  all  Cherokee  claim-  to
the  colonial  government.  Thus  were  the  ( Jherokee  reduced  from  their
former  condition  of  a  free  people,  ranging  where  their  pleasure  led.  to
that  of  dependent  vassals  with  hounds  fixed  by  a  colonial  governor.
The  negotiations  were  accompanied  l>y  a  cession  of  land,  the  tirst  in
the  bistorj  of  the  tribe.  In  little  more  than  a  century  thereafter  they
had  signed  away  their  whole  original  territory.3
The  document  of  1 71  ti  already  quoted  puts  the  strength  of  the  ( Jhero-
kee at  that  time  at  2,370  warriors,  hut  in  this  estimate  the  Lower
Cherokee  seem  not  to  have  been  included.  In  171-"'.  according  to  a trade  census  compiled  by  Governor  Johnson  of  South  Carolina,  the
tribe  bad  thirty  towns,  with  4,000  warriors  and  a  total  population  of
ll.i'lo.'  Another  census  in  L721  gives  them  fifty-three  towns  with
3,510  warriors  and  a  total  of  L0,379,6  while  the  report  of  the  hoard  of
trade  for  the  same  year  e-ives  them  3,800  warriors,6  equivalent,  by  the
same  proportion,  to  nearly  L2,000  total.  Adair,  a  good  authority  on
such  matters,  estimates,  about  the  year  L735,  when  the  country  was
better  known,  that  they  had  "sixty-four  towns  and  villages,  populous
and  full  of  children,"  with  more  than  6,000  fighting  men.  equivalent
<>n  the  same  basis  of  computation  to  between  1.6,000  and  L7,000  souls.
From  what  we  know  of  them  in  later  times,  it  is  probable  that  this
last  estimate  is  very  nearly  correct.
I>\  this  time  the  colonial  government  had  become  alarmed  at  the
advance  of  the  French,  who  had  made  their  first  'permanent  establish-
ment in  the  Gulf  states  at  Biloxi  hay.  Mississippi,  in  L699,  and  in
1711    had    built    Fort   Toulouse,  known   to  the   English  as  "the  fort   at

the  Alabamas,"  on  Coosa  river,  a  few  miles  above  the  present  Mont-
gomery, Alabama.  From  this  central  vantage  point  they  had  rapidly
extended  their  influence  among  all  the  neighboring  tribes  until  in
1721  it  was  estimated  that  3,400  warriors  who  had  formerly  traded
with  Carolina  had  been  ••entirely  debauched  to  the  French  interest,"
while  2,000  more  were  wavering,  and  only  the  Cherokee  could  still  be
considered  friendly  to  the  English.1  From  this  time  until  the  final
withdrawal  of  the  French  in  IT*'.:;  the  explanation  of  our  Indian  wars
is  to  be  found  in  the  struggle  between  the  two  nations  for  territorial
and  commercial  supremacy,  the  Indian  being  simply  the  cat's-paw  of one  o]-  the  other.  For  reasons  of  their  own.  the  Chickasaw,  whose
territory  lay  within  the  recognized  limits  of  Louisiana,  soon  became  the
uncompromising  enemies  of  the  French,  and  as  their  position  enabled
them  in  a  measure  to  control  the  approach  from  the  Mississippi,  the
Carolina  government  saw  to  it  that  they  were  kept  well  supplied  with
guns  and  ammunition.  British  traders  were  in  all  their  towns,  and
on  one  occasion  a  French  force,  advancing  against  a  Chickasaw
palisaded  village,  found  it  garrisoned  by  Englishmen  flying  the  British
flag.2  The  Cherokee,  although  nominally  allies  of  the  English,  were
strongly  disposed  to  favor  the  French,  and  it  required  every  effort  of
the  Carolina  government  to  hold  them  to  their  allegiance.
In  1730,  to  further  lix  the  Cherokee  in  the  English  interest,  Sir
Alexander  Cuming  was  dispatched  on  a  secret  mission  to  that  tribe,
which  was  again  smarting  under  grievances  and  almost  ready  to  join
witli  the  Creeks  in  an  alliance  with  the  French.  Proceeding  to  the
ancient  town  of  Nequassee  (Nikwasi',  at  the  present  Franklin,  North
Carolina),  lie  so  impressed  the  chiefs  by  his  bold  bearing  that  they
conceded  without  question  all  his  demands,  submitting  themselves
and  their  people  for  the  second  time  to  the  English  dominion  and
designating  Moytoy,3  of  Tellico,  to  act  as  their  "emperor"  and  to
represent  the  Nation  in  all  transactions  with  the  whites.  Seven  chiefs
were  selected  to  visit  England,  where,  in  the  palace  at  Whitehall,
they  solemnly  renewed  the  treaty,  acknowledging  the  sovereignty  of
England  and  binding  themselves  to  have  no  trade  or  alliance  with  any
other  nation,  not  to  allow  any  other  white  people  to  settle  among
thein.  and  to  deliver  up  any  fugitive  slaves  who  might  seek  refuge
with  them.  To  confirm  their  words  they  delivered  a  "crown",  five
eagle-tails,  and  four  scalps,  which  they  had  brought  with  them.  In
return  they  received  the  usual  glittering  promises  of  love  and  per-
petual friendship,  together  with  a  substantial  quantity  of  guns,  ammu-
nition, and   red   paint.     The  treaty  being  concluded  in    September,

they  took  ship  for  Carolina,  where  they  arrived,  as  we  are  told  by
(he  governor,  "in  good  health  and  mightily  well  satisfied  with  His
Majestj  '-  bounty  to  them."  ' In  the  next  year  some  action  was  taken  to  use  the  Cherokee  and
Catawba  to  subdue  the  refractory  remnant  of  the  Tuscarora  in  North
Carolina,  but  when  it  was  found  that  this  was  liable  t<>  bring  down  the
wrath  of  the  Iroquois  upon  the  Carolina  settlements,  more  peaceable
methods  were  used  instead. '
In  L738  or  17:;'.'  the  smallpox,  brought  to  Carolina  by  slave  ships,
broke  out  among  the  ( Iherokee  with  such  terrible  effect  that,  according
to  Adair,  nearly  half  the  tribe  was  swept  away  within  a  year.  The
awful  mortality  was  due  largely  to  the  fact  that  as  it  was  a  new  and
strange  disease  to  the  Indian-  they  had  no  proper  remedies  against  it.
and  therefore  resorted  to  the  universal  Indian  panacea  for  "strong"
sickness  of  almost  any  kind.  viz.  cold  plunge  baths  in  the  running
stream,  the  worst  treatment  that  could  possibly  !»•  devised.  A>  the
pestilence  spread  unchecked  from  town  to  town,  despair  fell  upon  the
nation.  The  priests,  believing  the  visitation  a  penalty  for  violation  of
the  ancient  ordinances,  threw  away  their  sacred  paraphernalia  as  things
which   had   lost   their  protecting   power.      Hundreds  of   the   warriors
committed  suicide  on  beholding  their  frightful  disfigurement.    "So
shot  themselves,  others  cut  their  throats,  some  stabbed  themselves
with  knives  and  others  with  sharp-pointed  canes:  many  threw  them-
sel\  es  with  sullen  madness  into  the  tire  and  there  slowly  expired,  a-  ii
they  hail  been  utterly  divested  of  the  native  power  of  feeling  pain."3
Another  authority  estimates  their  loss  at  a  thousand  warriors,  partly
from  smallpox  and  partly  from  rum  brought  in  by  the  traders.1
A 1  >■  nit  the  year  L 740  a  trading  path  for  horsemen  was  marked  out
by  the  Cherokee  from  the  new  settlement  of  Augusta,  in  Georgia,  to
their  towns  on  the  headwaters  of  Savannah  river  and  thence  on  to  the
west.  This  road,  which  went  up  the  south  side  of  the  river,  soon
became  much  frequented.*  Previous  to  this  time  most  of  the  trading
goods  had  been  transported  on  the  backs  of  Indians.  In  the  same
year  a  party  of  Cherokee  under  the  war  chief  Ka'lanu.  •"The  Raven,"
took  part  in  Oglethorpe's  expedition  against  the  Spaniards  of  Saint
Augustine.

mode  of  life,  had  quickly  acquired  a  Leading  influence  among  them.
He  drew  up  for  their  adoption  a  scheme  of  government  modeled  after
the  European  plan,  with  the  capital  at  Great  Tellico,  in  Tennessee,
the  principal  medicine  man  as  emperor,  and  himself  as  the  emperor's
secretary.  Dnder  this  title  he  corresponded  with  the  South  Carolina
government  until  it  began  to  be  feared  that  he  would  ultimately  win
over  the  whole  tribe  to  the  French  side.     A  commissi   r  was  sent  to
arrest  him,  but  the  Cherokee  refused  to  give  him  up.  and  the  deputy
was  obliged  to  return  under  safe-conduct  of  an  escort  furnished  by
Priber.  Five  years  after  the  inauguration  of  his  work,  however,  he
was  seized  by  some  English  traders  while  on  his  way  to  Fort  Toulouse,
and  brought  as  a  prisoner  to  Frederica,  in  Georgia,  where  he  soon
afterward  died  while  under  confinement.  Although  his  enemies  had
represented  him  as  a  monster,  inciting  the  Indians  to  the  grosses!
immoralities,  he  proved  to  be  a  gentleman  of  polished  address,  exten-
sive learning,  and  rare  courage,  as  was  shown  later  on  the  occasion  of
an  explosion  in  the  barracks  magazine.  Besides  Greek,  Latin.  French,
German,  Spanish,  and  fluent  English,  he  spoke  also  the  Cherokee,
and  among  his  papers  which  were  seized  was  found  a  manuscript
dictionary  of  the  language,  which  he  had  prepared  for  publication  -
the  first,  and  even  yet,  perhaps,  the  most  important  study  of  the  lan-
guage ever  made.  Says  Adair:  "As  he  was  learned  and  possessed
of  a  very  sagacious  penetrating  judgment,  and  had  every  qualification
that  was  requisite  for  his  bold  and  difficult  enterprise,  it  was  not  to  be
doubted  that,  as  he  wrote  a  Cheerake  dictionary,  designed  to  be
published  at  Paris,  he  likewise  set  down  a  great  deal  that  would  have
been  very  acceptable  to  the  curious  and  serviceable  to  the  representa-
tives of  South  Carolina  and  Georgia,  which  may  be  readily  found  in
Frederica  if  the  manuscripts  have  had  the  good  fortune  to  escape  the
despoiling  hands  of  military  power."  He  claimed  to  be  a  Jesuit,  acting
under. orders  of  his  superior,  to  introduce  habits  of  steady  industry,
civilized  arts,  and  a  regular  form  of  government  among  the  southern
tribes,  with  a  view  to  the  ultimate  founding  of  an  independent  Indian
state.  From  all  that  can  be  gathered  of  him.  even  though  it  comes
from  hi-  enemies,  there  can  be  little  doubt  that  he  was  a  worthy
member  of  that  illustrious  order  whose  name  has  been  a  >\  nonym  for
scholarship,  devotion,  and  courage  from  the  days  of  Jogues  and  Mar-
quette down  to  De  Smet  ami  Mengarini.1
I'p  to  this  time  no  civilizing  or  mission  work  had  been  undertaken by  either  of  the  Carolina  governments  among  any  of  the  tribes  within
their  borders.  As  one  writer  of  the  period  quaintly  puts  it.  "The
gospel  spirit  is  not  yet  so  gloriously  arisen  as  to  seek  them  more  than
theirs."  while  another  in  stronger  terms  affirms.  "To  the   shame  of

the  Christian  name,  no  pains  have  ever  been  taken  to  convert  them  to
Christianity;  on  the  contrary,  their  morals  are  perverted  and  cor
rupted  da  the  sad  example  they  daily  have  of  its  depraved  professors
residing  in  their  towns."'  Readers  of  Lawson  and  other  narratives
of  the  period  will  feel  the  force  of  the  rebuke.
Throughout  the  eighteenth  century  the  Cherokee  were  engaged  in
chronic  warfare  with  their  Indian  neighbors.  As  these  quarrels  con-
cerned thr  whites  but  little,  however  UK mieiiti hi-  they  may  have  been
to  the  principals,  we  have  but  few  details.  The  war  with  the  Tusca-
rora  continued  until  the  outbreak  of  the  latter  tribe  against  Carolina
in  171  1  gave  opportunity  to  the  Cherokee  to  cooperate  in  striking  the
blow  which  drove  the  Tuscarora  from  their  ancient  homes  to  seek
refuge  in  the  north.  The  Cherokee  then  turned  their  attention  to  the
Shawano  on  the  ( 'uniberland.  and  with  the  aid  of  the  ( 'hiekasaw  finally
expelled  theiu  from  that  region  about  the  year  L715.  Inroads  upon
the  Catawba  were  probably  kept  up  until  the  latter  had  become  so  far
reduced  by  war  and  disease  as  to  be  mere  dependent  pensioners  upon
the  whites.  The  former  friendship  with  the  Chickasaw  was  at  last
broken  through  the  overbearing  conduct  of  the  Cherokee,  and  a  war
followed  of  which  we  find  incidental  notice  in  L757,8  and  which  termi-
nated in  a  decisive  victory  for  the  Chickasaw  about  L768.  The  bitter
war  with  the  Iroquois  of  the  far  north  continued,  in  spite  of  all  the
efforts  of  the  colonial  governments,  until  a  formal  treaty  of  peace  was
brought  about  by  the  efforts  of  Sir  William  Johnson  (12)  in  the  same
year.
The  hereditary  war  with  the  Creeks  for  possession  id'  upper  Georgia continued,  with  brief  intervals  of  peace,  or  even  alliance,  until  the
United  States  finally  interfered  as  mediator  between  the  rival  claimants.
In  L718  we  find  notice  of  a  large  Cherokee  war  party  moving  against
the  Creek  tow  n  of  i  loweta,  on  the  lower  ( lhattahoocbee,  but  dispersing
on  learning  of  the  presence  there  of  some  French  and  Spanish  officers,
a-  well  a-  some  English  traders,  all  bent  on  arranging  an  alliance  with
the  Creeks.  The  Creeks  themselves  had  declared  their  willingness  to
be  :it  peace  with  the  English,  while  still  determined  to  keep  the  bloody
hatchet  uplifted  against  the  Cherokee.3      The  most  important  incident
of    the    Struggle    between    the    two    tribes    was    probably    the    battle    of
Tali'wa  about  the  year  1755. '
By  this  time  the  weaker  coast  tribes  had  become  practically  extinct.
and  the  more  powerful  tribes  of  the  interior  were  beginning  to  take
the  alarm,  as  they  saw  the  restless  borderers  pushing  every  \  ear  farther
into  the  Indian  country.  As  early  as  174S  Dr  Thomas  Walker,  with  a
company  of  hunters  and  woodsmen  from  Virginia,  crossed  the  moun-

tains  to  the  southwest,  discovering  and  naming  the  celebrated  Cumber-
land gap  and  passing  on  to  the  headwaters  of  Cumberland  river.
Two  years  later  he  made  a  second  exploration  and  penetrated  to  Ken-
tucky  river,  but  on   account  of  the    Indian   troubles   no  permanent
settlement  was  then  attempted."  This  invasion  of  their  territory
awakened  a  natural  resentment  of  the  native  owners,  and  we  rind
proof  also  in  the  Virginia  records  that  the  irresponsible  borderers
seldom  let  pass  an  opportunity  to  kill  and  plunder  any  stray  Indian
found  in  their  neighborhood.
In  1755  the  Cherokee  were  officially  reported  to  number  2,590  war-
riors, as  against  probably  twice  that  number  previous  to  the  great
smallpox  epidemic  sixteen  years  before.  Their  neighbors  and  ancient
enemies,  the  Catawba,  had  dwindled  to  240  men.2
Although  war  was  not  formally  declared  by  England  until  L756,
hostilities  in  tiie  seven  year's  struggle  between  France  and  England,
commonly  known  in  America  as  the  "  French  and  Indian  war."  began in  April,  1754.  when  the  French  seized  a  small  postwhich  the  English
had  begun  at  tile  present  site  of  Pittsburg,  and  which  was  afterward
finished  by  the  French  under  the  name  of  Fort  Du  Quesne.  Strenuous
efforts  were  made  by  the  English  to  secure  the  Cherokee  to  their
interest  against  the  French  and  their  Indian  allies,  and  treaties  were
negotiated  by  which  they  promised  assistance.3  As  these  treaties.
however,  carried  the  usual  cessions  of  territory,  and  stipulated  for
the  building  of  several  forts  in  the  heart  of  the  Cherokee  country,  it
is  to  be  feared  that  the  Indians  were  not  duly  impressed  by  tin  disin-
terested character  of  the  proceeding.  Their  preference  for  the  French
was  but  thinly  veiled,  and  only  immediate  policy  prevented  them  from
throwing  their  whole  force  into  the  scale  on  that  side.  The  reasons
for  this  preference  are  given  by  Timberlake,  the  young  Virginian
officer  who  visited  the  tribe  on  an  embassy  of  conciliation  a  few  years
later:
I  found  the  nation  much  attached  to  the  French,  who  have  the  prudence,  by
familiar  politeness — which  costs  hut  little  ami  often  does  a  great  deal — ami  conform-
ing themselves  to  their  ways  and  temper,  to  conciliate  the  inclinations  of  almost  all
the  Indians  they  are  acquainted  with,  while  the  pride  of  our  officers  often  disgusts
them.  Nay,  they  did  net  scruple  to  own  to  me  that  it  was  the  trade  alone  that
induced  them  to  make  peace  with  us,  ami  net  any  preference  to  the  French,  whom
they  loved  a  great  deal  better.  .  .  .  The  English  are  now  so  nigh,  and  encroached
daily  so  far  upon  them,  that  they  u^t  only  felt  the  had  effects  of  it  ill  their  hunting
grounds,  which  were  spoiled,  hut  had  all  the  reason  in  the  world  to  apprehend  being
swallowed  up  by  so  potent  neighbors  or  driven  from  the  country  inhabited  by  their
fathers,  in  which  they  were  horn  ami  brought  up,  in  tine,  their  native  soil,  for  which
all  men  have  a  particular  tenderness  and  affection.

their  promise,  as  their  great  council  at  Echota  ordered  the  work
stopped  and  the  garrison  on  the  wax  to  turn  hack,  plainly  telling  the
officer  in  charge  that  they  did  not  want  so  many  white  people  among
them.  Ata-kullakulla,  hitherto  supposed  to  he  one  of  the  stanchest
friendsof  the  English,  was  now  one  of  the  most  determined  in  the  oppo-
sition. It  was  in  evidence  also  that  they  were  in  constant  communi-
cation with  the  French.  By  much  tact  and  argument  their  objec-
tions were  at  last  overcome  for  a  time,  and  they  very  unwillingly  set
about  raising  the  promised  force  of  warriors.  Major  Andrew  Lewi-,
who  superintended  the  building  of  the  fort,  became  convinced  that
the  Cherokee  were  really  friendly  to  the  French,  and  that  all  their
professions  of  friendship  and  assistance  were  ■•only  to  put  a  gloss  on
their  knavery."  The  fort  was  finally  completed,  and.  on  his  suggestion,
wag  garrisoned  with  a  strong  force  of  two  hundred  men  under  Captain
Demere\5  'There  was  strong  ground  for  believing  that  some  depreda- tions committed  about  this  time  on  the  heads  of  Catawba  and  Broad
rivers,  in  North  ( 'arolina.  were  the  joint  work  id'  ( 'herokee  and  northern
Indians."  Notwithstanding  all  this,  a  considerable  body  of  Cherokee
joined  the  British  forces  on  the  Virginia  frontier.
Fort  I  >u  Quesne  was  taken  by  the  American  provincials  under  Wash-

Indians  themselves  were  not  ready  to  accept  the  settlement.  In  the
north  the  confederated  tribes  under  Pontiac  continued  to  war  on  their
own  account  until  17<'>5.  In  the  South  the  very  Cherokee  who  had
acted  a^  allies  of  the  British  against  Fort  DuQuesne,  and  had  volun-
tarily offered  to  guard  the  frontier  south  of  the  Potomac,  returned
to  rouse  their  tribe  to  resistance.
The  immediate  exciting  cause  of  the  trouble  was  an  unfortunate  expe-
dition undertaken  against  the  hostile  Shawano  in  February,  L756,  by
Major  Andrew  Lewi--  (the  same  who  had  built  Fort  Loudon)  withsome
two  hundred  Virginia  troops  assisted  by  about  one  hundred  Cherokee.
After  -i\  weeks  of  fruitless  tramping  through  tin'  woods,  with  the
ground  covered  with  snow  and  the  streams  s,,  swollen  by  rains  that
they  lost  their  provisions  and  ammunition  in  crossing,  they  were  obliged
to  return  to  the  settlements  in  a  starving  condition,  having  killed  their
horses  on  the  way.  The  Indian  contingent  had  from  the  first  been
disgusted  at  the  contempt  and  neglect  experienced  from  those  whom
they  had  conn1  to  assist.  The  Tuscarora  and  others  had  already  gone
home,  and  the  Cherokee  now  started  to  return  on  foot  to  their  own
country.  Finding  some  horses  running  loose  on  the  range,  they
appropriated  them,  on  the  theory  that  as  they  had  lost  their  own
animals,  to  say  nothing  of  having  risked  their  lives,  in  the  service
of  the  colonists,  it  was  only  a  fair  exchange.  The  frontiersmen
took  another  view  of  the  question  however,  attacked  the  returning
Cherokee,  and  killed  a  number  of  them,  variously  stated  at  from
twelve  to  forty,  including  several  of  their  prominent  men.  Accord-
ing to  Adair  they  also  scalped  and  mutilated  the  bodies  in  the  savage
fashion  to  which  they  had  become  accustomed  in  the  border  wars,  and
bi'ought  the  scalps  into  the  settlements,  where  they  were  represented
as  those  of  French  Indians  and  sold  at  the  regular  price  then  estab-
lished by  law.  The  young  warriors  at  once  prepared  to  take  revenge,
but  were  restrained  by  the  chief s  until  satisfaction  could  be  demanded
in  the  ordinary  way.  according  to  the  treaties  arranged  with  the  colonial
governments.  Application  was  made  in  turn  to  Virginia,  North
Carolina,  and  South  Carolina,  but  without  success.  While  the  women
were  still  wailing  night  and  morning  for  their  slain  kindred,  and  the
Creeks  were  taunting  the  warriors  for  their  cowardice  in  thus  quietly
submitting  to  the  injury,  some  lawless  officers  of  Fort  Prince  George
committed  an  unpardonable  outrage  at  the  neighboring  Indian  town
{_^^while  most  of  the  men  were  away  hunting.1  The  warriors  could  no
longer  be  restrained.  Soon  there  was  news  of  attacks  upon  the  back
settlements  of  Carolina,  while  on  the  other  side  of  the  mountains  two
soldiers  of  the  Fort  Loudon  garrison  were  killed.  War  seemed  at
hand.

42  MYTHS    OB     llli     l  HEROKEE
At  ihi-  juncture,  in  November,  1758,  a  party  of  influential  chiefs,
having  first  ordered  back  a  war  party  ju-t  aboul  in  set  mil  from  the
western  towns  against  the  Carolina  settlements,  came  down  toChai-les-
ton  and  succeeded  in  arranging  the  difficulty  upon  a  friendly  basis.
The  assembly  had  officially  declared  peace  with  (lie  <  !herokee,  \\  hen,  in
M;i\  of  1759,  Governor  Lyttleton  unexpectedly  came  forward  with  a
demand  for  the  surrender  I'm-  execution  of  every  Indian  who  had  killed
a  white  man  in  tin'  recent  skirmishes,  among  these  being  t } » « -  chiefs  of
Citieo  and  Tellico.  At  the  same  time  the  commanderal  Fori  Loudon,
forgetful  of  the  fact  that  In'  had  but  a  -mall  garrison  in  the  midst  of
several  thousands  of  restless  savages,  made  a  demand  for  twentj  four
other  chiefs  whom  he  suspected  of  unfriendly  action.  Tocompel  their
surrender  orders  were  given  to  stop  all  trading  supplies  intended  for
i  he  upper  ( Iherokee.
This  roused  tin'  whole  Nation,  and  a  delegation  representing  everj
town  came  down  to  Charleston,  protesting  the  de-ire  of  the  Indian-  lor
peace  and  friendship,  but  declaring  their  inability  to  surrender  their  own
chiefs.  The  governor  replied  by  declaring  war  in  November,  1759, at
once  callingout  troops  and  sending  messengers  to  secure  the  aid  of  all
the  surrounding  tribes  against  the  Cherokee,  [n  the  meantime  asecond
delegation  of  thirty -two  of  the  most  prominent  men.  led  by  the  young
war  chief  Oconostota  (Agan-st&ta),1  arrived  t<>  make  a  further  efforl
for  peace,  Imt  the  governor,  refusing  to  listen  to  them,  seized  the
whole  party  and  confined  them  as  prisoners  at  Fort  Prince  George,  in
a  room  large  enough  for  only  six  soldiers,  while  at  the  same  time  he
set  fourteen  hundred  troops  in  motion  to  invade  the  Cherokee  country.
On  further  representation  by  Ata-kullakulla (Ata'-gul''kfilu'),  the  civil chief  of  the  Nation  and  well  known  as  a  friend  of  the  English,  the  gov-
ernor released  Oconostota  and  two  others  after  compelling  some  half
do/en  of  the  delegation  to  sign  a  paper  by  which  they  pretended  to
agree  lor  their  tribe  to  kill  or  seize  any  Frenchmen  entering  their
countrj  .  and  consented  to  the  imprisonment  of  the  parly  until  all  the
warriors  demanded  had  been  surrendered  for  execution  <>r  otherwise.
At  this  stage  of  affairs  the  smallpox  broke  out  in  the  Cherokee  towns.
rendering  a  further  stay  in  their  neighborhood  unsafe,  and  thinking
the  whole  matter  now  settled  on  his  own  basis,  Lyttleton  returned
to  ( 'harleston.
The  event  soon  proved  how  little  he  knew  of  Indian  temper,  <  Ocono-
stota at  once  laid  siege  to  Fort  1'rince  George,  completely  cutting  off
communication  at  a  time  when,  as  it  was  now  winter,  no  help  could
well  be  expected  from  below.  In  February,  L 760,  after  having  kept
the  fort  thus  closely  invested  for  some  weeks,  he  sent  word  one  day
by  an  Indian  woman  that  he  \\  ished  to  speak  to  the  commander,  Lieut-
enant Coytmore.     As  the  lieutenant  stepped  out   from  the  stockade
1  Fur  notices  Bee  I  he  fi :


i  Montgomery's  expedition — 1760  43
to  see  what  was  wanted,  Oconostota,  standing  on  the  opposite  side  of
the  river,  swung  a  bridle  above  his  head  as  a  signal  to  his  warriors
concealed  in  the  bushes,  and  the  officer  was  at  once  shot  down.  The
soldiers  immediately  broke  into  the  room  where  the  hostages  were
confined,  every  cue  being  a  chief  of  prominence  in  the  tribe,  and
butchered  them  to  the  last  man.
It  was  now  war  to  the  end.  Led  by  Oconostota,  the  Cherokee
descended  upon  the  frontier  settlements  of  ( iarolina,  while  the  warriors
across  the  mountains  laid  close  siege  to  Fort  London.  In  June,  L760,
a  strong  force  of  over  L,600  men.  under  Colonel  Montgomery,  started
to  reduce  the  Cherokee  towns  and  relieve  the  beleaguered  garrison.
Crossing  the  Indian  frontier.  Montgomery  quickly  drove  the  enemy
from  about  Fort  Prince  George  and  then,  rapidly  advancing,  surprised
Little  Keow'ee,  killing  every  man  of  the  defenders,  and  destroyed  in
succession  every  one  of  the  Lower  Cherokee  towns,  burning  them  to
the  ground,  cutting  down  the  cornfields  and  orchards,  killing  and
taking  more  than  a  hundred  of  their  men.  and  driving  the  whole  popu-
lation into  the  mountains  before  him.  His  own  loss  was  very  slight.
He  then  sent  messengers  to  the  .Middle  and  Upper  towns,  summoning
them  to  surrender  on  penalty  of  the  like  fate,  but,  receiving  no  reply,
he  led  his  men  across  the  divide  to  the  waters  of  the  Little  Tennessee
and  continued  down  that  stream  without  opposition  until  he  came  in
the  vicinity  of  Ephoee  (Itse'yi),  a  few  mile-  above  the  sacred  town  of
Nikwasi',  the  present  Franklin.  North  Carolina.  Here  the  Cherokee
had  collected  their  full  force  to  resist  his  progress,  and  the  result  was
a  desperate  engagement  on  dune  27,  LTtio.  by  which  Montgomery  was
compelled  to  retire  to  Fort  Prince  George,  after  losing  nearly  one
hundred  men  in  killed  and  wounded.     The  Indian  loss  is  unknown.
His  retreat  sealed  the  fate  of  Fort  Loudon.  The  garrison,  though
hard  pressed  and  reduced  to  the  necessity  of  eating  horses  and  dogs,
had  been  enabled  to  hold  out  through  the  kindness  of  the  Indian
women,  many  of  whom,  having  found  sweethearts  among  the  soldiers,
brought  them  supplies  of  f   1  daily.     When  threatened  by  the  chiefs
the  women  boldly  replied  that  the  soldiers  were  their  husbands  and  it
was  their  duty  to  help  them,  and  that  if  any  harm  came  to  themselves
for  their  devotion  their  English  relatives  would  avenge  them.1  The
end  was  only  delayed,  however,  and  on  August  8,  1760,  the  garrison
of  about  two  hundred  men,  under  Captain  Demere,  surrendered  to
Oconostota  on  promise  that  they  should  be  allowed  to  retire  unmo-
lested with  their  arms  and  sufficient  ammunition  for  the  march,  on
condition  of  delivering  up  all  the  remaining  warlike  stores.
The  troops  marched  out  and  proceeded  far  enough  to  camp  for  the
night,  while  the  Indians  swarmed  into  the  fort  to  see  what  plunder
they  might  hud.      "By  accident  a  discovery  was  made  of  ten  bags  of

powder  and  a  large  quantity  of  ball  thai  had  been  secretly  buried  in
the  fort,  to  prevent  their  falling  into  the  enemy's  hands"  (Hewat).
It  i-  said  also  that  cannon,  small  arm-,  and  ammunition  had  been
thrown  into  the  river  with  the  same  intention  (Haywood).  Em-aged
al  this  breach  of  the  capitulation  the  Cherokee  attacked  the  soldiers
next  morning  at  daylight,  killing  Deniere"  and  twenty-nine  others  at the  first  fire.  The  rest  were  taken  ami  held  as  pris   »rs  until  ran-
somed some  time  after.  The  second  officer,  Captain  Stuart  (13),  for
whom  the  Indian-  had  a  high  regard,  was  claimed  by  Ata-kullakulla.
who  soon  after  took  him  into  the  woods,  ostensibly  on  a  hunting
excursion,  and  conducted  him  for  nine  days  through  the  wilderness
until  he  delivered  him  safely  into  the  hands  of  friends  in  Virginia.
The  chief's  kindness  was  well  rewarded,  and  it  was  largely  through
his  influence  that  peace  was  finally  brought  about.
It  was  now  too  late,  and  the  settlements  were  too  much  exhausted,
for  another  expedition,  so  the  fall  and  winter  were  employed  by  the
English  in  preparations  for  an  active  campaign  the  next  year  in  force
to  crush  out  all  resistance.  In  June  1761,  Colonel  Grant  with  an
army  of  2,600  men.  including  a  number  of  Chickasaw  and  almost
every  remaining  warrior  of  the  Catawba,1  set  out  from  Fort  Prince
George.  Refusings  request  from  Ata-kullakulla  foi  a  friendly  accom-
modation, he  crossed  Rabun  yap  and  advanced  rapidly  down  the
Little  Tennessee  alone-  the  same  trail  taken  by  the  expedition  of  the
previous  year.  On  June  10,  when  within  two  miles  of  Montgomery's
battlefield,  he  encountered  the  Cherokee,  whom  he  defeated,  although
with  considerable  loss  to  himself,  after  a  stubborn  engagement  lasting
several  hours.  Having  repulsed  the  Indians,  he  proceeded  on  his
way,  sending  out  detachments  to  the  outlying  settlements,  until  in
the  course  of  a  month  he  had  destroyed  every  one  of  the  Middle
town-.  I.',  in  all.  with  all  their  granaries  and  cornfields,  driven  the
inhabitants  into  the  mountain-,  and  "pushed  the  frontier  seventy
miles  farther  to  the  west."
y1^  The  Cherokee  were  now    reduced  to  the  greatest   extremity.      With some  of  their  best  towns  in  ashes,  their  fields  and  orchards  wasted  for
two  successive  years,  their  ammunition  nearly  exhausted,  many  of
their  bravest  warriors  dead,  their  people  fugitives  in  the  mountains,
hiding  in  caves  and  living  like  beasts  upon  roots  or  killing  their
horses  for  food,  with  the  terrible  scourge  of  smallpox  adding  to  the
mi-eric-  of  starvation,  and  withal  torn  by  factional  differences  which
had  existed  from  the  very  beginning  of  the  war  ii  wa-  impossible
for  even  brave  men  to  resist  longer.  In  September  Ata-kullakulla,
who  had  all  alone-  done  everything  in  his  power  to  stay  the  disaffec-
tion, came  down   to  Charleston,  a  treaty  of  peace  was  made,  and  the

war  was  ended.  From  an  estimated  population  of  at  least  5,000  war-
riors some  years  before,  the  Cherokee  had  now  been  reduced  to  about
2,300  men.1 In  the  meantime  a  force  of  Virginians  under  Colonel  Stephen  had
advanced  as  far  as  the  Great  island  of  the  Holston  -now  Klingsport,
Tennessee — where  they  were  met  by  a  large  delegation  of  Cherokee,
who  sued  for  peace,  which  was  concluded  with  them  by  Colonel
Stephen  on  November  19,  1761,  independently  of  what  was  being  done
in  South  Carolina.  On  the  urgent  request  of  the  chief  that  an  officer
might  visit  their  people  for  a  short  time  to  cement  the  new  friendship,
Lieutenant  Henry  Timberlake,  a  young  Virginian  who  had  already  dis-
tinguished himself  in  active  service,  volunteered  to  return  with  them  to
their  towns,  where  he  spent  several  months.  He  afterward  conducted
a  delegation  of  chiefs  to  England,  where,  as  they  had  come  without
authority  from  the  Government,  they  met  such  an  unpleasant  recep-
tion that  they  returned  disgusted.  '
On  the  conclusion  of  peace  between  England  and  France  in  1  T •  *► : ; .  by which  the  whole  western  territory  was  ceded  to  England,  a  great
council  was  held  at  Augusta,  which  was  attended  by  the  chiefs  and
principal  men  of  all  the  southern  Indians,  at  which  Captain  John
Stuart,  superintendent  for  the  southern  tribes,  together  with  the  colo-
nial governors  of  Virginia,  North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,  and  ( reor
gia,  explained  fully  to  the  Indians  the  new  condition  of  affairs,  and  a
treaty  of  mutual  peace  and  friendship  was  concluded  on  November  10
of  that  year.  : Under  several  leaders,  as  Walker,  W alien,  Smith,  and  Boon,  the  tide
of  emigration  now  surged  across  the  mountains  in  spite  of  every  efforl
to  restrain  it.4  and  the  period  between  the  end  of  the  Cherokee  war
and  the  opening  of  the  Revolution  is  principally  notable  for  a  number
of  treaty  cessions  by  the  Indians,  each  in  fruitless  endeavor  to  tix  a
permanent  barrier  between  themselves  and  the  advancing  wave  of
white  settlement.  Chief  among  these  was  the  famous  Henderson  pur-
\/  chase  in  1775,  which  included  the  whole  tract  between  the  Kentucky
and  Cumberland  rivers,  embracing  the  greater  part  of  the  present
state  of  Kentucky.  By  these  treaties  the  Cherokee  were  shorn  of
practically  all  their  ancient  territorial  claims  north  of  the  present
Tennessee  line  and  east  of  the  Blue  ridge  and  the  Savannah,  including
much  of  their  best  hunting  range;  their  home  settlements  were,  how-
ever, left  still  in  their  possession. '

46  MYTHS    OK    THE    CHEROKEI  [bih.ann.19
As   ■  consequence  of  the  late  Cherokee  war,  a  royal  proclamation
had  been  issued  in  L 763,  with  a  view  of  checking  future  encroachments
l>\  the  whites,  which  prohibited  any  private  land  purchases  from  the
Indians,  or  an}  granting  of  warrants  for  lands  wesl  of  the  sources
of  the  streams  flowing  into  the  Atlantic.1  In  L 768,  on  the  appeal  of
the  Indians  themselves,  the  British  superintendent  for  the  southern
tribes,  Captain  John  Stuart,  had  negotiated  a  treaty  at  Hani  Labor
in  South  Carolina  by  which  Kanawha  and  New  rivers,  along  their
whole  course  downward  from  the  North  Carolina  line,  were  Sxed  as
the  boundary  between  the  Cherokee  and  the  whites  in  that  direction.
In  two  years,  however,  so  many  borderers  had  crossed  into  the  Indian
country,  where  thej  were  evidently  determined  to  remain,  thai  it  was
found  necessary  to  substitute  another  treaty,  by  which  the  line  was
made  to  nm  due  south  from  t  he  mouth  of  the  Kanawha  to  the  Hols  ton,
thus  cutting  off  from  the  Cherokee  almost  the  whole  of  their  hunting
grounds  in  Virginia  and  West  Virginia.  Two  years  later,  in  I77l'.
the  Virginians  demanded  a  further  cession,  by  which  everything  east
of  Kentucky  river  was  surrendered;  and  finally,  on  March  17.  177.">.
the  great  Henderson  purchase  was  consummated,  including  the  whole
tract  between  the  Kentucky  and  Cumberland  rivers.  By  this  last  i/
cession  the  Cherokee  were  at  last  cut  otl'  from  Ohio  river  and  all  their
rich  Kentucky  hunting  grounds.8
While  these  transactions  were  called  treaties,  they  were  really
forced  upon  the  native  proprietors,  who  resisted  each  in  turn  and
finally  signed  only  under  protest  and  on  most  solemn  assurances  that
no  further  demands  would  be  made.  Even  before  the  purchases  were
made,  intruders  in  large  numbers  had  settled  upon  each  of  the  tracts
in  question,  and  they  refused  to  withdraw  across  the  boundaries  now
established,  but  remained  on  one  pretext  or  another  to  await  a  new
adjustment.  This  was  particularly  the  case  on  Watauga  and  upper
Holston  rivers  in  northeastern  Tennessee,  where  the  settlers,  finding
themselves  still  within  the  Indian  boundary  and  being  resolved  to
remain,  effected  a  temporary  lease  from  (he  Cherokee  in  177l'.  As
was  expected  and  intended,  the  lease  beca    a  permanent  occupancy,

Americans.  There  was  good  reason  for  this.  Since  the  fall  of
the  French  power  the  British  government  had  stood  to  them  as  the
sole  representative  of  authority,  and  the  guardian  and  protector  of
their  rights  against  constant  encroachments  by  the  American  borderers.
Licensed  British  traders  were  resident  in  every  tribe  and  many  had
intermarried  and  raised  families  among  them,  while  the  bonier  man
looked  upon  the  Indian  only  as  a  cumberer  of  the  earth.  The  British
superintendents,  Sir  William  Johnson  in  the  north  and  Captain  John
Stuart  in  the  south,  they  knew  as  generous  friends,  while  hardly  a
warrior  of  them  all  was  without  some  old  cause  of  resentment  against
their  backwoods  neighbors.  They  felt  that  the  only  barrier  between
themselves  and  national  extinction  was  in  the  strength  of  the  British
government,  and  when  the  final  severence  came  they  threw  their
whole  power  into  the  British  scale.  They  were  encouraged  in  this
resolution  by  presents  of  clothing  and  other  Moods,  with  promises  of
plunder  from  the  settlement-  and  hopes  of  recovering  a  portion  of  their
lost  territories.  The  British  government  having  determined,  as  early
as  June,  1775.  to  call  in  the  Indians  against  the  Americans,  supplies
of  hatchets,  guns,  and  ammunition  were  issued  to  the  warriors  of  all
the  tribes  from  the  lakes  to  the  gulf,  and  bounties  were  offered  for
American  scalps  brought  in  to  the  commanding  officer  at  Detroit  or
Oswego.1  Even  the  Six  Nations,  w  ho  had  agreed  in  solemn  treaty  to
remain  neutral,  were  won  over  by  these  persuasions.  In  August,  177">.
an  Indian  "talk"  was  intercepted  in  which  the  Cherokee  assured  Cam- eron, the  resident  agent,  that  their  warriors,  enlisted  in  the  service  of
the  king,  were  ready  at  a  signal  to  tall  upon  the  back  settlements  of
Carolina  and  Georgia.2  Circular  letters  were  sent  out  to  all  those
persons  in  the  back  country  supposed  to  he  of  royalist  sympathies,
directing  them  to  repair  to  Cameron's  headquarters  in  the  Cherokee
country  to  join  the  Indians  in  the  invasion  of  the  settlements."
In  .Tune.  1776,  a  British  fleet  under  command  of  Sir  Peter  Parker,
with  a  large  aavaland  military  force,  attacked  Charleston,  South  Caro-
lina, both  by  land  and  sea.  and  simultaneously  a  body  of  ( 'herokee,  led
by  Tories  in  Indian  disguise,  came  down  from  the  mountains  and  ravaged
the  exposed  frontier  of  South  Carolina,  killing  and  burning  as  they
went.  After  a  gallant  defense  by  the  garrison  at  Charleston  the  British
were  repulsed,  whereupon  their  Indian  and  Tory  allies  withdrew.'
About  the  same  time  the  warning  came  from  Nancy  Ward  114).  a
noted  friendly  Indian  woman  of  "teat  authority  in  the  ( 'herokee  Nation.

destroying  everything  as  far  up  as  New  river.  The  Holston  men
from  b'oth  sides  of  the  Virginia  line  hastily  collected  under  Captain
Thompson  and  marched  againsl  the  Indians,  whom  they  met  and
defeated  with  signal  loss  after  a  hard-foughl  battle  near  the  Long
island  in  the  rlolston  (Kingsport,  Tennessee),  on  Augusl  20.  The

Watauga,  garrisoned  by  only  forty  men  under  ( Japtain  .lame-  Robert-
son (15),  but  was  repulsed  without  loss  to  the  defenders,  the  Indians
withdrawing  on  news  of  the  result  ai  the  Long  island.  A  Mrs.  Bean
and  a  boy  named  Moore  were  captured  on  this  occasion  and  carried  to
one  of  the  Cherokee  towns  in  the  neighborhood  of  Tellico,  where  the
boj  was  burned,  hut  tin'  woman,  after  she  had  been  condemned  to
death  and  everything  was  in  readiness  for  the  tragedy,  was  rescued  by
the  interpositi   f  Nancy  Ward.     Two  other  Cherokee  detachments
moved  against  the  upper  settlements  at  the  same  time.  One  of  these.
finding  all  the  inhabitants  securely  shut  up  in  forts,  returned  without
doing  much  damage.  The  other  ravaged  the  country  on  Clinch  river
almost  to  its  head,  and  killed  a  man  and  wounded  other-  at  Black's
station,  now  Abingdon,  Virginia.1
At  the  same  time  that  one  pari  of  the  Cherokee  were  raiding  the
Tennessee  settlements  others  came  down  upon  the  frontiers  of  Caro-
lina and  Georgia.  On  the  upper  Catawba  they  killed  many  people,  hut
the  whites  took  refuge  in  the  stockade  stations,  where  they  defended
themselves  until  General  Rutherford  (hi)  came  to  their  relief.  In
Georgia  an  attempt  had  been  made  by  a  small  party  of  Americans  to
seize  Cameron,  who  lived  in  one  of  the  Cherokee  towns  with  his  Indian
\\  ife.  hut.  as  was  to  have  been  expected,  the  Indians  interfered,  killing
several  of  the  party  and  capturing  others,  who  were  afterward  tortured
lo  death.  The  Cherokee  of  the  Upper  and  Mid. lie  town-,  with  some
Creeks  and  Tories  of  the  vicinity, led  by  Cameron  himself,  at  once
began  ravaging  the  South  Carolina  border,  burning  houses,  driving  off
cattle,  and  killing  men,  women,  and  children  without  distinction,  until
the  whole  country  was  in  a  wild  panic,  tin1  people  abandoning  their
farms  to  seek  safety  in  the  garrisoned  forts.  On  one  occasion  an
at  t  aids  by  two  hundred  of  the  enemy,  half  of  them  being  Tories,  stripped
and  painted  like  Indians,  was  repulsed  by  the  timely  arrival  of  a  body
of  Americans,  who  succeeded  in  capturing  thirteen  of  the  Tories.  The
invasion  extended  into  Georgia,  where  also  property  was  destroyed
and  the  inhabitants  were  driven  from  their  homes.'
Realizing  their  common  danger,  the  border  states  determined  to
strike  such  a  concerted  blow  at  the  Cherokee  as  should  render  them

i   nkv]       RUTHERFORD  AND  WILLIAMSON  EXPEDITIONS   177«>  49
in  the  summer  of  1776  four  expeditions  were  equipped  from  Virginia,
North  Carolina,  South  Carolina,  and  Georgia,  to  enter  the  Cherokee
territory  simultaneously  from  as  many  different  directions.
In  August  of  that  year  the  army  of  North  Carolina,  2,400  strong,
under  General  Griffith  Rutherford,  crossed  the  Blue  ridge  at  Swan-
nanoa  gap,  and  following  the  main  trail  almost  along  the  present  line
of  the  railroad,  struck  the  first  Indian  town,  Stika'yi,  or  Stecoee,  on
the  Tuekasegee,  near  the  present  Whittier.  The  inhabitants  having
fled,  the  soldiers  burned  the  town,  together  with  an  unfinished  town-
house  ready  for  the  roof,  cut  down  the  standing  corn,  killed  one  or
twostraggling  Indians,  and  then  proceeded  on  their  mission  of  destruc-
tion. Every  town  upon  Oconaluftee,  Tuekasegee,  and  the  upper
part  of  Little  Tennessee,  and  on  Hiwassee  to  below  the  junction  of
Valley  river — thirty-six  towns  in  all — was  destroyed  in  turn,  the  corn
cut  down  or  trampled  under  the  hoofs  of  the  stock  driven  into  the
fields  for  that  purpose,  and  the  stock  itself  killed  or  carried  off.  Before
such  an  overwhelming  force,  supplemented  as  it  was  by  three  others
simultaneously  advancing  from  other  directions,  the  Cherokee  made
but  poor  resistance,  and  tied  with  their  women  and  children  into  the
fastnesses  of  the  Great  Smoky  mountains,  leaving  their  desolated  fields
and  smoking  towns  behind  them.  As  was  usual  in  Indian  wars,  the
actual  number  killed  or  taken  was  small,  but  the  destruction  of  pro-
perty was  beyond  calculation.  At  Sugartown  (Kulsetsi'yi,  east  of  the
present  Franklin)  one  detachment,  sent  to  destroy  it.  was  surprised,
and  escaped  only  through  the  aid  of  another  force  sent  to  its  rescue.
Rutherford  himself,  while  proceeding  to  the  destruction  of  the  Hiwas-
see towns,  encountered  the  Indians  drawn  up  to  oppose  his  progress  in
the  Wayagap  of  the  Nantahala  mountains,  and  one  of  the  hardest  tights
of  the  campaign  resulted,  the  soldiers  losing  over  forty  killed  and
wounded,  although  the  Cherokee  were  finally  repulsed  (17).  One  of
the  Indians  killed  on  this  occasion  was  afterward  discovered  to  be  a
woman,  painted  and  armed  like  a  warrior.1
On  September  M  the  South  Carolina  army,  1,860  strong,  under
Colonel  Andrew  Williamson,  and  including  a  number  of  Catawba
Indians,  effected  a  junction  with  Rutherford's  forces  on  Hiwassee
river,  near  the  present  Murphy.  North  Carolina.  It  had  been  expected
that  Williamson  would  join  the  northern  army  at  Cowee,  on  the  Little
Tennessee,  when  they  would  proceed  together  against  the  western
towns,  but  he  had  been  delayed,  and  the  work  of  destruction  in  that
direction  was  already  completed,  so  that  after  a  short  rest  each  army
returned  home  along  the  route  by  which  it  had  come.

encountered  ( 'aineron  witti  his  Indian-  and  Tories,  they  had  destroyed six  thousand  bushels  of  corn,  besides  other  food  stores,  after  burning  all

most  serious  encounter  had  taken  place  at  Tomassee,  where  several

settlement  met  was  burned  ninety  houses  in  one  settlement  alone  and
detachments  were  sent  into  the  fields  to  destroy  the  corn,  of  which  the
smallest  town  was  estimated  to  have  two  hundred  acre-,  besides  pota-
toes, beans,  and  orchards  of  peach  trees.  The  store-  of  dressed  deer-
skins and  other  valuables  were  carried  off.  Everything  was  swept  clean,
and  the  Indians  who  were  not  killed  or  taken  were  driven,  homeless
refugees,  into  the  dark  recesses  of  Nantahala  or  painfully  made  their
way  across  to  the  Overhill  towns  in  Tennessee,  which  were  already

with  a  flag  of  truce  to  discuss  tonus.  Knowing  that  his  own  strength
was  overwhelming.  Christian  allowed  the  envoy  to  go  through  the
whole  camp  and  then  sent  him  back  with  the  message  that  there  could
be  no  terms  until  the  Cherokee  towns  had  been  destroyed.  Arriving
at  the  ford,  he  kindled  fires  and  made  all  preparations  as  if  intending
to  camp  there  for  several  days.  As  soon  as  night  fell,  however,  he
secretly  drew  off  half  his  force  and  crossed  the  river  lower  down,  to
come  upon  the  Indians  in  their  rear.  This  was  a  work  of  great  diffi-
culty; as  the  water  was  so  deep  that  it  came  up  almost  to  the  shoulders
of  the  men,  while  the  current  was  so  rapid  that  they  were  obliged  to
support  each  other  four  abreast  to  prevent  being  swept  off  their  feet.
However,  they  kept  their  guns  and  powder  dry.  On  reaching  the
other  side  they  were  surprised  to  find  no  enemy.  Disheartened  at  the
strength  of  the  invasion,  the  Indians  had  fled  without  even  a  show  of
resistance.  It  is  probable  that  nearly  all  their  men  and  resources  had
been  drawn  off  to  oppose  the  Carolina  forces  on  their  eastern  border.
and  the  few  who  remained  felt  themselves  unequal  to  the  contest.
Advancing  without  opposition,  Christian  reached  the  towns  on
Little  Tennessee  early  in  November,  and,  finding  them  deserted,  pro-
ceeded to  destroy  them,  one  after  another,  with  their  outlying  fields.
The  few  lingering  warriors  discovered  were  all  killed.  In  the  mean-
time messages  had  been  sent  out  to  the  farther  towns,  in  response  to
which  several  of  their  head  men  came  into  Christian's  camp  to  treat
for  peace.  On  their  agreement  to  surrender  all  the  prisoners  and
captured  stock  in  their  hands  and  to  cede  to  the  whites  all  the  disputed
territory  occupied  by  the  Tennessee  settlements,  as  soon  as  represent-
atives of  the  whole  tribe  could  be  assembled  in  the  spring,  Christian
consented  to  suspend  hostilities  and  retire  without  doing  further
injury.  An  exception  was  made  against  Tuskegee  and  another  town,
which  had  been  concerned  in  the  burning  of  the  boy  taken  from
Watauga,  already  noted,  and  these  two  were  reduced  to  ashes.  The
sacred  "peace  town,'"  Echota  (20),  had  not  been  molested.  Most  of the  troops  were  disbanded  on  their  return  to  the  Long  island,  but  a
part  remained  and  built  Fort  Patrick  Henry,  where  they  went  into
winter  quarters.1
From  incidental  notices  in  narratives  written  by  some  of  the  partici-
pants, we  obtain  interesting  side-lights  on  the  merciless  character  of  this
old  border  warfare.  In  addition  to  the  ordinary  destruction  of  war — the
burning  of  towns,  the  wasting  of  fruitful  fields,  and  the  killing  of  the
defenders — we  find  that  every  Indian  warrior  killed  was  scalped,  when
opportunity  permitted;  women,  as  well  as  men,  were  shot  down  and
afterward  ''helped  to  their  end";  and  prisoners  taken  were  put  up  at
auction  as  slaves  when  not  killed  on  the  spot.     Near  Tomassee  a  small

plentifully  supplied."  Continuing  to  another  town,  "we  engaged  in

they  held  a  service  of  prayer  for  their  success,  after  which  the  fresh
scalps  were  hung  upon  a  pole  above  the  gate  of  the  fort.  The  barba-
rous custom  of  scalping  to  which  the  border  men  had  become  habitu-
ated in  the  earlier  wars  was  practiced  upon  every  occasion  when
opportunity  presented,  at  least  upon  the  bodies  of  warriors,  and  the
South  Carolina  legislature  offered  a  bounty  of  seventy-five  pounds  for
every  warrior's  scalp,  a  higher  reward,  however,  being  offered  for
prisoners.'-  In  spite  of  all  the  bitterness  which  the  war  aroused  there seems  to  be  no  record  of  any  scalping  of  Tories  or  other  whites  by  the
Americans  (-1).
The  effect  upon  the  Cherokee  of  this  irruption  of  more  than  six
thousand  armed  enemies  into  their  territory  was  well  nigh  paralyzing.
More  than  fifty  of  their  towns  had  been  burned,  their  orchards  cut
down,  their  lields  wasted,  their  cattle  and  horses  killed  or  driven  off.
their  stores  of  buckskin  and  other  personal  property  plundered.
Hundreds  of  their  people  had  been  killed  or  had  died  of  starvation
and  exposure,  others  were  prisoners  in  the  hands  of  the  Americans,
and  some  had  been  sold  into  slavery.  Those  who  had  escaped  were
fugitives  in  the  mountains,  living  upon  acorns,  chestnuts,  and  wild
game,  or  were  refugees  with  the  British.'1  From  the  Virginia  line  to the  Chattahoochee  the  chain  of  destruction  was  complete.  For  the
present  at  least  any  further  resistance  was  hopeless,  and  they  were
compelled  to  sue  for  peace.
By  a  treaty  concluded  at  De Witts  Corners  in  South  Carolina  on  May
•Jo.  1777.  the  first  ever  made  with  the  new  states,  the  Lower  Cherokee
surrendered  to  the  conqueror  all  of  their  remaining  territory  in  South
Carolina,  excepting  a  narrow  strip  along  the  western  boundary.  Just
two  months  later,  on  July  20,  by  treaty  at  the  Long  island,  as  had  been
arranged  by  Christian  in  the  preceding  fall,  the  Middle  and  Upper
Cherokee  ceded  everything  east  of  the  Blue  ridge,  together  with  all
the  disputed  territory  on  the  'Watauga.  Nolichucky,  upper  Holston, and  New  rivers.  By  this  second  treaty  also  Captain  James  Robertson
was  appointed  agent  for  the  Cherokee,  to  reside  at  Echota.  to  watch
their  movements,  recover  any  captured  property,  and  prevent  their
correspondence  with  persons  unfriendly  to  the  American  cause.  As

were  negotiated  by  commissioners  from  the  four  states  adjoining  the
Cherokee  country,  the  territory  thus  acquired  being  parceled  oul  to
Sou tli  ( iarolina,  North  Carolina,  and  Tennessee.1
While  tlif  Cherokee  Nation  had  thus  been  compelled  to  a  treaty  of
peace,  a  very  considerable  portion  of  the  tribe  was  irreconcilably  hos-
tile to  the  Americans  and  refused  to  be  a  party  to  the  late  cessions,
especially  on  the  Tennessee  side.  Although  Ata-kullakulla  sen!  word
that  he  was  readj  with  five  hundred  young  warriors  to  fighl  for  the
Americans  against  the  English  or  Indian  enemy  whenever  called  upon,
Dragging-canoe  (Tsiyu-gunsi'ni),  who  had  led  the  opposition  against
the  Watauga  settlements,  declared  that  he  would  holdfast  to  Cameron's
talk  and  continue  to  make  war  upon  those  who  had  taken  his  hunting
grounds.  Under  his  leadership  some  hundreds  id'  the  most  warlike and  implacable  warriors  of  the  tribe,  with  their  families,  drew  out
from  the  Upper  and  Middle  towns  and  moved  far  down  upon  Tennes-
see river,  where  thej  established  new  settlements  on  Chickamauga
creek,  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  present  Chattanooga.  The  locality
appears  to  have  been  already  a  rendezvous  for  a  sort  of  Indian  ban-
ditti, who  sometimes  plundered  boats  disabled  in  the  rapids  at  this
point  while  descending  the  river.  Under  the  name  "Chickamaugas"
they  >oon  became  noted  for  their  uncompromising  and  never-ceasing
hostility.  In  ITs-J.  in  consequence  of  the  destruction  of  their  towns
liv  Sevier  and  Campbell,  they  abandoned  this  location  and  moved
farther  down  the  river,  where  they  built  what  were  afterwards  known
as  the  ••five  lower  towns."  viz.  Running  Water,  Nickajack,  Long Island.  Crow  town,  and  Lookout  Mountain  town.  These  were  all  on
the  extreme  western  Cherokee  frontier,  near  where  Tennessee  river
crosses  the  state  line,  the  first  three  being  within  the  present  limits' of
Tennessee,  while  Lookout  Mountain  town  and  Crow  town  were
respectively  in  the  adjacent  corners  of  Georgia  and  Alabama.  Their
population  was  recruited  from  Creeks.  Shawano,  and  white  Tories,  until
they  were  estimated  at  a  thousand  warriors.  Here  they  remained,
a  constant  thorn  in  the  side  of  Tennessee,  until  their  towns  were
destroyed  in  L794.'
The  expatriated  Lower  Cherokee  also  removed  to  the  farthest  west-
tern  border  of  their  tribal  territory,  where  they  might  hope  to  be
secure  from  encroachment  for  a  time  at  least,  and  built  new"  towns  for
themselves  on   the  upper  waters  of   the   Coosa.      Twenty  years  after-

ward  Hawkins  found  the  population  of  Willstown,  in  extreme  western
Georgia,  entirely  made  up  of  refugees  from  the  Savannah,  and  the
children  so  familiar  from  their  parents  with  stories  of  Williamson's
invasion  that  they  ran  screaming  from  the  face  of  a  white  man  (i^l').1
In  April.  1777.  the  legislature  of  North  Carolina,  of  which  Tennes-
see was  still  a  part,  authorized  bounties  of  land  in  the  new  territory  to
all  able-bodied  men  who  should  volunteer  against  the  remaining  hostile
Cherokee.  Under  this  act  companies  of  rangers  were  kept  along  the
exposed  border  to  cut  off  raiding  parties  of  Indians  and  to  protect  the
steady  advance  of  the  pioneers,  with  the  result  that  the  Tennessee  set-
tlements enjoyed  a  brief  respite  and  were  even  able  to  send  some  assist-
ance to  their  brethren  in  Kentucky,  who  were  sorely  pressed  by  the
Shawano  and  other  northern  tribes.2
The  war  between  England  ami  the  colonies  still  continued,  however,
and  the  British  government  was  unremitting  in  its  effort  to  secure  the
active  assistance  of  the  Indians.  With  the  Creeks  raiding  the  Georgia
ami  South  Carolina  frontier,  and  with  a  British  agent,  Colonel  Brown,
and  a  number  of  Tory  refugees  regularly  domiciled  at  Chickamauga,3
it  was  impossible  for  the  Cherokee  lone'  to  remain  quiet.  In  the
spring  of  177'.»  the  warning  came  from  Robertson,  stationed  at  Echota,
that  three  hundred  warriors  from  Chickamauga  had  started  against  the
back  settlements  of  North  Carolina.  Without  a  day's  delay  the  states of  North  Carolina  (including  Tennessee)  and  Virginia  united  to  send  a
strong  force  of  volunteers  against  them  under  command  of  Colonels
Shelby  and  Montgomery.  Descending  the  Holston  in  April  in  a  fleet
of  canoes  built  for  tin1  occasion,  they  took  the  Chickamauga  towns  so
completely  by  surprise  that  the  few  warriors  remaining  fled  to  the
mountains  without  attempting  to  give  battle.  Several  were  killed,
Chickamauga  and  the  outlying  villages  were  burned,  twenty  thousand
bushels  of  corn  were  destroyed  and  large  numbers  of  horses  and  cattle
captured,  together  with  a  great  quantity  of  goods  sent  by  the  British
Governor  Hamilton  at  Detroit  for  distribution  to  the  Indians.  The
success  of  this  expedition  frustrated  the  execution  of  a  project  by
Hamilton  for  uniting  all  the  northern  and  southern  Indians,  to  lie
assisted  by  British  regulars,  in  a  concerted  attack  along  the  whole
American  frontier.  ( )n  learning,  through  runnel's,  of  the  blow  that
had  befallen  them,  the  Chickamauga  warriors  gave  up  all  idea  of
invading  the  settlements,  and  returned  to  their  wasted  villages.1  They,
as  well  as  the  Creeks,  however,  kept  in  constant  communication  with

the  British  commander  in  Savannah.  In  this  year  also  a  delegation  of
Cherokee  \  isited  the  Ohio  towns  to  offer  condolences  on  the  death  of
the  noted  I  Delaware  chief,  White  ej  es.1
In  tlic  early  spring  of  L780  a  large  company  of  emigrants  under
Colonel  John  Donelson  descended  the  Holston  and  the  Tennessee  to
the  Ohio,  whence  they  ascended  the  Cumberland,  effected  a  junction
with  another  party  under  Captain  James  Robertson,  which  hud  just
arrived  by  a  toilsome  overland  route,  and  made  the  ti i-t  settlement  on
the  present  site  of  Nashville.  In  passing  the Chickamauga  towns  they
had  run  the  gauntlet  of  the  hostile  Cherokee,  who  pursued  them  for  a
considerable  distance  beyond  the  whirlpool  known  as  the  Suck,  where
the  river  breaks  through  the  mountain.  The  family  of  a  man  named
Stuart  being  infected  with  the  smallpox,  his  boat  dropped  behind,  and
all  on  board,  twenty-eight  in  number,  were  killed  or  taken  by  the
Indians,  their  cries  being  distinctly  heard  by  their  friends  ahead  who
were  unable  to  help  them.  Another  boat  having  run  upon  the  rocks,
the  three  women  in  it,  one  of  whom  had  become  a  mother  the  night
before,  threw  the  cargo  into  the  river,  and  then,  jumping  into  the
water,  succeeded  in  pushing  the  boat  into  the  current  while  the  hus-
band of  one  of  them  kept  the  Indians  at  bay  with  his  rifle.  The  infant
was  killed  in  the  confusion.  Three  cowards  attempted  to  escape,
without  thought  of  their  companions.  One  was  drowned  in  the  river;
the  other  two  were  captured  and  carried  to  Chickamauga.  where  one
was  burned  and  the  other  was  ransomed  by  a  trader.  The  rest  went
on  their  way  to  found  the  capital  of  a  new  commonwealth.2  As  if  in
retributive  justice,  the  smallpox  broke  out  in  the  Chickamauga  band  in
consequence  of  the  capture  of  Stuart's  family,  causing  the  death  of
a  great  number.'
The  British  having  reconquered  Georgia  and  South  Carolina  and
destroyed  all  resistance  in  the  south,  early  in  L780 Cornwallis,  with  his
subordinates,  Ferguson  and  the  merciless  Tarleton,  prepared  to  invade
North  Carolina  and  sweep  the  country  northward  to  Virginia.  The
Creeks  under  McGillivray  (S\).  and  a  number  of  the  Cherokee  under
various  local  chiefs,  together  with  the  Tories,  at  once  joined  his
standard.
While  the  Tennessee  backwoodsmen  were  gathered  at  a  barbecue  to
contest  for  a  shooting  prize,  a  paroled  prisoner  brought  a  demand
from  Ferguson  for  their  submission;  with  the  threat,  if  they  refused,
that  he  would  cross  the  mountains,  hang  their  leaders,  kill  every  man
found  in  arms  and  burn  every  settlement.  Up  to  this  time  the  moun-
tain men  had  confined  their  effort  to  holding  in  check  the  Indian
enemy,  but  now,  with  the   fate  of  the  Revolution  at  stake,  they  felt

that  the  time  for  wider  action  had  come.  They  resolved  not  to  await
the  attack,  hut  to  anticipate  it.  Without  order  or  authority  from
Congress,  without  tents,  commissary,  or  supplies,  the  Indian  fighters
of  Virginia.  North  Carolina,  and  Tennessee  quickly  assembled  at  the
Svcamore  shoals  of  the  Watauga  to  the  number  of  about  one  thousand
men  under  Campbell  of  Virginia,  Sexier  (24)  and  Shelby  of  Tennessee,
and  McDowell  of  North  Carolina.  Crossing  the  mountains,  they  met
Ferguson  at  Kings  mountain  in  South  Carolina  on  October  7.  1780,
and  gained  the  decisive  victory  that  turned  the  tide  of  the  Revolution
in  the  South.1
It  is  in  place  here  to  quote  a  description  of  these  men  in  buckskin,
white  by  blood  and  tradition,  but  half  Indian  in  habit  and  instinct,
who,  in  half  a  century  of  continuous  conflict,  drove  back  Creeks,
Cherokee,  and  Shawano,  and  with  one  hand  on  the  plow  and  the  other
on  the  rifle  redeemed  a  wilderness  and  carried  civilization  and  free
government  to  the  banks  of  the  Mississippi.
"They  were  led  by  leaders  they  trusted,  they  were  wonted  to  Indian
warfare,  they  were  skilled  as  horsemen  and  marksmen,  they  knew  how
to  face  every  kind  of  danger,  hardship,  and  privation.  Their  fringed
and  tasseled  hunting  shirts  were  girded  by  bead-worked  belts,  and  the
trappings  of  their  horses  were  stained  red  and  yellow.  On  their  heads
they  wore  caps  of  coon  skin  or  mink  skin,  with  the  tails  hanging
down,  or  else  felt  hats,  in  each  of  which  was  thrust  a  buck  tail  or  a
sprig  of  evergreen.  Every  man  carried  a  small-bore  rifle,  a  toma-
hawk, and  a  scalping  knife.  A  very  few  of  the  officers  had  swords,
and  there  was  not  a  bayonet  nor  a  tent  in  the  army."2
To  strike  the  blow  at  Kings  mountain  the  border  men  had  been
forced  to  leave  their  own  homes  unprotected.  Even  before  they  could
cross  the  mountains  on  their  return  the  news  came  that  the  Cherokee
were  again  out  in  force  for  the  destruction  of  the  upper  settlements,
and  their  numerous  small  bauds  were  killing,  burning,  and  plundering
in  the  usual  Indian  fashion.  Without  loss  of  time  the  Holston  settle-
ments of  Virginia  and  Tennessee  at  once  raised  seven  hundred  mounted
riflemen  to  march  against  the  enemy,  the  command  being  assigned  to
Colonel  Arthur  Campbell  of  Virginia  and  Colonel  John  Sexier  of
Tennessee.
Sevier  started  first  with  nearly  three  hundred  men,  going  south
along  the  great  Indian  war  trail  and  driving  small  parties  of  the
Cherokee  before  him,  until  he  crossed  the  French  Broad  and  came
upon  seventy  of  them  on  Boyds  creek,  not  far  from  the  present  Sex  in  -
ville,  on  December  16,  1780.  Ordering  his  men  to  spread  out  into  a
half  circle,  he  sent  ahead  some  scouts,  who,  by  an  attack  and  feigned
retreat,  managed  to  draw  the  Indians  into  the  trap  thus  prepared,

A  few  days  later  Sevier  was  joined  by  ( ampbell  with  1 1 1  *  -  remainder
of  tin'  force.  Advancing  to  the  Little  Tennessee  with  but  slight
resistance,  thej  crossed  three  miles  below  Echota  while  the  Indians
were  watching  for  them  at  the  f oi'd  above.  Then  dividing  into  two
bodies,  thej  proceeded  to  destroy  the  town-  along  the  river.  The
chiefs  sent  peace  talks  through  Nancy  Ward,  the  Cherokee  woman
who  had  so  befriended  the  whites  in  177H.  but  to  these  overtures
Campbell  returned  an  evasive  answer  until  he  could  first  destroy
the  town-  on  lower  Hiwassee,  whose  warriors  had  been  particularly
hostile.  Continuing  southward,  the  troops  destroyed  these  town-.
Hiwassee  and  Chestuee,  with  all  their  stoic-  of  provisions,  finishing
the  work  on  the  last  day  of  the  year.  The  Indians  had  lied  before
them,  keeping  -pie-  out  to  watch  their  movements.  One  of  these,
while  giving  signals  from  a  ridge  by  beating  a  drum,  was  -hot  by  the
white-.  The  soldiers  lost  only  one  man.  who  was  buried  in  an  Indian
cabin  which  was  then  burned  down  to  conceal  the  trace  of  the  inter-
ment. The  return  march  was  begun  on  New  Year's  day.  Ten  prin-
v  cipal  towns,  including  Echota,  the  capital,  had  been  destroyed,  besides
several  smaller  villages,  containing  in  the  aggregate  over  one  thousand
house-,  and  not  less  than  fifty  thousand  bushels  of  corn  and  large  stores
of  other  provision.  Everything  not  needed  on  the  return  march
was  committed  to  the  flames  or  otherwise  wasted.  Of  all  the  towns
west  of  the  mountains  only  Talassee,  and  one  or  two  about  Chicka-
mauga  or  on  the  headwaters  of  the  Coosa,  escaped.  The  whites  had
lost  only  one  man  killed  and  two  wounded.  Before  the  return  a
proclamation  was  sent  to  the  Cherokee  chief-,  warning  them  to  make
peace  on  penalty  of  a  worse  visitation." Some  Cherokee  who  met  them  at  Echota.  on  the  return  march,  to
talk  of  peace,  brought  in  and  surrendered  several  white  prisoners.1
One  rea-on  for  the  slight  resistance  made  by  the  Indians  was  prob-
ably the  fact  that  at  the  very  time  of  the  invasion  many  of  their
warriors  were  away,  raiding  on  the  Upper  Holston  and  in  the  neigh-
borhood of  Cumberland  gap.'
Although  the  Upper  or  Overhill  Cherokee  were  thus  humbled,
those  of  the  middle  towns,  on  the  head  waters  id'  Little  Tennessee,  still
continued  to  send  out  parties  against  the  back  settlements.     Sevier

determined  to  make  a  sudden  stroke  upon  them,  and  early  in  March
of  the  same  year.  1781,  with  150  picked  horsemen,  he  started  to  cross
the  Great  Smoky  mountains  over  trails  never  before  attempted  by
white  men.  and  so  rough  in  places  that  it  was  hardly  possible  to  lead
horses.  Falling  unexpectedly  upon  Tuckasegee,  near  the  present
Webster,  North  Carolina,  he  took  the  town  completely  by  surprise,
killing  several  warriors  and  rapturing- a  number  of  women  and  chil-
dren. Two  other  principal  towns  and  three  smaller  .settlements  were
taken  in  the  same  way.  with  a  quantity  of  provision  and  about  200
horses,  the  Indians  being  entirely  off  their  guard  and  unprepared  to
make  any  effective  resistance.  Having  spread  destruction  through
the  middle  towns,  with  the  loss  to  himself  of  only  one  man  killed  and
another  wounded,  he  was  off  again  as  suddenly  as  he  had  come,  moving
so  rapidly  that  he  was  well  on  his  homeward  way  before  the  Cherokee
could  gather  for  pursuit.1  At  the  same  time  a  smaller  Tennessee  expe-
dition wrent  out  to  disperse  the  Indians  who  had  been  making  head-
quarters in  the  mountains  about  Cumberland  gap  and  harassing  travelers
along  the  road  to  Kentucky.-  Numerous  indications  of  Indians  were
found,  hut  none  were  met, although  the  country  was  scoured  for  a  con-
siderable distance.3  In  summer  the  Cherokee  made  another  incursion,
this  time  upon  the  new  settlements  on  the  French  Broad,  near  the  present
Newport,  Tennessee.  With  a  hundred  horsemen  Sexier  fell  suddenly

tered the  rest.1  By  these  successive  blows  the  Cherokee  were  so  worn
out  and  dispirited  that  they  were  forced  to  sue  for  peace,  and  in  mid-
summer of  1781  a  treaty  of  peace  -doubtful  though  it  might  be — was
negotiated  at  the  Long  island  of  the  Holston.5  Tin'  respite  came  just
in  time  to  allow  the  Tennesseeaus  to  send  a  detachment  against  Corn-
wallis.
Although  there  was  truce  in  Tennessee,  there  was  none  in  the  South.
In  November  of  this  year  the  Cherokee  made  a  sudden  inroad  upon
the  Georgia  settlements,  destroying  everything  in  their  way.  In
retaliation  a  force  under  General  Pickens  marched  into  their  country,
destroying  their  towns  as  far  as  Valley  river.  Finding  further  prog-
ress blocked  by  heavy  snows  and  learning  through  a  prisoner  that  the
Indians,  who  had  retired  before  him,  were  collecting  to  oppose  him  in
the  mountains,  he  withdrew,  as  he  says,  "through  absolute  necessity,"
having  accomplished  very  little  of  the  result  expected.  Shortly  after-

constant  warfare  they  had  been  reduced  to  the  lowest  depth  of  misery,
almost  indeed  to  the  verge  of  extinction.  Over  and  over  again  their
towns  had  been  laid  in  ashes  and  their  fields  wasted.  Their  best  war-
riors had  been  killed  and  their  women  and  children  had  sickened  and

ing' the  treaty  of  Augusta  already  noted.4  we  come  to  the  turning-
point  in  the  history  of  the  Cherokee,  their  first  treaty  with  the  new
government  of  the  United  States  for  peace  and  boundary  delimitation,
concluded  at  Hopewell  (25)  in  South  Carolina  on  November  28,  17s.">. Nearly  one  thousand  Cherokee  attended,  the  commissioners  for  the
United  States  being  Colonel  Benjamin  Hawkins  (liti).  of  North  Caro-
lina; General  Andrew  Pickens,  of  South  Carolina;  Cherokee  Agent
Joseph  Martin,  of  Tennessee,  and  Colonel  Lachlan  Mcintosh,  of
Georgia.  The  instrument  was  signed  by  thirty-seven  chiefs  and  prin-
cipal men.  representing  nearly  as  many  different  towns.  The  negotia-
tions occupied  ten  days,  being  complicated  by  a  protest  on  the  part  of
North  Carolina  and  Georgia  against  the  action  of  the  government  com-
missioners in  confirming  to  the  Indians  some  lands  which  had  already
been  appropriated  as  bounty  lands  for  state  troops  without  the  consent
of  the  Cherokee.  On  the  other  hand  the  Cherokee  complained  that
3,000  white  settlers  were  at  that  moment  in  occupancy  of  unceded  land
between  the  Holston  and  the  French  Broad.  In  spite  of  their  protest
these  intruders  were  allowed  to  remain,  although  the  territory  was
not  acquired  by  treaty  until  some  years  later.  As  finally  arranged

creek  running  into  Tennessee  river  a<  the  western  line  of  Alabama.
thence  northward  with  the  Tennessee  river  to  the  beginning.  The
lands  south  and  west  of  these  lines  were  recognized  as  belonging  to  the
Creeks  and  Chickasaw.  Hostilities  were  to  cease  and  the  Cherokee
were  taken  under  the  protection  of  the  United  States.  The  proceed-
ings ended  with  the  distribution  of  a  few  presents.1
While  the  Hopewell  treaty  defined  the  relations  of  the  Cherokee  to
the  general  government  and  furnished  a  safe  basis  for  future  negotia-
tion, it  yet  failed  to  bring  complete  peace  and  security.  Thousands
of  intruders  were  still  settled  on  Indian  lands,  and  minor  aggressions
and  reprisals  were  continually  occurring.  The  Creeks  and  the  north-
ern tribes  were  still  hostile  and  remained  so  for  some  years  later,  and
their  warriors,  cooperating  with  those  of  the  implacable  Chickamauga
towns,  continued  to  annoy  the  exposed  settlements,  particularly  on  the
Cumberland.  The  British  had  withdrawn  from  the  South,  but  the
Spaniards  and  French,  who  claimed  the  lower  Mississippi  and  the
Gulf  region  and  had  their  trading  posts  in  west  Tennessee,  took  every
opportunity  to  encourage  the  spirit  of  hostility  to  the  Americans. ' But  the  spirit  of  the  Cherokee  nation  was  broken  and  the  Holston
settlements  were  now  too  surely  established  to  be  destroyed.
The  Cumberland  settlements  founded  by  Robertson  and  Donelson  in
the  winter  of  1779-80  had  had  but  short  respite.  Early  in  spring  the
Indians  Cherokee.  Creeks.  Chickasaw,  and  northern  Indians  had
begun  a  scries  of  attacks  with  the  design  of  driving  these  intruders
from  their  lands,  and  thenceforth  for  years  no  man's  life  was  safe  out- side the  stockade.  The  long  list  of  settlers  shot  down  at  work  or  while
hunting  in  the  woods,  of  stock  stolen  and  property  destroyed,  while
of  sorrowful  interest  to  those  most  nearly  concerned,  is  too  tedious  for
recital  here,  and  only  leading  events  need  be  chronicled.  Detailed
notice  may  be  found  in  the  works  of  local  historians.

the  noise  and  sprang  up  just  in  time  to  rouse  the  garrison  and  beat  off
the  assailants,  who  continued  to  fire  through  the  loopholes  after  they
had  been  driven  out  of  the  fort.  Only  two  Americana  were  killed,
although  the  escape  was  a  narrow  one.1
About  three  months  later,  on  April  2,  a  large  body  of  Cherokee
approached  the  fort  at  Nashville  (then  called  Nashborough,  or  simply
'"the  Bluff"),  and  by  sending  a  decoy  ahead  succeeded  in  drawing  a
large  part  id'  the  garrison  into  an  ambush.  It  seemed  that  they  would
be  cut  otl'.  as  the  Indians  were  between  them  and  the  fort,  when  those
inside  loosed  the  dogs,  which  rushed  so  furiously  upon  the  Indians
that  the  latter  found  work  enough  to  defend  themselves,  and  were
finally  forced  to  retire,  carrying  with  them,  however,  five  American
scalps. 2 The  attacks  continued  throughout  this  and  the  next  year  to  such  an
extent  that  it  seemed  at  one  time  as  if  the  Cumberland  settlements
must  be  abandoned,  but  in  June.  1783,  commissioners  from  Virginia
and  North  Carolina  arranged  a  treaty  near  Nashville  (Nashborough)

although  it  did  not  completely  stop  the  Indian  inroads,  at  least  greatly
diminished  them.  Thereafter  the  Chickasaw  remained  friendly,  and

in  the  vicinity  of  the,  present  Knoxville,  Tennessee.  In  retaliation
Sevier  again  marched  his  volunteers  across  the  mountain  to  the  valley
towns  and  destroyed  three  of  them,  killing  a  number  of  warriors;  but  he
retired  on  learning  that  the  Indians  were  gathering  to  give  him  battle.4
In  the  springof  this year  Agent  Martin,  stationedat  Echota,  had  made
a  tour  of  inspection  of  the  Cherokee  towns  and  reported  that  they
were  generally  friendly  and  anxious  for  peace,  with  the  exception  of
the  Chickamauga  band,  under  Dragging-canoe,  who,  acting  with  the
hostile  ('reeks  and  encouraged  by  the  French  and  Spaniard-,  were
making  preparations  to  destroy  the  Cumberland  settlements.  Not-

called,  concluded  a  negotiation,  locally  known  as  the  "treat}'  of
Coyatee,"  with  the  chiefs  of  the  Overhill  towns.  In  spite  of  references
to  peace,  love,  and  brotherly  friendship,  it  is  very  doubtful  if  the  era
of  good  will  was  in  any  wise  hastened  by  the  so-called  treaty,  as  the
Tennesseeans,  who  bad  just  burned  another  Indian  town  in  reprisal  for
the  killing  of  a  white  man.  announced,  without  mincing  words,  that
they  had  been  given  by  North  Carolina  against  which  state,  l>\  the
way,  they  were  then  in  organized  rebellion  the  whole  country  north
of  the  Tennessee  river  as  far  west  as  the  Cumberland  mountain,  and
that  they  intended  to  take  it  "by  the  -word,  which  is  the  best  right  to
all  countries."      As  the  whole  of  this  country  was  within  the  limits  of
the  territory  solemnly  guaranteed  to  the  Cherokee  by  the   Hopewell
treaty  only  the  year  before,  the  chiefs  simply  replied  that  Congress
had  -aid  nothing  to  them  on  the  subject,  and  SO  the  matter  rested.1
The  theory  of  state's  rights  was  too  complicated  for  the  Indian  under-
standing.
While  this   conflict   between  state   and    federal   authority  continued,
with   the    Cherokee   lands   as   the   prize,    there  could   lie  no   peace.       In
March,   L787,  a   letter  from   Echota,  apparently  written    by  Agent
Martin,  speaks  of  a  recent  expedition  against  the  Cherokee  towns,
and  the  confusion  and  alarm  among  them  inconsequence  of  the  daily
encroachments  of  the  "Franklinites"  or  Tennesseeans,  who  had  pro-
ceeded to  make  good  their  promise  by  opening  ;i  hind  office  for  the  sale
of  all  the  lands  southward  to  Tennessee  river,  including  even  apart  id' the beloved  town  of  Echota.  At  the  same  time  messengers  were  coming
to  the  Cherokee  from  traders  in  the  foreign  interest,  telling  them  that
England,  France,  and  Spain  had  combined  against  the  Americans  and
urging  them  with  promises  of  c-uns  and  ammunition  to  join  in  the
war. '  As  a  result  each  further  advance  of  the  Tennessee  settlements,
in  defiance  as  it  was  of  any  recognized  treaty,  was  stubbornly  con-
tested by  the  Indian  owners  of  the  land.  The  record  of  these  encoun-
ters, extending  over  a  period  of  several  years,  is  too  tedious  for  recital.
"Could  a  diagram  he  drawn,  accurately  designating  every  spot  sig-
nalized by  an  Indian  massacree,  surprise,  or  depredation,  or  courageous
attack,  defense,  pursuit,  or  victory  by  the  whites,  or  station  or  fort
or  battlefield,  or  personal  encounter,  the  whole  of  that  section  of
country  would  lie  studded  over  with  delineations  of  such  incidents.
Every  spring,  every  ford,  every  path,  every  farm,  every  trail,  every
house  nearly,  in  its  first  settlement,  was  once  the  scene  of  danger,

allies  upon  the  Georgia  frontier  and  the  Cumberland  settlements
around  Nashville  became  so  threatening  that  measures  were  taken  for
a  joint  campaign  by  the  combined  forces  of  Georgia  and  Tennessee
("Franklin").  The  enterprise  came  to  naught  through  the  interfer-
ence of  the  federal  authorities.1  All  through  the  year  1788  we  hear
of  attacks  and  reprisals  along  the  Tennessee  border,  although  the
agent  for  the  Cherokee  declared  in  his  official  report  that,  with  the
exception  of  the  Chickamauga  band,  the  Indians  wished  to  lie  at
peace  if  the  whites  would  let  them.  In  March  two  expeditions  under
Sevier  and  Kennedy  set  out  against  the  towns  in  the  direction  of  the
French  Broad.  In  May  several  persons  of  a  family  named  Kirk  were
murdered  a  few  miles  south  of  Knoxville.  In  retaliation  Sevier
raised  a  large  party  and  marching  against  a  town  on  Hiwassee  river —
one  of  those  which  had  been  destroyed  some  years  before  and  rebuilt —
and  burned  it.  killing  a  number  of  the  inhabitants  in  the  river  while
they  were  trying  to  escape.  lie  then  turned,  and  proceeding  to  the
towns  on  Little  Tennessee  burned  several  of  them  also,  killing  a  num-
ber of  Indians.  Here  a  small  party  of  Indians,  including  Abraham
and  Tassel,  two  well-known  friendly  chiefs,  was  brutally  massacred
by  one  of  the  Kirks,  no  one  interfering,  after  they  had  voluntarily
come  in  on  request  of  one  of  the  officers.  This  occurred  during  the
temporary  absence  of  Sevier.  Another  expedition  under  Captain
Favne  was  drawn  into  an  ambuscade  at  Citico  town  and  lost  several
in  killed  and  wounded.  The  Indians  pursued  the  survivors  almost  to
Knoxville,  attacking  a  small  station  near  the  present  Maryville  by
the  way.  They  were  driven  off  by  Sevier  and  others,  who  in  turn
invaded  the  Indian  settlements,  crossing  the  mountains  and  penetra-
ting as  far  as  the  valley  towns  on  Hiwassee.  hastily  retiring  as  they
found  the  Indians  gathering  in  their  front.2  In  the  same  summer
another  expedition  was  organized  against  the  Chickamauga  towns.
The  chief  command  was  given  to  General  Martin,  who  left  White's
fort,  now  Knoxville.  with  four  hundred  and  fifty  men  and  made  a
rapid  inarch  to  the  neighborhood  of  the  present  Chattanooga,  where
the  main  force  encamped  on  the  site  of  an  old  Indian  settlement.  A
detachment  sent  ahead  to  surprise  a  town  a  few  miles  farther  down
the  river  was  fired  upon  and  driven  back,  and  a  general  engagement
took  place  in  the  narrow  pass  between  the  bluff  and  the  river,  with

overpowered  af  ter  a  shorl  resistance,  and  twenty-eight  persons,  includ-
ing several  women  and  children,  were  killed.  The  Indians  left  behind
a  Letter  signed  by  four  chiefs,  including  John  Watts,  expressing
regret  for  what  they  called  the  accidental  lolling  of  the  women  and
children,  reminding  the  whites  of  their  own  treachery  in  killing
Abraham  and  the  Tassel,  and  defiantly  concluding,  "When  you  move
off  the  land,  then  we  will  make  peace."  Other  exposed  stations  were
attacked,  until  at  last  Sevier  again  mustered  a  force,  cleared  the
enemy  from  the  frontier,  and  pursued  the  Indians  as  far  as  their
towns  on  the  head  waters  of  Coosa  river,  in  such  vigorous  fashion  that
they  were  compelled  to  ask  for  terms  of  peace  and  agree  to  a  surrender
of  prisoners,  which  was  accomplished  at  Coosawatee  town,  in  upper
Georgia,  in  the  following  April.1 Among  the  captives  thus  restored  to  their  friends  were  Joseph
Brown,  a  boy  of  sixteen,  with  his  two  younger  sisters,  who,  with
several  others,  had  been  taken  at  Nickajack  town  while  descending
the  Tennessee  in  a  fiatboat  nearly  a  year  before.  His  father  and  the
other  men  of  the  party,  about  ten  in  all,  had  been  killed  at  the  time.
while  the  mother  and  several  other  children  were  carried  to  various
Indian  towns,  some  of  them  going  to  the  Creeks,  who  had  aided  the
Cherokee  in  the  capture.  Young  Brown,  whose  short  and  simple
narrative  is  of  vivid  interest,  was  at  first  condemned  to  death,  but  was
rescued  by  a  white  man  living  in  the  town  and  was  afterward  adopted
into  the  family  of  the  chief,  in  spite  of  the  warning  of  an  old  Indian
woman  that  if  allowed  to  live  he  would  one  day  guide  an  army  to
destroy  them.  The  warning  was  strangely  prophetic,  for  it  was
Brown  himself  who  guided  the  expedition  that  finally  rooted  out  the
Chickamauga  towns  a  few  years  later.  When  rescued  at  Coosawatee
he  was  in  Indian  costume,  with  shirt,  breechcloth,  scalp  lock,  and
holes  bored  in  his  ears.  His  little  sister,  five  years  old.  had  become
so  attached  to  the  Indian  woman  who  had  adopted  her.  that  she
refused  to  go  to  her  own  mother  ami  had  to  be  pulled  alone-  by  force.3
The  mother  and  another  of  the  daughters,  who  had  been  taken  by  the
Creeks,  were  afterwards  ransomed  by  McGillivray,  head  chief  of  the
Creek  Nation,  who  restored  them  to  their  friends,  generously  refusing
any  compensation  for  his  kindness.
An  arrangement  had  been  made  with  the  Chickasaw,  in  1783,  by
which  they  surrendered  to  the  Cumberland  settlement  their  own  claim
to  the  lands  from  the  Cumberland  river  south  to  the  dividing  ridge  of
Duck  river.3  It  was  not,  however,  until  the  treaty  of  Hopewell,  two
years  later,  that  the  Cherokee  surrendered  their  claim  to  the  same
region,  and  even  then  the  Chickamauga  warriors,  with  their  allies,  the

hostile  Creeks  and  Shawano,  refused  to  acknowledge  the  cession  and
continued  their  attacks,  with  the  avowed  purpose  of  destroying  the  new
settlements.  Until  the  final  running  of  the  boundary  line,  in  1797,
Spain  claimed  all  the  territory  west  of  the  mountains  and  south  of
Cumberland  river,  and  her  agents  were  accused  of  stirring  up  the
Indians  against  the  Americans,  even  to  the  extent  of  offering  rewards
for  American  scalps.1  One  of  these  raiding  parties,  which  had  killed
the  brother  of  Captain  Robertson,  was  tracked  to  Coldwater,  a  small
mixed  town  of  Cherokee  and  Creeks,  on  the  south  side  of  Tennessee
river,  about  the  present  Tuscumbia,  Alabama.  Robertson  determined
to  destroy  it,  and  taking  a  force  of  volunteers,  with  a  couple  of  Chick-
asaw guides,  crossed  the  Tennessee  without  being  discovered  and
surprised  and  burnt  the  town.  The  Indians,  who  numbered  less  than
fifty  men,  attempted  to  escape  to  the  river,  but  were  surrounded  and
over  twenty  of  them  killed,  with  a  loss  of  but  one  man  to  the  Tennes-
seeans.  In  the  town  were  found  also  several  French  traders.  Three
of  these,  who  refused  to  surrender,  were  killed,  together  with  a  white
woman  who  was  accidentally  shot  in  one  of  the  boats.  The  others
were  afterward  released,  their  large  stock  of  trading  goods  having
been  taken  and  sold  for  the  benefit  of  the  troops.  The  affair  took
place  about  the  end  of  June.  1787.  Through  this  action,  and  an  effort
made  by  Robertson  about  the  same  time  to  come  to  an  understanding
with  the  Chickaniauga  band,  there  was  a  temporary  cessation  of
hostile  inroads  upon  the  Cumberland,  but  long  before  the  end  of  the
year  the  attacks  were  renewed  to  such  an  extent  that  it  was  found
necessary  to  keep  out  a  force  of  rangers  with  orders  to  scour  the
country  and  kill  every  Indian  found  east  of  the  Chickasaw  boundary.2
The  Creeks  seeming  now  to  be  nearly  as  much  concerned  in  these
raids  as  the  Cherokee,  a  remonstrance  was  addressed  to  McGillivray,
their  principal  chief,  who  replied  that,  although  the  Creeks,  like  the
other  southern  tribes,  had  adhered  to  the  British  interest  during  the
Revolution,  they  had  accepted  proposals  of  friendship,  but  while
negotiations  were  pending  six  of  their  people  had"  been  killed  in  the affair  at  Coldwater.  which  had  led  to  a  renewal  of  hostile  feeling.  He
promised,  however,  to  use  his  best  efforts  to  bring  about  peace,  and
seems  to  have  kept  his  word,  although  the  raids  continued  through
this  and  the  next  year,  with  the  usual  sequel  of  pursuit  and  reprisal.
In  one  of  these  skirmishes  a  company  under  Captain  Murray  followed
some  Indian  raiders  from  near  Nashville  to  their  camp  on  Tennessee
river  and  succeeded  in  killing  the  whole  party  of  eleven  warriors.1
A  treaty  of  peace  was  signed  with  the  Creeks  in  1790,  but,  owing  to
the  intrigues  of  the  Spaniards,  it  had  little  practical  effect,4  and  not

I!v  deed  of  cession  of  February  .!•">.  17'.»n.  Tennessee  ceased  to  be  a
pari  of  North  <  larolina  and  was  organized  under  federal  laws  as  "  The
Territory  of  the  United  Mate-  south  of  the  <  >hio  river,"  preliminary
to  taking  full  rank  as  a  state  six  year-  later.  William  Blount  (27)
was  appointed  lir-t  territorial  governor  and  also  superintendent  for  the
southern  Indian-,  with  a  deputy  resident  with  each  of  the  four  prin-
cipal tribes.1  Pensacola,  Mobile,  St.  Louis,  and  other  southern  posts
were  -till  held  by  the  Spaniard-,  who  claimed  the  whole  country  south
of  the  Cumberland,  while  the  British  garrisons  had  not  yet  been  with-
drawn from  the  north.  The  resentment  of  the  Indians  at  the  occupancy
of  their  reserved  and  guaranteed  lands  by  the  whites  was  sedulously
encouraged  from  both  quarters,  and  raids  alone-  the  Tennessee  fron-
tier were  of  common  occurrence.  At  this  time,  according  to  the
official  report  of  President  Washington,  over  five  hundred  families  of
intruders  were  settled  upon  lands  belonging  rightly  to  the  Cherokee.
in  addition  to  those  between  the  French  Broad  and  the  Holston.2
More  than  a  year  before  the  Secretary  of  War  had  stated  that  "the
disgraceful  violation  of  the  treaty  of  Hopewell  with  the  Cherokee
requires  the  serious  consideration  of  Congress.  If  so  direct  and  man-
ifest contempt  of  the  authority  of  the  United  States  tie  suffered  with
impunity,  it  will  he  in  vain  to  attempt  to  extend  the  arm  of  govern-
ment to  the  frontiers.  The  Indian  tribes  can  have  no  faith  in  such
imbecile  promises,  and  the  lawless  whites  will  ridicule  a  government
which  shall  on  paper  only  make  Indian  treaties  and  regulate  Indian
boundaries."3  To  prevent  any  increase  of  the  dissatisfaction,  the
general  government  issued  a  proclamation  forbidding  any  further
encroachment  upon  the  Indian  kinds  on  Tennessee  river;  notwith-
standing which,  early  in  L791,  a  party  of  men  descended  the  river  in
boats,  and.  landing  on  an  island  at  the  Muscle  shoals,  near  the  present
ruscumbia,  Alabama,  erected  a  blockhouse  and  other  defensive  works.
Immediately  afterward  the  Cherokee  chitd'.  Class,  with  about  sixty warriors,  appeared  and  quietly  informed  them  that  if  they  did  notat
once  withdraw  he  would  kill  them.  After  some  parley  the  intruders
retired  to  their  boats,  when  the  Indians  set  tire  to  the  buildings  and
reduced  them  to  ashes.'
To  forestall  more  serious  difficulty  it  was  necessary  to  negotiate  a
new  treaty  with  a  view  to  purchasing  the  disputed  territory.  Accord-
ingly, through  the  efforts  of  Governor  Blount,  a  convention  was  held
with  the  principal   men  of  the  Cherokee  at  White's  fort,  now  Knox-

ville,  Tennessee,  in  the  summer  of  1791.  AYith  much  difficulty  the
Cherokee  were  finally  brought  to  consent  to  a  cession  of  a  triangular
section  in  Tennessee  and  North  Carolina  extending  from  Clinch  river
almost  to  the  Blue  ridge,  and  including  nearly  the  whole  of  the
French  Broad  and  the  lower  Holston,  with  the  sites  of  the  present
Knoxville,  Greenville,  and  Asheville.  The  whole  of  this  area,  with  a
considerable  territory  adjacent,  was  already  fully  occupied  by  the
whites.  Permission  was  also  given  for  a  road  from  the  eastern
settlements  to  those  on  the  Cumberland,  with  the  free  navigation  of
Tennessee  river.  Prisoners  on  both  sides  were  to  be  restored  and
perpetual  peace  was  guaranteed.  In  consideration  of  the  lands  sur-
rendered the  Cherokee  were  to  receive  an  annuity  of  one  thousand
dollars  with  some  extra  goods  and  some  assistance  on  the  road  to
civilization.  A  treaty  was  signed  by  forty-one  principal  men  of  the
tribe  and  was  concluded  July  2, 1791.  It  is  officially  described  as  being
held  "on  the  bank  of  the  Holston,  near  the  mouth  of  the  French
Broad."  and  is  commonly  spoken  of  as  the  "treaty  of  Holston." The  Cherokee,  however,  were  dissatisfied  with  the  arrangement,
and  before  the  end  of  the  year  a  delegation  of  six  principal  chiefs
appeared  at  Philadelphia,  then  the  seat  of  government,  without  any
previous  announcement  of  their  coming,  declaring  that  when  they  had
1   n  summoned  by  Governor  Blount  to  a  conference  they  were  not
aware  that  it  was  to  persuade  them  to  sell  lands;  that  they  had
resisted  the  proposition  for  days,  and  only  yielded  when  compelled
by  the  persistent  and  threatening  demands  of  the  governor;  that  the
consideration  was  entirely  too  small;  and  that  they  had  no  faith  that
the  whites  would  respect  the  new  boundary,  as  they  were  in  fact
already  settling  beyond  it.  Finally,  as  the  treaty  had  been  signed,
they  asked  that  these  intruders  be  removed.  As  their  presentation  of
the  case  seemed  a  just  one  and  it  was  desirable  that  they  should  carry
home  with  them  a  favorable  impression  of  the  government's  attitude
toward  them,  a  supplementary  article  was  added,  increasing-  the
annuity  to  eight  thousand  five  hundred  dollars.  On  account  of  renewed
Indian  hostilities  in  Ohio  valley  and  the  desire  of  the  government  to
keep  the  good  will  of  the  Cherokee  long  enough  to  obtain  their  help
against  the  northern  tribes,  the  new  line  was  not  surveyed  until  17'.*7.'
As  illustrating  Indian  custom  it  may  be  noted  that  one  of  the  prin-
cipal signers  of  the  original  treaty  was  among  the  protesting  delegates,
but  having  in  the  meantime  changed  his  name,  it  appears  on  the
supplementary  paragraph  as  "Iskagua.  or  Clear  Sky,  formerly

cipal  raiders  on  the  Tennessee  frontier,  the  new  name  may  have  been
symbolicof  bis  change  of  bear!  at  the  prospectof  a  return  of  peace.
The  treaty  seems  to  have  bad  little  effect  in  preventing  Indian  hos-
tilities, probabrj  because  the  intruders  still  remained  upon  the  Indian
lands,  and  raiding  still  continued.  The  Creeks  were  known  to  be
responsible  for  someof  the  mischief,  and  the  hostile  Chickamaugas
were  supposed  to  be  the  chief  authors  of  the  rest.1  Even  while  the
Cherokee  delegates  were  negotiating  the  treaty  in  Philadelphia  a  boat
which  had  accidentally  run  aground  on  the  Muscle  shoals  was  attacked
by  a  party  of  Indians  under  the  pretense  of  offering  assistance,  one
man  being  killed  and  another  severely  wounded  with  a  hatchet.'
While  these  negotiations  had  been  pending  at  Philadelphia  a  young-
man  named  Leonard  D.  Shaw,  a  student  at  Princeton  college,  had
expressed  to  the  Secretary  of  War  an  earnest  desire  lor  a  commission
which  would  enable  him  to  accompany  the  returning  Cherokee  dele-
gates to  their  southern  home,  there  to  study  Indian  life  and  charac-
teristics. As  the  purpose  seemed  a  useful  one.  and  he  appeared  well
qualified  tor  such  a  work,  he  was  accordingly  commissioned  as  deputy
agent  to  reside  among-  the  Cherokee  to  observe  and  report  upon  their
movements,  to  aid  in  the  annuity  distributions,  and  to  render  other
assistance  to  Governor  Blount,  superintendent  for  the  southern  tribes,
to  study  their  language  and  home  life,  and  to  collect  materials  for  an
Indian  history.  An  extract  from  the  official  instructions  under  which
this  first  Tinted  States  ethnologist  began  his  work  will  he  of  interest.

mile*  each  day,  and  that  you  would  reach  Holaton  in  about  thirty  days.'
The  journey,  which  seemed  then  so  long,  was  to  be  made  by  wagons
from  Philadelphia  to  the  head  of  navigation  on  Holston  fiver,  thence  by
boats  to  the  Cherokee  towns.  Shaw  seems  to  have  taken  up  his  resi-
dence at  Ustanali,  which  had  superseded  Echota  as  the  ( Iherokee  capital.
We  hear  of  him  as  present  at  a  council  there  in  June  of  the  same  year.
with  no  evidence  of  unfriendliness  at  his  presence."  The  friendly  feel-
ing was  of  short  continuance,  however,  for  a  few  months  later  we  find
him  writing  from  Ustanali  to  Governor  Blount  that  on  account  of  the
aggressive  hostility  of  the  Creeks,  whose  avowed  intention  was  to  kill
every  white  man  they  met,  he  was  not  safe  50  yards  front  the  house.
Soon  afterwards  the  Chickamauga  towns  again  declared  war,  on  which
account,  together  with  renewed  threats  by  the  ('recks,  he  was  advised
by  the  Cherokee  to  leave  Ustanali,  which  he  did  early  in  September,
1792,  proceeding  to  the  home  of  General  Pickens,  near  Seneca,  South
Carolina,  escorted  by  a  guard  of  friendly  Cherokee.  In  the  follow-
ing  winter  he  was  dismissed  front  the  service  on  serious  charges,  and
his  mission  appears  to  have  been  a  failure.3
To  prevent  an  alliance  of  the  Cherokee,  Creeks,  and  other  south-
ern Indians  with  the  confederated  hostile  northern  tribes,  the  govern-
ment had  endeavored  to  persuade  the  former  to  furnish  a  contingent
of  warriors  to  act  with  the  army  against  the  northern  Indians,  and
special  instruction  had  been  given  to  Shaw  to  use  his  efforts  for  this
result.  Nothing,  however,  came  of  the  attempt.  St  Clair's  defeat turned  the  scale  against  the  United  States,  and  in  September,  1792,
the  Chickamauga  towns  formally  declared  war.1
In  November  of  this  year  the  governor  of  Georgia  officially  reported
that  a  party  of  lawless  Georgians  had  gone  into  the  Cherokee  Nation,
and  had  there  burned  a  town  and  barbarously  killed  three  Indians,
while  about  the  same  time  two  other  Cherokee  had  been  killed  within
the  settlements.  Fearing  retaliation,  he  ordered  out  a  patrol  of  troops
to  guard  the  frontier  in  that  direction,  and  sent  a  conciliatory  letter  to
the  chiefs,  expressing  his  regret  for  what  had  happened.  No  answer
was  returned  to  the  message,  but  a  few  days  later  an  entire  family  was
found  murdered — four  women,  three  children,  and  a  young  man — all
scalped  and  mangled  and  witlt  arrows  sticking  in  the  bodies,  while,
according  to  old  Indian  war  custom,   two  war  clubs   were  left  upon

a  party  had  just  come  in  with  prisoners  and  some  fresh  scalps,  over

the  SI  ia\\  aiio  were  urging  the  Cherokee  to  join  them  against  the  Ameri-
cans; that  a  strong  body  of  Creeks  was  on  it-  way  against  the  Cum-
berland settlements,  and  that  the  ( 'reck  chief.  Met  rillivray,  was  trying to  form  a  general  confederacy  of  all  the  Indian  tribes  against  the
whites.  To  understand  this  properly  it  must  lie  remembered  that  at
this  time  all  the  tribes  northwest  of  the  Ohio  and  as  far  as  the  heads
of  the  Mississippi  were  banded  together  in  a  grand  alliance,  headed
l>\  the  warlike  Shawano,  for  the  purpose  of  holding  the  Ohio  river  as
the  Indian  boundary  against  the  advancing  tide  of  white  settlement.
They  had  just  cut  to  pieces  one  of  the  finest  armies  ever  sent  into  the
West,  under  the  veteran  General  St  Clair  (28),  and  it  seemed  for  the
moment  a-  if  the  American  advance  would  he  driven  hack  behind  the
Alleghenies.
In  the  emergency  the  Secretary  of  War  directed  Governor  Blount
to  hold  a  conference  with  the  chiefs  of  the  Chickasaw.  Choctaw,  and
Cherokee  at  Nashville  in  dune  to  enlist  their  warriors,  if  possible,  in
active  service  against  the  northern  tribes.  The  conference  was  held
as  proposed,  in  August,  but  nothing  seems  to  have  come  of  it,  although
the  child's  seemed  to  lie  sincere  in  their  assurances  of  friendship.
Very  few  of  the  Choctaw  or  Cherokee  were  in  attendance.  At  the
annuity  distribution  of  the  Cherokee,  shortly  before,  the  chiefs  had
also  been  profuse  in  declarations  of  their  desire  for  peace.'  Notwith- standing all  this  the  attacks  along  the  Tennessee  frontier  continued  to
such  an  extent  that  the  blockhouses  were  again  put  in  order  ami  gar-
risoned. Soon  afterwards  the  governor  reported  to  the  Secretary  of
War  that  the  five  lower  Cherokee  towns  on  the  Tennessee  (the  Chicka-
mauga), headed  by  John  Watts,  had  finally  declared  war  against  the
United  State-,  and  that  from  three  to  six  hundred  warriors,  including
a  hundred  Creeks,  had  started  against  the  settlements.  The  militia
was  at  once  called  out.  both  in  eastern  Tennessee  and  on  the  Cumber-
land. On  the  Cumberland  side  it  was  directed  that  no  pursuit  should
he  continued  beyond  the  Cherokee  boundary,  the  ridge  between  the
waters  of  Cumberland  and  Duck  rivers.  The  order  issued  by  Colonel
White,  of  Knox  county,  to  each  of  his  captains  shows  how  great  was
the  alarm:

mooney]  ATTACK    ON     BUCHANAN'S    STATION  —  L792  73
Knoxville,  September  n.  1792.
Sir:  You  arc  hereby  commanded   to    repair  with   your  company  to  Knoxville,
equipped,  to  protect  the  frontiers;  there  is  imminent  danger.     Bring  with  you  two
days'  provisions,  if  possible;  but  you  are  not  to  delay  an  hour  on  that  head.
I  am.  sir.  yours,
James  White.1
About  midnight  on  the  30th  of  September,  1792,  the  Indian  force,
consisting  of  several  hundred  Chickamaugas  and  other  Cherokee,
("reeks,  and  Shawano,  attacked  Buchanan's  station,  a  few  miles  south
of  Nashville.  Although  numbers  of  families  had  collected  inside  the
stockade  for  safety,  there  were  less  than  twenty  able-bodied  men
among  them.  The  approach  of  the  enemy  alarmed  the  cattle,  by
which  the  garrison  had  warning  just  in  time  to  close  the  gate  when
the  Indians  were  already  within  a  few  yards  of  the  entrance.  The
assault  wtis  furious  and  determined,  the  Indians  rushing  up  to  the
stockade,  attempting  to  set  tire  to  it.  and  aiming  their  guns  through
the  port  holes.  One  Indian  succeeded  in  climbing  upon  the  roof  with
a  lighted  torch,  but  was  shot  and  fell  to  the  ground,  holding  his  torch
against  the  logs  as  he  drew  his  last  breath.  It  was  learned  afterward
that  he  was  a  half  blood,  the  stepson  of  the  old  white  trader  who  had
once  rescued  the  boy  Joseph  Brown  at  Nickajack.  He  was  a  desperate
warrior  and  when  only  twenty-two  years  of  age  had  already  taken  six
white  scalps.  The  attack  was  repulsed  at  every  point,  and  the  assail
ants  finally  drew  off,  with  considerable  loss,  carrying  their  dead  and
wounded  with  them,  and  leaving  a  number  of  hatchets,  pipes,  and  other
spoils  upon  the  ground.  Among  the  wounded  was  the  chief  John
Watts.  Not  one  of  those  in  the  fort  was  injured.  It  has  been  well
said  that  the  defense  of  Buchanan's  station  by  such  a  handful  of  men against  an  attacking  force  estimated  all  the  way  at  from  three  to  seven
hundred  Indians  is  a  feat  of  bravery  which  has  scarcely  been  surpassed
in  the  annals  of  border  warfare.  The  effect  upon  the  Indians  must
have  been  thoroughly  disheartening.2
In  the  same  month  arrangements  were  made  for  protecting  the  fron-
tier along  the  French  Broad  by  means  of  a  series  of  garrisoned  block-
houses, with  scouts  to  patrol  regularly  from  one  to  another.  North
Carolina  cooperating  on  her  side  of  the  line.  The  hostile  inroads  still
continued  in  this  section,  the  Creeks  acting  with  the  hostile  Cherokee.
One  raiding  party  of  Creeks  having  been  traced  toward  Chilhowee
town  on  Little  Tennessee,  the  whites  were  about  to  burn  that  and  a
neighboring  Cherokee  town  when  Sevier  interposed  and  prevented.3
There  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  people  of  these  towns  were
directly  concerned  in  the  depredations  along  the  frontier  at  this  period,

the  mischief  I >< ■  i 1 1  <j-  done  by  those  farther  to  the  south,  in  conjunction with  the  ( ireeks.
Toward  the  close  of  this  year,  L792,  Captain  Samuel  Handley,  while
leading  ;i  small  party  of  men  to  reenforce  the  ( Cumberland  settlement,
was  attacked  by  a  mixed  force  of  Cherokee,  Creeks,  and  Shawano,
near  the  Grab  Orchard,  west  of  the  presenl  Kingston,  Tennessee.
Becoming  separated  from  his  men  he  encountered  a  warrior  who  had
lifted  his  hatchet  to  >trikc  when  Handley  seized  the  weapon,  crying
out  "Canaly"  (for  higtona'lii),  "friend,"  to  which  the  Cherokee
responded  with  tin'  same  word,  at  oner  lowering  his  arm.  Handley
was  carried  to  Willstown,  in  Alabama,  where  he  was  adopted  into  the
Wolf  elan  (29)  and  remained  until  the  next  spring.  After  having
made  use  of  his  services  in  writing  a  peace  letter  to  Governor  Blount
the  Cherokee  finally  sent  him  home  in  safety  to  his  friends  under  a
protecting  escort  of  eight  warriors,  without  any  demand  for  ransom.
He  afterward  resided  near  Tellico  blockhouse,  near  Loudon,  where,
after  the  wars  were  over,  his  Indian  friends  frequently  came  to  visit
and  stop  with  him.1
The  year  1T'.»H  began  with  a  series  of  attacks  all  along  the  Tennes-
see frontier.  As  before,  most  of  the  depredation  was  by  Chicka-
maugas  and  Creeks,  with  some  stray  Shawano  from  the  north.  The
Cherokee  from  the  towns  on  Little  Tennessee  remained  peaceable,  but
their  temper  was  sorely  tried  by  a  regrettable  circumstance  which
occurred  in  June.  While  a  number  of  friendly  chiefs  were  assembled
for  a  conference  at  Echota,  on  the  express  request  of  the  President,
a  party  of  men  under  command  of  a  Captain  John  Beard  sud-
denly attacked  them,  killing  about  fifteen  Indians,  including  several
chiefs  and  two  women,  one  of  them  being  the  wife  of  Hanging-maw
(Ushwa'li-guta),  principal  chief  of  the  Nation,  who  was  himself
wounded.  The  murderers  then  tied,  leaving  others  to  suffer  the  conse-
quences. Two  hundred  warriors  at  once  took  up  arms  to  revenge  their
loss,  and  only  the  most  earnest  appeal  from  the  deputy  governor  could
lest  rain  them  from  swift  retaliation.  While  the  chief ,  whose  wife
was  thus  murdered  and  himself  wounded,  forebore  to  revenge  himself,
in  order  not  to  bring  war  upon  his  people,  the  Secretary  of  War  was
obliged  to  report.  "  to  my  great  pain,  I  find  to  punish  Beard  by  law  just
now  is  out  of  the  question."  Beard  was  in  fact  arrested,  but  the  trial
was  a  farce  and  he  was  acquitted.8
Believing  that  the  Cherokee  Nation,  with  the  exception  of  the
Chickamaugas,  was  honestly  trying  to  preserve  peace,  the  territorial
government,  while  making  provision  for  the  safety  of  the  exposed
settlements,  had  strictly  prohibited  any  invasion  of  the  Indian  country.
The  frontier  people  were  of  a  different  opinion,  and  in  spite  of  the
prohibition  a   company  of  nearly  two  hundred  mounted  men   under

moosey]  MASSACRE    AT    CAVITTS    STATION   1793  75
Colonels  Doherty  and  McFarland  crossed  over  the  mountains  in  the
summer  of  this  year  and  destroyed  six  of  the  middle  towns,  returning
with  fifteen  scalps  and  as  many  prisoners.'
Late  in  September  a  strong  force  estimated  at  one  thousand  war-
riors— seven  hundred  Creeks  and  three  hundred  Cherokee — under  John
Watts  and  Doublehead,  crossed  the  Tennessee  and  advanced  in  the
direction  of  Knoxville.  where  the  public  stores  were  then  deposited.
In  their  eagerness  to  reach  Knoxville  they  passed  quietly  by  one  or
two  smaller  settlements  until  within  a  short  distance  of  the  town,  when,
at  daybreak  of  the  25th,  they  heard  the  garrison  tire  the  sunrise  gun
and  imagined  that  they  were  discovered.  Differences  had  already
broken  out  among  the  leaders,  and  without  venturing  to  advance
farther  they  contented  themselves  with  an  attack  upon  a  small  block-
house a  few  miles  to  the  west,  known  as  Cavitts  station,  in  which  at
the  time  were  only  three  men  with  thirteen  women  and  children.
After  defending  themselves  bravely  for  some  time  these  surrendered
on  promise  that  they  should  be  held  for  exchange,  but  as  soon  as  they
came  out  Doublehead's  warriors  fell  upon  them  and  put  them  all  to
death  with  the  exception  of  a  boy,  who  was  saved  by  John  Watts.
This  bloody  deed  was  entirely  the  work  of  Doublehead.  the  other
chiefs  having  done  their  best  to  prevent  it.2
A  force  of  seven  hundred  men  under  General  Sevier  wasat  once  put
upon  their  track,  with  orders  this  time  to  push  the  pursuit  into  the
heart  of  the  Indian  nation.  Crossing  Little  Tennessee  and  Hiwassee
they  penetrated  to  Ustanali  town,  near  the  present  Calhoun,  Georgia.
Finding  it  deserted,  although  well  tilled  with  provision,  they
rested  there  a  few  days,  the  Indians  in  the  meantime  attempting
a  night  attack  without  success.  After  burning  the  town.  Sevier  con-
tinued down  the  river  to  Etowah  town,  near  the  present  site  of  Rome.
Here  the  Indians— Cherokee  and  Creeks — had  dug  intrenchments  and
prepared  to  make  a  stand,  but,  being  outflanked,  were  defeated  with
loss  and  compelled  to  retreat.  This  town,  with  several  others  in  the
neighborhood  belonging  to  both  Cherokee  and  Creeks,  w-as  destroyed,
with  all  the  provision  of  the  Indians,  including  three  hundred  cattle,
after  which  the  army  took  up  the  homeward  march.  The  Americans
had  lost  but  three  men.     This  was  the  last  military  service  of  Sevier.3
During  the  absence  of  Sevier's  force  in  the  south  the  Indians  made a  sudden  inroad  on  the  French  Broad,  near  the  present  Dandridge,
killing  and  scalping  a  woman  and  a  boy.  While  their  friends  were
accompanying  the  remains  to  a  neighboring  burial  ground  for  "inter- ment, two  men  who  had  incautiously  gone  ahead  were  tired  upon.     One

of  them  escaped,  but  the  other  one  was  fouud  killed  and  scalped  when
the  resl  of  thecompany  came  up,  and  was  buried  with  the  first  victims..
Sevier's  success  brought  temporary  respite  to  the  Cumberland  settle-
ments. During  the  early  part  of  the  year  the  Indian  attacks  by
small  raiding  parties  had  been  so  frequent  and  annoying  that  a  force
of  men  had  been  kept  out  on  patrol  service  under  officers  who  adopted
with  some  success  the  policy  of  hunting  the  Indian-  in  their  camping
places  in  the  thickets,  rather  than  waiting  for  them  to  come  i n t < .  the
settlements.'
In  February,  1  T'.*4.  the  Territorial  assembly  of  Tennessee  met  at
Knoxvillc  and.  among  other  business  transacted,  addressed  a  strong
memorial  to  Congress  calling  for  mure  efficient  protection  for  the
frontier  and  demanding  a  declaration  of  war  against  the  Creeks  and
Cherokee.  The  memorial  states  that  since  the  treaty  of  Eiolston  (July,
L791),  these  two  tribes  bad  killed  in  a  most  barbarous  and  inhuman
manner  more  than  two  hundred  citizens  of  Tennessee,  of  both  sexes.
had  carried  others  into  captivity,  destroyed  their  stock,  burned
their  houses,  and  laid  waste  their  plantations,  had  robbed  the  citizens
of  their  slaves  and  stolen  at  least  two  thousand  horses.  Special  atten-
tion was  directed  to  the  two  great  invasion-  in  September,  17'.':.'.  and
September,  1793,  and  the  memorialists  declare  that  there  was  scarcely
a  man  of  the  assembly  hut  could  tell  of  "a  dear  wife  or  child,  an  aged
parent  or  near  relation,  besides  friends,  massacred  by  the  hands  of  these
bloodthirsty  nations  in  their  house  or  fields."8
In  the  meantime  the  raids  continued  and  every  scattered  cabin  was  a
target  for  attack.  In  April  a  party  of  twenty  warriors  surrounded
the  house  of  a  man  named  Casteel  on  the  French  Broad  about  nine
miles  above  Knoxville  and  massacred  father,  mother,  and  four  children
in  most  brutal  fashion.  One  child  only  was  left  alive,  a  girl  of  ten
years,  who  was  found  scalped  and  bleeding  from  six  tomahawk  gashes,
vet  survived.  The  others  were  buried  in  one  grave.  The  massacre
roused  such  a  storm  of  excitement  that  it  required  all  the  effort
of  the  governor  and  the  local  officials  to  prevent  an  invasion  in  force
of  the  Indian  country.  Tt  was  learned  that  Doublehead.  of  the  Chicka-
mauga  towns,  was  trying  to  get  the  support  of  the  valley  towns,  which,
however,  continued  to  maintain  an  attitude  of  peace.  The  friendly
Cherokee  also  declared  that  the  Spaniards  were  constantly  instigating
the  lower  tow  ns  to  hostilities,  although  John  Watts,  one  of  their  prin-
cipal chiefs,  advocated  peace. '
In  June  a  boat  under  command  of  William  Scott,  laden  with  pot-,
hardware,  and  other  property,  and  containing  six  white  men.  three
women,  four  children,  and  twenty  negroes,  left  Knoxville  to  descend

Tennessee  river  to  Natchez.  As  it  passed  the  Chickamauga  towns  it
was  fired  upon  from  Running  Water  and  Long  island  without  damage
The  whites  returned  the  tire,  wounding  two  Indians.  A  large  party  of
Cherokee,  headed  by  White-man-killer  (Une'ga-dihi").  then  started  in
pursuit  of  the  boat,  which  they  overtook  at  Muscle  shoals,  where  they
killed  all  the  white  people  in  it.  made  prisoners  of  the  negroes,  an. I
plundered  the  goods.  Three  Indians  were  killed  and  one  was  wounded
in  the  action.1  It  is  said  that  the  Indian  actors  in  this  massacre  tied
across  the  Mississippi  into  Spanish  territory  and  became  the  nucleus  of
the  Cherokee  Nation  of  the  West,  as  will  be  noted  elsewhere.
On  June  26,  1794,  another  treaty,  intended  to  be  supplementary  to
that  of  Holston  in  1791,  was  negotiated  at  Philadelphia,  being  signed
by  the  Secretary  of  War  and  by  thirteen  principal  men  of  the  Chero-
kee. An  arrangement  was  made  for  the  proper  marking  of  the
boundary  then  established,  and  the  annuity  was  increased  to  five
thousand  dollars,  with  a  proviso  that  fifty  dollars  were  to  be  deducted
for  every  horse  -tolen  by  the  Cherokee  and  not  restored  within  three
months.2
In  July  a  man  named  John  Ish  was  shot  down  while  plowing  in  his
field  eighteen  miles  below  Knoxville.  By  order  of  Hanging-maw,  the
friendly  chief  of  Echota,  a  party  of  Cherokee  took  the  trail  and  cap-
tured the  murderer,  who  proved  to  be  a  Creek,  whom  they  brought
in  to  the  agent  at  Tellico  blockhouse,  where  he  was  formally  tried
and  hanged.  When  asked  the  usual  question  he  said  that  his  people
were  at  war  with  the  whites,  that  he  had  left  home  to  kill  or  be  killed.
that  he  had  killed  the  white  man  and  would  have  escaped  but  for  the
Cherokee,  and  that  there  were  enough  of  his  nation  to  avenge  his
death.  A  few  days  later  a  party  of  one  hundred  Creek  warriors
crossed  Tennessee  river  against  the  settlements.  The  alarm  was  given
by  Hanging-maw.  and  fifty-three  Cherokee  with  a  few  federal  troops
started  in  pursuit.  On  the  loth  of  August  they  came  up  with  the
Creeks,  killing  one  and  wounding  another,  one  Cherokee  being  slightly
wounded.  The  Creeks  retreated  and  the  victors  returned  to  the
Cherokee  towns,  where  their  return  was  announced  by  the  death  song
and  the  tiring  of  guns.  "The  night  was  spent  in  dancing  the  scalp
dance,  according  to  the  custom  of  warriors  after  a  victory  over  their
enemies,  in  which  the  white  and  red  people  heartily  joined.  The
Upper  Cherokee  had  now  stepped  too  far  to  go  back,  and  their  pro-
fessions of  friendship  were  now  no  longer  to  be  questioned."  In  the
same  month  there  was  an  engagement  between  a  detachment  of  about

forty  soldiers  and  a  large  body  of  Creeks  near  ('rah  ( >rchard,  in  which
several  of  each  were  killed.1  It  is  evident  that  much  of  the  damage
on  hnth  sides  <>t'  the  Cumberland  range  was  due  to  the  Creeks.
In  the  meantime  Governor  Blount  was  trying  to  negotiate  peace
with  tin'  whole  Cherokee  Nation,  but  with  little  success.  The  Cher-
okee claimed  to  he  anxious  for  permanent  peace,  hut  said  thai  it  was
impossible  to  restore  the  property  taken  by  them,  as  it  had  been  taken
in  war,  and  they  had  themselves  been  equal  losers  from  the  white-.
They  said   also    that    they  COuld    not    prevent    the   hostile  Creeks  from
passing  through  their  territory.  About  the  end  of  July  it  was  learned
that  a  strong  body  of  ('reeks  had  started  north  against  the  settlements.
The  militia  was  at  once  ordered  out  alone-  the  Tennessee  frontier,  and
the  friendly  Cherokees  offered  their  services,  while  measures  were
taken  to  protect  their  women  and  children  from  the  enemy.  The
( 'reeks  advanced  as  far  as  Willstown,  when  the  news  came  of  the  com-
plete defeat  of  the  confederated  northern  tribes  by  General  Wayne
(30),  and  fearing  the  same  fate  for  themselves,  they  turned  back  and
scattered  to  their  towns. -
The  Tennesseeans.  especially  those  on  the  Cumberland,  had  lone-  ago
come  to  the  conclusion  that  peace  could  he  brought  about  only  through
the  destruction  of  the Chickamauga  towns.  Anticipating  some  action
of  this  kind,  which  the  general  government  did  not  think  necessary  or
advisable,  orders  against  any  such  attempt  had  been  issued  by  the
Secretary  of  War  to  Governor  Blount.  The  frontier  people  went
about  their  preparations,  however,  and  it  is  evident  from  the  result
that  the  local  military  authorities  were  in  connivance  with  the  under-
taking. General  Robertson  was  the  chief  organizer  of  the  volunteers
about  Nashville,  who  were  reenforced  by  a  company  id'  Kentuckians under  Colonel  Whitley.  Major  Ore  had  been  sent  by  Governor
Blount  with  a  detachment  of  troops  to  protect  the  Cumberland  settle-
ments, and  on  arriving  at  Nashville  entered  as  heartily  into  the  project
as  if  no  counter  orders  had  ever  been  issued,  and  was  given  chief  com-
mand of  the  expedition,  which  for  this  reason  is  commonly  known  as
■•(  he's  expedition."
<  )n  September  7.  L794,  the  army  of  five  hundred  and  fifty  mounted
men  left  Nashville,  and  five  days  later  crossed  the  Tennessee  near  the
mouth  of  the  Sequatchee  river,  their  guide  being  the  same  Joseph
Brown  of  whom  the  old  Indian  woman  had  said  that  he  would  one  day
bring  the  soldiers  to  destroy  them.  Having  left  their  horses  on  the
other  side  of  the  river,  they  moved  up  along  the  south  hank  just  after
daybreak  of  the  L3th  and  surprised  the  town  of  Nickajack,  killing
several  warriors  and  taking  a  Dumber  of  prisoners.  Some  who
attempted   to  escape   in  canoes  were  shot  in  the  water.      The  warriors

iii  Running  Water  town,  four  miles  above,  heard  the  firing  and  came
at  once  to  the  assistance  of  their  friends,  but  wen1  driven  back  after
attempting  to  hold  their  ground,  and  the  second  town  shared  the  fate
of  the  first.  More  than  fifty  Indians  had  been  killed,  a  number  were
prisoners,  both  towns  and  all  their  contents  had  been  destroyed,  with
a  loss  to  the  assailants  of  only  three  men  wounded.  The  Breath,  the
chief  of  Running  Water,  was  among  those  killed.  Two  fresh  scalps
with  a  large  quantity  of  plunder  from  the  settlements  were  found  in
the  towns,  together  with  a  supply  of  ammunition  said  to  have  been
furnished  by  the  Spaniards.1
Soon  after  the  return  of  the  expedition  Robertson  sent  a  message  to
John  Watts,  the  principal  leader  of  the  hostile  Cherokee,  threatening
a  second  visitation  if  the  Indians  did  not  very  soon  surrender  their
prisoners  and  give  assurances  of  peace.2  The  destruction  of  their towns  on  Tennessee  and  Coosa  and  the  utter  defeat  of  the  northern
confederates  had  now  broken  the  courage  of  the  Cherokee,  and  on  their
own  request  Governor  Blount  held  a  conference  with  them  at  Tellico
blockhouse,  November  7  and  8,  1794,  at  which  Hanging-maw,  head
chief  of  the  Nation,  and  Colonel  John  Watt,  principal  chief  of  the  hos-
tile towns,  with  about  four  hundred  of  their  warriors,  attended.  The
result  was  satisfactory;  all  differences  were  arranged  on  a  friendly
basis  and  the  long  Cherokee  war  came  to  an  end.3
Owing  to  the  continued  devastation  of  their  towns  during  the  Rev-
olutionary struggle,  a  number  of  Cherokee,  principally  of  the  Chicka-
mauga  band,  had  removed  across  the  Ohio  about  1782  and  settled  on
Paint  creek,  a  branch  of  the  Scioto  river,  in  the  vicinity  of  their
friends  and  allies,  the  Shawano.  In  17*7  they  were  reported  to  num-
ber about  seventy  warriors.  They  took  an  active  part  in  the  hostili-
ties along  the  Ohio  frontier  and  were  present  in  the  great  battle  at  the
Maumee  rapids,  by  which  the  power  of  the  confederated  northern  tribes
was  effectually  broken.  As  they  had  failed  to  attend  the  treaty  con-
ference held  at  Greenville  in  August,  1795,  General  Wayne  sent  them
a  special  message,  through  their  chief  Long-hair,  that  if  they  refused
to  come  in  and  make  terms  as  the  others  had  done  they  would  be  con-
sidered outside  the  protection  of  the  government.  Upon  this  a  part
of  them  came  in  and  promised  that  as  soon  as  they  could  gather  their
crops  the  wThole  band  would  leave  Ohio  forever  and  return  to  their
people  in  the  south.4

80  MYTHS    OF    THE    CHEROKEE  [eth.akn.19
The  Creeks  were  -till  hostile  and  continued  their  inroads  upon  the
western  settlements.  Early  in  January,  17'.i.">.  Governor  Blount  held
another  conference  with  the  Cherokee  and  endeavored  t"  persuade
them  i"  organise  a  company  of  their  young  men  to  patrol  the  frontier
against  the  Creeks,  but  to  this  proposal  the  chiefs  refused  to  consent.1
In  the  next  year  it  was  discovered  that  a  movement  was  on  foot  to
take  possession  of  certain  Indian  lands  south  of  the  Cumberland  on
pretense  of  authority  formerly  granted  by  North  Carolina  for  the
relief  of  Revolutionary  soldiers.  As  such  action  would  almost  surely
have  resulted  in  another  Indian  war.  Congress  interposed,  on  the  rep-
resentation of  President  Washington,  with  an  act  for  the  regulation  of
intercourse  between  citizens  of  the  United  States  and  the  various
Indian  tribes.  Its  main  purpose  was  to  prevent  intrusion  upon  lands
to  which  the  Indian  title  had  not  been  extinguished  by  treaty  with  the
general  government,  and  under  its  provisions  a  number  of  squatters
were  ejected  from  the  Indian  country  and  removed  across  the  boundary.
The  pressure  of  border  sentiment,  however,  was  constantly  for  extend-
ing the  area  of  white  settlement  and  the  result  was  an  immediate  agita-
tion to  procure  another  treaty  cession. :
In  consequence  of  urgent  representations  from  the  people  of  Ten-
nessee, Congress  took  steps  in  IT'.tT  for  procuring  a  new  treaty  with
the  Cherokee  by  which  the  ejected  settlers  might  '»■  reinstated  and  the
boundaries  of  the  new  state  so  extended  as  to  bring  about  closer  com-
munication between  the  eastern  settlements  and  those  on  the  ( lumber-
land.  Tin1  Revolutionary  warfare  had  forced  the  Cherokee  west  and
south,  and  their  capital  and  central  gathering  place  was  now  Ustanali
town,  near  the  present  Calhoun.  Georgia,  while  Echota,  their  ancient
capital  and  beloved  peace  town,  was  almost  on  the  edge  of  the  white
settlements.  The  commissioners  wished  to  have  the  proceedings  con-
ducted at  Echota,  while  the  Cherokee  favored  Ustanali.  After  some
debate  a  choice  was  made  of  a  convenient  place  near  Tellico  block-
house, where  the  conference  opened  in  July,  hut  was  brought  to  an
abrupt  (dose  by  the  peremptory  refusal  of  the  Cherokee  to  sell  any
land-  or  to  permit  the  return  of  the  ejected  settlers.
The  rest  of  the  summer  was  spent  in  negotiation  alone'  the  linos
already  proposed,  and  on  October  2,  L798,  a  treaty,  commonly  known
as  the  "first  treaty  of  Tellico."  was  concluded*at  the  same  place,  and
was  signed  by  thirty-nine  chiefs  on  behalf  of  the  Cherokee.  By  this
t  reaty  the  Indians  ceded  a  tract  between  ( !linch  river  and  the  Cumber-
land ridge,  another  alone-  the  northern  hank  of  Little  Tennessee
extending  up  to  Chilhowee  mountain,  and  a  third  in  North  Carolina  mi

of  the  present  Waynesville  and  Hendersonville.  These  cessions
included  most  or  all  of  the  lands  from  which  settlers  had  been  ejected.
Permission  was  also  given  for  laying  out  the  "Cumberland  road."  to connect  the  east  Tennessee  settlements  with  those  about  Nashville.  In
consideration  of  the  lands  and  rights  surrendered,  the  United  States
agreed  to  deliver  to  the  Cherokee  five  thousand  dollars  in  goods,  and
to  increase  their  existing  annuity  by  one  thousand  dollars,  and  as  usual,
to  •■continue  the  guarantee  of  the  remainder  of  their  country  forever."'
Wayne's  victory  over  the  northern  tribes  at  the  battle  of  the  Mau-
niee  rapids  completely  broke  their  power  and  compelled  them  to  accept
the  terms  of  peace  dictated  at  the  treaty  of  Greenville  in  the  summer
of  1795.  The  immediate  result  was  the  surrender  of  the  Ohio  river
boundary  by  the  Indians  and  the  withdrawal  of  the  British  garrisons
from  the  interior  posts,  which  up  to  this  time  they  had  continued  to
hold  in  spite  of  the  treaty  made  at  the  close  of  the  Revolution.  By
the  treaty  made  at  Madrid  in  October,  L795,  Spain  gave  up  all  claim
on  the  east  side  of  the  Mississippi  north  of  the  thirty-first  parallel,  but
on  various  pretexts  the  formal  transfer  of  posts  was  delayed  and  a
Spanish  garrison  continued  to  occupy  San  Fernando  de  Barrancas,  at
the  present  Memphis.  Tennessee,  until  the  fall  of  1797,  while  that  at
Natchez,  in  Mississippi,  was  not  surrendered  until  March.  1798.  The
Creeks,  seeing  the  trend  of  affairs,  had  made  peace  at  Colerain.
Georgia,  in  June,  179t>.  With  the  hostile  European  influence  thus
eliminated,  at  least  for  the  time,  the  warlike  tribes  on  the  north  and
on  the  south  crushed  and  dispirited  and  the  Chickamauga  towns  wiped
out  of  existence,  the  Cherokee  realized  that  they  must  accept  the
situation  and,  after  nearly  twenty  years  of  continuous  warfare,  laid  \^
aside  the  tomahawk  to  cultivate  the  arts  of  peace  and  civilization.
The  close  of  the  century  found  them  still  a  compact  people  (the
westward  movement  having  hardly  yet  begun)  numbering  probably
about  20,000  souls.  After  repeated  cessions  of  large  tracts  of  land,  to
some  of  which  they  had  but  doubtful  claim,  they  remained  in  recog-
nized possession  of  nearly  4:3,000  square  miles  of  territory,  a  country
about  equal  in  extent  to  Ohio.  Virginia,  or  Tennessee.  Of  this 'terri- tory about  one  half  was  within  the  limits  of  Tennessee,  the  remainder
being  almost  equally  divided  between  Georgia  and  Alabama,  with  a
small  area  in  the  extreme  southwestern  corner  of  North  Carolina.2
The  old  Lower  towns  on  Savannah  river  had  been  broken  up  for
twenty  years,  and  the  whites  had  so  far  encroached  upon  the  Upper
towns  that  the  capital  and  council  tire  of  the  nation  had  been  removed
from  the  ancient  peace  town  of  Echota  to  Ustanali,  in  Georgia.     The

towns  on  Coosa  river  and  in  Alabama  were  almost  all  of  recent  estab-
lishment, peopled  by  refugees  from  the  east  and  north.  The  Middle
towns,  in  North  Carolina,  were  still  surrounded  by  Indian  country.
Firearms  had  been  introduced  into  the  tribe  about  one  hundred
years  before,  and  the  Cherokee  had  learned  well  their  use.  Such
civilized  goods  as  hatchets,  knives,  clothes,  and  trinkets  had  become
so  common  before  the  first  Cherokee  war  that  the  Indians  had  declared
that  they  could  no  longer  live  without  the  trader-.  Horses  and  other
domestic  animals  had  been  introduced  early  in  the  century,  and  at  the
opening  of  the  war  of  L760,  according  to  Adair,  the  Cherokee  had  "a
prodigious  number  of  excellent  horses."  and  although  hunger  had compelled  them  t<>  eat  a  great  many  of  these  during  that  period,  they
still  had,  in  1775.  from  two  to  a  dozen  each,  and  bid  fair  soon  to  have
plenty  of  the  best  sort,  as,  according  to  the  same  authority,  they  were
skilful  jockeys  and  nice  in  their  choice.  Some  of  them  had  grown
fond  of  cattle,  and  they  had  also  an  abundance  of  hoes  and  poultry,
the  Indian  pork  being  esteemed  better  than  that  raised  in  the  white
settlements  on  account  of  the  chestnut  diet.1  In  Sevier's  expedition
against  the  towns  on  Coosa  river,  in  1793,  the  army  killed  three  hun-
dred beeves  at  Etowah  and  left  their  carcasses  rotting  on  the  ground.
While  crossing  the  Cherokee  country  in  1796  Hawkins  met  an  Indian
woman  on  horseback  driving  ten  very  fat  cattle  to  the  settlements  for
sale.  Peach  trees  and  potatoes,  as  well  as  the  native  corn  and  beans,
were  abundant  in  their  fields,  and  some  had  bees  and  honey  and  did  a
considerable  trade  in  beeswax.  They  seem  to  have  quickly  recovered
from  the  repeated  ravages  of  war.  and  there  was  a  general  air  of  pros-
perity throughout  the  nation.  The  native  arts  ()f  pottery  and  basket-
making  were  still  the  principal  employment  of  the  women,  and  the
warriors  hunted  with  such  success  that  a  party  of  traders  brought
down  thirty  wagon  loads  of  skins  on  one  trip."  In  dress  and  house-
building the  Indian  style  was  practically  unchanged.
In  pursuance  of  a  civilizing  policy,  the  government  had  agreed,  by
the  treaty  of  17U1,  to  furnish  the  Cherokee  gratuitously  with  farming
tools  and  similar  assistance.  This  policy  was  continued  and  broadened
to  such  an  extent  that  in  L801  Hawkins  reports  that  "in  the  Cherokee
agency,  the  wheel,  the  loom,  and  the  plough  is  [sic]  in  pretty  general
use.  farming,  manufactures,  and  stock  raising  the  topic  of  conversation
among  the  men  and  women."  At  a  conference  held  this  year  we  find the  chiefs  of  the  mountain  towns  complaining  that  the  people  of  the
more  western  and  southwestern  settlements  had  received  more  than
their  share  of  spinning  wheels  and  cards,  and  were  consequently  more
advanced  in  making  their  own  clothing  as  well  as  in  farming,  to  which

the  others  retorted  that  these  things  had  been  offered  to  all  alike  at
the  same  time,  but  while  the  lowland  people  had  been  quick  to  accept,
the  mountaineers  had  hung  back.  "Those  who  complain  came  in  late.
We  have  got  the  start  of  them,  which  we  are  determined  to  keep."
The  progressives,  under  John  Watts,  Doublehead.  and  Will,  threatened
to  secede  from  the  rest  and  leave  those  east  of  Chilhowee  mountain  to
shift  for  themselves.1  We  see  here  the  germ  of  dissatisfaction  which
led  ultimately  to  the  emigration  of  the  western  band.  Along  with
other  things  of  civilization,  negro  slavery  had  been  introduced  and
several  of  the  leading  men  were  now  slaveholders  (31).
Much  of  the  advance  in  civilization  had  been  due  to  the  intermar-
riage among  them  of  white  men,  chiefly  traders  of  the  ante-Revolu-
tionary period,  with  a  few  Americans  from  the  back  settlements.  The
families  that  have  made  Cherokee  history  were  nearly  all  of  this  mixed
descent.  The  Doughertys,  Galpins.  and  Adairs  were  from  Ireland:  the
Rosses,  Vanns,  and  Macintoshes,  like  the  McGillivrays  and  Graysons
among  the  Creeks,  were  of  Scottish  origin;  the  Waffords  and  others
were  Americans  from  Carolina  or  Georgia,  and  the  father  of  Sequoya
was  a  (Pennsylvania '.)  German.  Most  of  this  white  blood  was  of  good
stock,  very  different  from  the  "squaw  man"  element  of  the  western tribes.  Those  of  the  mixed  blood  who  could  afford  it  usually  sent  their
children  away  to  be  educated,  while  some  built  schoolhouses  upon
their  own  grounds  and  brought  in  private  teachers  from  the  outside.
With  the  beginning  of  the  present  century  we  find  influential  mixed
bloods  in  almost  every  town,  and  the  civilized  idea  dominated  even  the
national  councils.  The  Middle  towns,  shut  in  from  the  outside  world
by  high  mountains,  remained  a  stronghold  of  Cherokee  conservatism.
With  the  exception  of  Priber,  there  seems  to  be  no  authentic  record
of  any  missionary  worker  among  the  Cherokee  before  1800.  There  is,
indeed,  an  incidental  notice  of  a  Presbyterian  minister  of  North  Caro-
lina being  on  his  way  to  the  tribe  in  1758,  but  nothing  seems  to  have
come  of  it,  and  we  find  him  soon  after  in  South  Carolina  and  separated
from  his  original  jurisdiction.2  The  first  permanent  mission  was  estab-
lished by  the  Moravians,  those  peaceful  German  immigrants  whose
teachings  were  so  well  exemplified  in  the  lives  of  Zeisberger  and
Heckewelder.  As  early  as  1734,  while  temporarily  settled  in  Georgia,
they  had  striven  to  bring  some  knowledge  of  the  Christian  religion  to
the  Indians  immediately  about  Savannah,  including  perhaps  some
stray  Cherokee.  Later  on  they  established  missions  among  the  Dela-
wares  in  Ohio,  where  their  first  Cherokee  convert  was  received  in
1773,  being  one  who  had  been  captured  by  the  Delawares  when  a
boy  and  had  grown  up  and  married  in  the  tribe.  In  1752  they  had
formed  a  settlement  on  the  upper  Yadkin,  near  the  present  Salem,

M  MYTHS    OF    THE    CHEROKEE  lbth.akh.1S
North  Carolina,  where  1 1  n - \  made  friendly  acquaintance  with  the
Cherokee.1  In  L799,  hearing  thai  the  Cherokee  desired  teachers  or
perhaps  bj  direct  invitation  of  the  chiefs  two  missionaries  visited
the  tribe  to  investigate  the  matter.  Another  visit  wa-  made  in  the
next  summer,  and  a  council  was  held  at  Tellico  agency,  where,  after  a
debate  in  which  the  Indians  showed  considerable  difference  <>t'  opinion, it  was  decided  tn  open  a  mission.  Permission  having  been  obtained
from  the  government,  the  work  was  begun  in  April.  L801,  by  Rev.
Abraham  Steiner  and  Rev.  Gottlieb  Byhan  at  the  residence  of  David
Vann,  a  prominent  mixed-blood  chief,  who  lodged  them  in  his  own
bouse  and  gave  them  every  assistance  in  building  the  mission,  which
they  afterward  called  Spring  place,  where  now  is  the  village  of  the
same  name  in  Murray  county,  northwestern  Georgia.  They  were
also  materially  aided  by  the  agent,  Colonel  Return  J.  Meigs  (32).  It
was  soon  seen  that  the  Cherokee  wanted  civilizers  for  their  children,
and  not    new  theologies,  and  when  they  found  that  a  school  could  not
at   once   1   pened   the  great   council  at   I'stanali  sent  orders  to  the
missi   iries  to  organize  a  school  within  six  months  or  leave  the  nation.
Through  Vann's  help  the  matter  was  arranged  and  a  school  was
opened,  several  sons  of  prominent  chiefs  being  among  the  pupils.
Another  Moravian  mission  was  established  by  Reverend  .1.  Gambold
at  Oothcaloga,  in  the  same  county,  in  1821.  Roth  were  in  flourishing
condition  when  broken  up.  with  other  Cherokee  missions,  by  the  Stair
of  Georgia  in  1834:.  The  work  was  afterward  renewed  beyond  the
Mississippi.5 In  1804  the  Reverend  Gideon  Blackburn,  a  Presbyterian  minister  of
Tennessee,  opened  a  school  among  the  Cherokee,  which  continued  for
several  years  until  abandoned  for  lack  of  funds.8
Notwithstanding  the  promise  to  the  Cherokee  in  the  treaty  of  1798
that  the  Government  would  "continue  the  guarantee  of  the  remain-
der of  their  country  forever."  measures  were  begun  almost  imme-
diately to  procure  another  large  cession  of  land  and  road  privileges.
In  spite  of  the  strenuous  objection  of  the  Cherokee,  who  sent  a
delegation  of  prominent  chiefs  to  Washington  to  protest  against  any
further  sales,  such  pressure  was  brought  to  hear,  chiefly  through  the
efforts  of  the  agent,  Colonel  Meigs,  that  the  object  of  the  Government
was  accomplished,  and  in  L804  and  1805  three  treaties  were  negotiated
at  Tellico  agency,  by  which  the  Cherokee  were  shorn  id'  more  than eight  thousand  square  miles  of  their  remaining  territory.
By  the  first  of  these  treaties  October  24,  1804 — a  purchase  was

settlement,"  upon  which  a  party  led  by  Colonel  Wafford  had  located
some  years  before,  under  the  impression  that  it  was  outside  the  bound-
ary established  bythe  Hopewell  treaty.  In  compensation  the  Cherokee
were  to  receive  an  immediate  payment  of  live  thousand  dollars  in
goods  or  cash  with  an  additional  annuity  of  one  thousand  dollars.  By
the  other  treaties — October  25 and  u'7.  L805 — a  large  tract  was  obtained
in  central  Tennessee  and  Kentucky,  extending  between  the  Cumber-
land range  and  the  western  line  of  the  Hopewell  treaty,  and  from
Cumberland  river  southwest  to  Duck  river.  One  section  was  also
secured  at  Southwest  point  (now  Kingston,  Tennessee)  with  the  design
of  establishing  there  the  state  capital,  which,  however,  was  located  at
Nashville  instead  seven  years  later.  Permission  was  also  obtained  for
two  mail  roads  through  the  Cherokee  country  into  Georgia  and  Ala-
bama. In  consideration  of  the  cessions  by  the  two  treaties  the  United
States  agreed  to  pay  fifteen  thousand  six  hundred  dollars  in  working
implements,  goods,  orcash,  with  an  additional  annuity  of  three  thousand
dollars.  To  secure  the  consent  of  some  of  the  leading  chiefs,  the
treaty  commissioners  resorted  to  the  disgraceful  precedent  of  secret
articles,  by  which  several  valuable  small  tracts  were  reserved  for
Doublehead  and  Tollunteeskee,  the  agreement  being  recorded  as  a  part
of  the  treaty,  but  not  embodied  in  the  copy  sent  to  the  Senate  for  con-
firmation.1 In  consequence  of  continued  abuse  of  his  official  position for  selfish  ends  Doublehead  was  soon  afterward  killed  in  accordance
with  a  decree  of  the  chiefs  of  the  Nation,  Major  Ridge  being  selected
as  executioner.2
By  the  treaty  of  October  25, 1805,  the  settlements  in  eastern  Tennessee
were  brought  into  connection  with  those  about  Nashville  on  the  Cumber-
land, and  the  state  at  last  assumed  compact  form.  The  whole  southern
portion  of  the  state,  as  defined  in  the  charter,  was  still  Indian  coun-
try, and  there  was  a  strong  and  constant  pressure  for  its  opening,  the
prevailing  sentiment  being  in  favor  of  making  Tennessee  river  the
boundary  between  the  two  races.  New  immigrants  were  constantly
crowding  in  from  the  east.  and.  as  Royce  says,  "the  desire  to  settle
on  Indian  land  was  as  potent  and  insatiable  with  the  average  border
settler  then  as  it  is  now."  Almost  within  two  months  of  the  last
treaties  another  one  was  concluded  at  Washington  on  January  7,  1806,
by  which  the  Cherokee  ceded  their  claim  to  a  large  tract  between
Duck  river  and  the  Tennessee,  embracing  nearly  seven  thousand
'  square  miles  in  Tennessee  and  Alabama,  together  with  the  Long  island
(Great  island)  in  Holston  river,  which  up  to  this  time  they  had  claimed
as  theirs.  They  were  promised  in  compensation  ten  thousand  dollars
in  five  cash  installments,  a  grist  mill  and  cotton  gin,  and  a  life  annuity

of  one  hundred  dollars  for  Black-fox,  the  aged  head  chief  of  the  nation.
The  signers  of  the  instrument,  including  Doublehead  and  Tollunteeskee,
were  accompanied  to  Washington  by  the  same  commissioners  who  had
procured  the  previous  treaty.  In  consequence  of  some  misunderstand
ing,  the  boundaries  <>l'  the  ceded  trad  were  Mill  further  extended  in  a supple   ntary  treaty  concluded  at  the  Chickasaw  Old  Fields  on  the
Tennessee,  on  September  11.  L807.  As  the  country  between  Duck
river  and  the  Tennessee  was  claimed  also  by  t  In-  Chickasaw,  their  title
was  extinguished  by  separate  treaties.'  The  ostensible  compensation
for  this  lust  Cherokee  cession,  as  shown  by  the  treaty,  was  two  thou
sand  dollars,  but  it  was  secretly  agreed  by  Agent  Meigs  that  what  he
calls  a  "silenl  consideration"  of  one  thousand  dollars  and  some  rifles
should  be  given  to  the  chiefs  who  signed  it.;
In  L807  Colonel  Elias  Earle,  with  the  consent  of  the  Government,
obtained  a  concession  from  the  Cherokee  for  the  establishment  of  iron
works  at  the  mouth  of  Chickamauga  creek,  on  the  south  side  of  Ten-
nessee river,  to  be  supplied  from  ores  mined  in  the  Cherokee  country.
It  was  hoped  that  this  would  be  a  considerable  step  toward  the  civili-
zation of  the  Indians,  besides  enabling  the  Government  to  obtain  its
supplies  of  manufactured  iron  at  a  cheaper  rate,  hut  after  prolonged
effort  the  project  was  finally  abandoned  on  account  of  the  refusal  of
the  state  of  Tennessee  to  sanction  the  grant.3  In  the  same  year,  by
arrangement  with  the  general  government,  the  legislature  of  Tennessee
attempted  to  negotiate  with  the  Cherokee  for  that  part  of  their  unceded
lands  lying  within  the  state  limits,  but  without  success,  owing  to  the
unwillingness  of  the  Indians  to  part  with  any  more  territory,  and  their
special  dislike  for  the  people  of  Tennessee.*
In  L810  the  Cherokee  national  council  registered  a  further  advance
in  civilization  by  formally  abolishing  the  custom  of  clan  revenge,
hitherto  universal  among  the  tribes.  The  enactment  bears  the  signa-
tures of  Black-fox  (Ina'li),  principal  chief,  and  seven  others,  and  reads
as  follows:
In  Council,  Oostinaleh,  April  IS,  1810.

okee nation  have  unanimously  passed  an  act  of  oblivion  for  all  lives  for  which  they

Bj  order  of  the  seven  clans. '
Under  an  agreement  with  the  Cherokee  in  1813a  company  composed
pf  representatives  of  Tennessee,  Georgia,  and  the  Cherokee  nation
was  organized  to  lay  out  a  free  public  road  from  Tennessee  river  to
the  head  of  navigation  on  the  Tugaloo  branch  of  Savannah  river,  with
provision  for  convenient  stopping  places  alone-  the  line.  The  road
was  completed  within  the  next  three  years,  and  became  the  great  high-
way from  the  coast  to  the  Tennessee  settlements.  Beginning  on  the
Tugaloo  or  Savannah  a  short  distance  below  the  entrance  of  Toccoa
creek,  it  crossed  the  upper  Chattahoochee,  passing  through  Clarkes-
ville,  Nacoochee  valley,  the  Unicoi  gap.  and  Hiwassee  in  Georgia;
then  entering  North  Carolina  it  descended  the  Hiwassee,  passing
through  Hayesville  and  Murphy  and  over  the  Great  Smoky  range  into
Tennessee,  until  it  reached  the  terminus  at  the  Cherokee  capital,
Echota,  on  Little  Tennessee.  It  was  officially  styled  the  Unicoi  turn-
pike,' but  was  commonly  known  in  North  Carolina  as  the  Wachesa
trail,  from  Watsi'sa  or  Wachesa,  a  prominent  Indian  who  lived  near
the  crossing-place  on  Beaverdam  creek,  below  Murphy,  this  portion
of  the  road  being  laid  out  along  the  old  Indian  trail  which  already
bore  that  name.3
Passing  over  for  the  present  some  negotiations  having  for  their  pur-
pose the  removal  of  the  Cherokee  to  the  West,  we  arrive  at  the  period
of  the  Creek  war.
Ever  since  the  treaty  of  Greenville  it  had  been  the  dream  of  Tecum-
tha,  the  great  Shawano  chief  (33),  to  weld  again  the  conf ederacj'  of  the
northern  tribes  as  a  harrier  against  the  further  aggressions  of  the  white
man.  His  own  burning  eloquence  was  ably  seconded  by  the  subtler
persuasion  of  his  brother,  who  assumed  the  role  of  a  prophet  with  a
new  revelation,  the  burden  of  which  was  that  the  Indians  must  return
to  their  old  Indian  life  it'  they  would  preserve  their  national  existence. The  new  doctrine  spread  among  all  the  northern  tribes  and  at  hist
reached  those  of  the  south,  where  TecumAha  himself  had  gone  to  enlist
the  warriors  in  the  great  Indian  confederacy.  The  prophets  of  the
Upper  Creeks  eagerly  accepted  the  doctrine  and  in  a  short  time  their
warriors  were  dancing  the  "dance  of  the  Indians  of  the  lakes."     In

anticipation  of  an  expected   war  with  the   United   Stair-  the   British
agents  in  Canada  had  I   n  encouraging  the  hostile  feeling  toward  the
Americans  by  talks  and  presents  of  goods  and  ammunition,  while  the
Spaniards  also  covertly  fanned  the  flame  of  discontent.'  At  the  beighl
of  the  ferment  war  was  declared  between  thi-  country  and  England  on
June  28,  1812.  Tecumtha,  :it  the  bead  of  fifteen  hundred  warriors,  at
once  entered  the  British  service  with  a  commission  as  general,  while
the  Creeks  began  murdering  and  burning  along  the  southern  frontier,
after  having  vainly  attempted  to  secure  the  cooperation  of  the  ( Iherokee.
From  the  Creeks  the  new  revelation  was  brought  to  the  Cherokee,
whose  priests  at  once  began  to  dream  dreams  and  to  preach  a  return  to
the  old  life  as  the  only  hope  of  the  Indian  rare.  A  greal  medicine
dance  was  appointed  at  (Jstanali,  the  national  capital,  where,  after  the
dance  was  over,  the  doctrine  was  publicly  announced  and  explained  by
a  Cherokee  prophet  introduced  by  a  delegation  from  Coosawatee.  He
began  by  saying  that  some  of  the  mountain  towns  had  abused  him  and
refused  to  receive  his  message,  hut  nevertheless  he  must  continue  to
hear  testimony  of  his  mission  whatever  might  happen.  The  Cherokee
had  broken  the  road  which  had  been  given  to  their  fathers  at  the  begin-
ningof  the  world.  They  hud  taken  the  white  man's  clothes  and  trinkets.
they  had  beds  and  tables  and  mills;  some  even  had  hooks  and  cats.  All
this  was  had,  and  because  of  it  their  gods  were  angry  and  the  game
was  leaving  their  country.  If  they  would  live  and  be  happy  as  before
they  must  put  off  the  white  man's  dress,  throw  away  his  mills  and
looms,  kill  their  cats,  put  on  paint  and  buckskin,  and  be  Indians  again;
otherwise  swift  destruction  would  come  upon  them.
His  speech  appealed  strongly  to  the  people,  who  cried  out  in  great
excitement  that  his  talk  was  good.  Of  all  those  present  only  Major
Ridge,  a  principal  child',  had  the  courage  to  stand  up  and  oppose  it, warning  his  hearers  that  such  talk  would  inevitably  lead  to  war  with
the  United  States,  which  would  end  in  their  own  destruction.  The
maddened  followers  of  the  prophet  sprang  upon  Ridge  and  would  have
killed  him  hut  for  the  interposition  of  friends.  As  it  was.  he  was  thrown
down  and  narrowly  escaped  with  his  life,  while  one  of  his  defender-
was  stabbed  by  his  side.
The  prophet  had  threatened  after  a  certain  time  to  invoke  a  terrible
storm,  which  should  destroy  all  hut  the  true  believers,  who  were
exhorted  to  gather  for  safety  on  one  of  the  high  peaks  of  the  Great
Smoky  mountains.  In  full  faith  they  abandoned  their  bees,  their
orchards,  their  slaves,  and  everything  that  had  come  to  them  from  the
white  man.  and  took  up  their  toilsome  march  for  the  high  mountains.
There  they  waited  until  the  appointed  day  had  come  and  passed,  show-

in<r  their  hopes  and  fears  t<>  be  groundless,  when  they  sadly  returned
to  their  homes  and  the  great  Indian  revival  among  the  Cherokee  came
in  an  end.1
Among  the  ('recks,  where  other  hostile  influences  were  at  work,  the excitement  culminated  in  the  Creek  war.  Several  murders  and  outrages
had  already  been  committed,  but  it  was  not  until  the  terrible  massacre
at  Fort  Minis  (34),  on  August  30,  L813,  that  the  whole  American  nation
was  aroused.  Through  the  influence  of  Ridge  and  other  prominent
chiefs  the  Cherokee  had  refused  to  join  the  hostile  Creeks,  and  on  the
contrary  had  promised  to  assist  the  whites  and  the  friendly  towns.2
More  than  a  year  before  the  council  had  sent  a  friendly  letter  to  the
Creeks  warning  them  against  taking  the  British  side  in  the  approach-
ing war,  while  several  prominent  chiefs  had  proposed  to  enlist  a  Chero-
kee force  for  the  service  of  the  United  States.'  Finding  that  no  help
was  to  be  expected  from  the  Cherokee,  the  Creeks  took  occasion  to  kill
a  Cherokee  woman  near  the  town  of  Etowah,  in  Georgia.  With  the
help  of  a  conjurer  the  murderers  were  trailed  and  overtaken  and  killed
on  the  evening  of  the  second  day  in  a  thicket  where  they  had  concealed
themselves.  After  this  there  could  be  no  alliance  between  the  two
tribes.* At  the  time  of  the  Fort  Mims  massacre  Mcintosh  (35),  the  chief  of
the  friendly  Lower  Creeks,  was  visiting  the  Cherokee,  among  whom
he  had  relatives.  By  order  of  the  Cherokee  council  he  was  escorted
home  by  a  delegation  under  the  leadership  of  Ridge.  On  his  return
Ridge  brought  with  him  a  request  from  the  Lower  Creeks  that  the
Cherokee  would  join  with  them  and  the  Americans  in  putting  down
the  war.  Ridge  himself  strongly  urged  the  proposition,  declaring
that  if  the,  prophets  were  allowed  to  have  their  way  the  work  of  civil-
ization would  be  destroyed.  The  council,  however,  decided  not  to
interfere  in  the  affairs  of  other  tribes,  whereupon  Ridge  called  for
volunteers,  with  the  result  that  so  many  of  the  warriors  responded  that
the  council  reversed  its  decision  and  declared  war  against  the  Creeks."
For  a  proper  understanding  of  the  situation  it  is  necessary  to  state  that
the  hostile  feeling  was  confined  almost  entirely  to  the  Upper  Creek
towns  on  the  Tallapoosa,  where  the  prophets  of  the  new  religion  had
their  residence.  The  half-breed  chief,  Weatherford  (•".»'.).  was  the
leader  of  the  war  party.     The  Lower  Creek  towns  on  the  Clu.ttahoo-

chec,  under  Mcintosh,  another  half-breed  chief ,  were  friendly,  and
acted  with  the  Cherokee  and  the  Americans  against  their  own  brethren.
It  is  not  our  purpose  to  give  a  history  of  the  Creek  war,  but  only
to  note  the  part  which  the  Cherokee  had  in  it.  The  friendly  Lower
Creeks,  under  Mcintosh,  with  a  few  refugees  from  the  Upper  towns,
operated  chiefly  with  the  army  under  Genera]  Floyd  which  invaded
the  southern  pari  of  the  Creels  country  from  Georgia.  Some  friendly
Choctaw  and  Chickasaw  also  lenl  their  assistance  in  tin-  direction.
The  Cherokee,  with  some  friendly  Creeks  of  the  Upper  towns,  acted
with  tli*'  armies  under  Generals  White  and  .lack-on.  which  entered
the  Creek  country  from  the  Tennessee  side.  While  some  hundreds
of  their  warriors  were  thus  fighting  in  the  field,  the  Cherokee  at  home
were  busily  collecting  provisions  for  the  American  troops.
As  Jackson  approached  from  the  north,  about  the  end  of  October,
L813,  be  wa-  met  by  runners  asking  him  to  come  to  the  aid  of  Path-
killer,  a  Cherokee  chief,  who  was  in  danger  of  being  cut  off  by  the
hostilcs.  at  his  village  of  Turkeytown,  on  the  upper  Coosa,  near  the
present  Center.  Alabama.  A  fresh  detachment  on  its  way  from  east
Tennessee,  under  General  White,  was  ordered  by  Jackson  to  relieve
the  town,  and  successfully  performed  this  work.  White's  force  con-
sisted of  one  thousand  men.  including  four  hundred  Cherokee  under
Colonel  Gideon  Morgan  and  .John  Lowrey.1
As  the  army  advanced  down  the  Coosa  the  Creeks  retired  to  Tallasee-
hatchee,  on  the  creek  of  the  same  name,  near  the  present  Jacksonville,
Calhoun  county.  Alabama.  One  thousand  men  under  General  Coffee,
together  with  a  company  of  Cherokee  under  Captain  Richard  Brown
and  some  few  Creeks,  were  sent  against  them.  The  Indian  auxiliaries
wore  headdresses  of  white  feathers  and  deertails.  The  attack  was
made  at  daybreak  of  November  •"».  1813,  and  the  town  was  taken  after
a  desperate  resistance,  from  which  not  one  <ff  the  defenders  escaped
alive,  the  Creeks  having  been  completely  surrounded  on  all  sides.
Says  Coffee  in  his  official  report:
They  made  all  the  resistance  thai  an  overpowered  soldier  could  '1<> — they  fought  as
long  as  "lie  existed,  but  their  destruction  was  very  Boon  completed.  Our  men  rushed
up  i"  the  doors  of  the  house- ami  in  a  few  minutes  killed  the  last  warrior  of  then).
The  enemy  f ought  with  savage  fury  and  met  death  with  all  its  horrors,  without
shrinking  or  complaining — not  one  asked  to  he  spared,  butfought  as  long  as  they could  stand  or  sit.
<  )f  such  fighting  stuff  did  the  Creeks  prove  themselves,  against  over
whelming  numbers,  throughout  the  war.  The  bodies  of  nearly  two
hundred  dead  warriors  were  counted  on  the  field,  and  the  general
reiterates  that  "not  one  of  the  warriors  escaped."  A  number  of
women  and  children  were  taken  prisoners.  Nearly  every  man  of  the
Creeks  had  a  how    with   a  bundle  of  arrows,  which  he  used  after  the

first  fire  with  his  gun.  The  American  loss  was  only  five  killed  and
forty-one  wounded,  which  may  not  include  the  Indian  contingent.1
White's  advance  guard,  consisting  chiefly  of  the  four  hundred  other Cherokee  under  Morgan  and  Lowrey,  reached  Tallaseehatchee  the  same
evening,  only  to  find  it  already  destroyed.  They  picked  up  twenty
wounded  Creeks,  whom  they  brought  with  them  to  Turkeytown.5
The  next  great  battle  was  at  Talladega,  on  the  site  of  the  present
town  of  the  same  name,  in  Talladega  county.  Alabama,  on  November 9,
1813.  Jackson  commanded  in  person  with  two  thousand  infantry  and
cavalry.  Although  the  Cherokee  are  not  specifically  mentioned  they
were  a  part  of  the  army  and  must  have  taken  part  in  the  engagement.
The  town  itself  was  occupied  by  friendly  Creeks,  who  were  besieged

side. Here  again  the  battle  was  simply  a  slaughter,  the  odds  being
two  to  one.  the  Creeks  being  also  without  cover,  although  they  fought
.so  desperately  that  at  one  time  the  militia  was  driven  back.  They
left  two  hundred  and  ninety-nine  dead  bodies  on  the  field,  which,
according  to  their  own  statement  afterwards,  was  only  a  part  of
their  total  loss.  The  Americans  lost  fifteen  killed  and  eighty-five
wounded.3
A  day  or  two  later  the  people  of  Hillabee  town,  about  the  site  of
the  present  village  of  that  name  in  Clay  county.  Alabama,  sent  mes-
sengers to  Jackson's  camp  to  ask  for  peace,  which  that  commander
immediately  granted.  In  the  meantime,  even  while  the  peace  mes-
sengers were  on  their  way  home  with  the  good  news,  an  army  of  one
thousand  men  from  east  Tennessee  under  General  White,  who  claimed
to  be  independent  of  Jackson's  authority,  together  with  four  hundred Cherokee  under  Colonel  Gideon  Morgan  and  John  Lowrey.  surrounded
the  town  on  November  18,  1813,  taking  it  by  surprise,  the  inhabitants
having  trusted  so  confidently  to  the  success  of  their  peace  embassy
that  they  had  made  no  preparation  for  defense.  Sixty  warriors  were
killed  and  over  two  hundred  and  fifty  prisoners  taken,  with  no  loss  to
the  Americans,  as  there  was  practically  no  resistance.  In  White's
official  report  of  the  affair  he  states  that  he  had  sent  ahead  a  part  of
his  force,  together  with  the  Cherokee  under  Morgan,  to  surround  the
town,  and  adds  that  "Colonel  Morgan  and  the  Cherokees  under  his
command  gave  undeniable  evidence  that  they  merit  the  employ  of
their  government."'  Not  knowing  that  the  attack  had  been  made
without  Jackson's  sanction  or  knowledge,  the  Creeks  naturally  con-

eluded  thai  peace  overtures  were  of  no  avail,  and  thenceforth  until
tlir  close  of  the  war  there  was  m>  talk  of  surrender.
On  November  29,  L813,  the  Georgia  army  under  General  Floyd,
consisting  of  nine  hundred  and  fifty  American  troops  and  four  hun-
dred friendly  Indian-,  chiefly  Lower  Creeks  under  Mcintosh,  took
and  destroyed  Autossee  town  on  the  Tallapoosa,  west  of  the  present
Tuskegee.  killing  about  two  hundred  warriors  and  burning  four  hun-
dred well-buill  nouses.  On  December  .'•':  the  Creeks  were  again
defeated  by  General  Claiborne,  assisted  by  some  friendly  Choctaws,
at  Ecanachaca  or  the  Holy  Ground  on  Alabama  river,  near  the  present
Benton  in  Low  ndes  county.  This  town  and  another  a  few  miles  awav
were  also  destroyed,  with  a  great  quantity  of  provisions  and  other
property.1  It  is  doubtful  if  any  Cherokee  were  concerned  in  either action.
Before  the  close  of  the  year  Jackson's  force  in  northern  Alabama
had  been  so  far  reduced  by  mutinies  and  expiration  of  service  terms
that  he  had  l>ut  one  hundred  soldiers  left  and  was  obliged  to  employ
the  Cherokee  to  garrison  Fort  Armstrong,  on  the  upper  Coosa,  ami  to
protect  his  provision  depot.'  With  theopeningof  the  new  year,  L814,
having  received  reinforcements  from  Tennessee,  together  with  about
two  hundred  friendly  Creeks  and  sixty-five  more  Cherokee,  he  left  his
camp  on  the  Coosa  and  advanced  against  the  towns  on  the  Tallapoosa.
Learning,  on  arriving  near  the  river,  that  he  was  within  a  few  miles
of  the  main  body  of  the  enemy,  he  halted  for  a  reconnoissance  and
camped  in  order  of  Wattle  on  Fmukfaw  creek,  on  the  northern  hank  of
the  Tallaj   sa,  only  a  short  distance  from  the  famous  Horseshoe  bend.
Here,  on  the  morning  of  June  24,  1814,  he  was  suddenly  attacked  by
the  enemy  with  such  fury  that,  although  the  troops  charged  with  the
bayonet,  the  Creeks  returned  again  to  the  fight  and  were  at  last  broken
only  by  the  help  of  the  friendly  Indians,  who  came  upon  them  from
the  rear.  As  it  was,  .lack-on  was  so  badly  crippled  that  he  retreated
to  Fort  Strother  on  the  Coosa,  carrying  his  wounded,  among  them  ( ren-
eral  Coffee,  on  horse-hide  litters.  The  Creeks  pursued  and  attacked
him  again  as  he  was  crossing  Enotochopco  creek  on  January  24,  hut
after  a  severe  fight  were  driven  back  with  discharges  of  grapeshot  from
a  six-pounder  at  close  range.  The  army  then  continued  its  retreat  to
Fort  Strother.  The  American  loss  in  these  two  battles  was  about  one
hundred  killed  and  wounded.  The  loss  of  the  ( 'reeks  was  much  greater,
hut  they  had  compelled  a  superior  force,  armed  with  bayonet  and
artillery,  to  retreat,  and  without  the  aid  of  the  friendly  Indians  it  is
doubtful  if  Jackson  could  have  saved  his  army  from  demoralization.
The    Creeks    themselves   claimed   a  victory  and   boasted   afterward
that    they  had    "  whipped  Jackson   and    run    him    to   the  Coosa    fiver."

hookey]  BATTLE    OF    HORSESHOE    BEND — 1814  V)3
Pickett  states,  on  what  seems  good  authority,  that  the  Creeks  engaged
did  not  number  more  than  five  hundred  warriors.  Jackson  had  prob-
ably at  least  one  thousand  two  hundred  men.  including  Indians.1
While  these  events  were  transpiring  in  the  north,  General  Floyd
again  advanced  from  Georgia  with  a  force  of  about  one  thousand  three
hundred  Americans  and  four  hundred  friendly  Indians,  but  was  sur-
prised on  Caleebee  creek,  near  the  present  Tuskegee,  Alabama,  on  the
morning  of  January  27,  1814,  and  compelled  to  retreat,  leaving  the
enemy  in  possession  of  the  field.2 We  come  now  to  the  final  event  of  the  Creek  war,  the  terrible  battle
of  the  Horseshoe  bend.  Having  received  large  reenforcements  from
Tennessee,  Jackson  left  a  garrison  at  Fort  Strother,  and.  about  the
middle  of  March,  descended  the  Coosa  river  to  the  mouth  of  Cedar
creek,  southeast  from  the  present  Columbiana,  where  he  built  Fori
Williams.  Leaving  his  stores  here  with  a  garrison  to  protect  them,
he  began  his  march  for  the  Horseshoe  bend  of  the  Tallapoosa,  where
the  hostiles  were  reported  to  have  collected  in  great  force.  At  this
place,  known  to  the  Creeks  as  Tohopki  or  Tohopeka,  the  Tallapoosa
made  a  bend  so  as  to  inclose  some  eighty  or  a  hundred  acres  in  a  nar-
row peninsula  opening  to  the  north.  On  the  lower  side  was  an  island
in  the  river,  and  about  a  mile  below  was  Emukfaw  creek,  entering  from
the  north,  where  Jackson  had  been  driven  back  two  months  before
Both  locations  were  in  the  present  Tallapoosa  county.  Alabama,  within
two  miles  of  the  present  post  village  of  Tohopeka.  Across  the  neck  of
the  peninsula  the  Creeks  had  built  a  strong  breastwork  of  logs,  behind
which  were  their  houses,  and  behind  these  were  a  number  of  canoes
moored  to  the  bank  for  use  if  retreat  became  necessary.  The  fort  was
defended  by  a  thousand  warriors,  with  whom  were  also  about  three
hundred  women  and  children.  Jackson's  force  numbered  about  two
thousand  men,  including,  according  to  his  own  statement,  five  hundred
Cherokee.  He  had  also  two  small  cannon.  The  account  of  the  battle,
or  rather  massacre,  which  occurred  on  the  morning  of  .March  •_'".  1814, is  best  condensed  from  the  official  reports  of  the  principal  commanders.
Having  arrived  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  fort,  Jackson  disposed
his  men  for  the  attack  by  detailing  General  Coffee  with  the  mounted
men  and  nearly  the  whole  of  the  Indian  force  to  cross  the  river  at  a
foi-d  about  three  miles  below  and  surround  the  bend  in  such  manner
that  none  could  escape  in  that  direction.  He  himself,  with  the  restof
his  force,  advanced  to  the  front  of  the  breastwork  and  planted  hiscan-

iiuii  upon  a  slight  rise  within  eighty  yards  of  the  fortification,  tie  then
directed  a  heavy  cannonade  upon  the  center  of  the  breastwork,  while
the  rifles  mid  muskets  kept  up  a  galling  fire  upon  the  defenders  when-
ever they  showed  themselves  behind  the  logs.  The  breastwork  was
very  strongly  and  compactly  built,  from  five  to  eight  feel  high,  with  a
double  row  of  portholes,  and  so  planned  that  no  enemy  could  approach
without  being  exposed  to  a  crossfire  from  those  on  the  inside.  After
about  two  hours  of  cannonading  and  rifle  fire  to  no  great  purpose,
"Captain  Russell's  company  of  spies  and  a  party  of  the  Cherokee
tone,  headed  by  their  gallant  chieftain,  Colonel  Richard  Brown,  and
conducted  by  the  brave  Colonel  Morgan,  crossed  over  to  the  peninsula
in  canoes  and  set  fire  to  a  few  of  their  buildings  there  situated.  They
then  advanced  with  great  gallantry  toward  the  breastwork  and  com-
menced firing  upon  the  enemy,  who  lay  behind  it.  Finding  that  this
force,  notwithstanding  the  determination  they  displayed,  was  wholly
insufficient  to  dislodge  the  enemy,  and  that  General  Coffee  had  secured
the  opposite  hanks  of  the  river.  I  now  determined  on  taking  possession
of  their  works  by  storm.'" '
Coffee's  official  report  to  his  commanding  officer  states  that  he  had
taken  seven  hundred  mounted  troops  and  about  six  hundred  Indians,
of  whom  five  hundred  were  Cherokee  and  the  rest  friendly  Creeks,
and  had  come  in  behind,  having-  directed  the  Indians  to  take  position
secretly  along  the  bank  of  the  river  to  prevent  the  enemy  crossing,  as
already  noted.  This  was  done,  but  with  fighting  going  on  so  near  at
hand  the  Indians  could  not  remain  quiet.     Continuing,  Coffee  says:
The  firing  of  your  cannon  and  small  arms  in  a  short  time  l>ecame  general  and
heavy,  which  animated  our  Indians,  and  seeing  about  one  hundred  of  the  warriors
and  all  the  squaws  and  children  of  the  enemy  running  about  among  the  huts  of  the
village,  which  was  open  to  our  view,  they  could  no  longer  remain  silent  spectators.
While  some  kept  up  a  fire  across  the  river  to  prevent  the  enemy's  approach  to  the
hank,  others  plunged  into  the  water  ami  swam  the  river  for  canoes  thai  lay  at  the
other  shore  in  considerable  numbers  and  brought  them  over,  in  which  crafts  a  num-
ber of  them  embarked  and  landed  on  the  bend  with  the  enemy.  Colonel  Gideon
Morgan,  who  <   unanded  the  Cherokees,  Captain  Kerr,  and  Captain  William  Rus-
sell, with  a  part  of  his  company  of  spies,  were  a   lg  the  first  that  crossed  the  river.
They  advanced  into  the  village  and  very  soon  drove  the  enemy  from  the  huts  up
the  river  bank  to  the  fortified  works  from  which  they  were  fighting  you.  They
pursued  and  continued  to  annoy  during  your  whole  action.  This  movement  of  my
Indian  forces  left  the  river  bank  unguarded  and  made  it  necessary  that  I  should  send
a  part  of  my  line  to  take  possession  of  the  river  bank.9
According  to  the  official  report  of  Colonel  Morgan,  who  commanded
the  Cherokee  and  who  was  himself  Severely  wounded,  the  Cherokee
took  the  places  assigned  them  along  the  bank  in  such  regular  order

that  no  part  was  left  unoccupied,  and  the  few  fugitives  who  attempted
to  escape  from  the  fort  by  water  "fell  an  easy  prey  to  their  ven-
geance." Finally,  seeing  that  the  cannonade  had  no  mure  effect  upon
the  breastwork  than  to  bore  holes  in  the  logs,  some  of  the  Cherokee
plunged  into  the  river,  and  swimming  over  to  the  town  brought  back
a  number  of  canoes.  A  part  crossed  in  these,  under  cover  of  the  guns
of  their  companions,  and  sheltered  themselves  under  the  bank  while
the  canoes  were  sent  hack  for  reenforcements.  In  this  way  they  all
crossed  over  and  then  advanced  up  the  bank,  where  at  once  they  were
warmly  assailed  from  every  side  except  the  rear,  which  they  kept  open
only  by  hard  righting.1
The  Creeks  had  been  righting  the  Americans  in  their  front  at  such
close  quarters  that  their  bullets  flattened  upon  the  bayonets  thrust
through  the  portholes.  This  attack  from  the  rear  by  five  hundred
Cherokee  diverted  their  attention  and  gave  opportunity  to  the  Tennes-
seeans,  Sam  Houston  among  them,  cheering  them  on.  to  swarm  over
the  breastwork.  With  death  from  the  bullet,  the  bayonet  and  the
hatchet  all  around  them,  and  the  smoke  of  their  blazing  homes  in  their
eyes,  not  a  warrior  begged  for  his  life.  When  more  than  half  their
number  lay  dead  upon  the  ground,  the  rest  turned  and  plunged  into
the  river,  only  to  rind  the  banks  on  the  opposite  side  lined  with  enemies
and  escape  cut  off  in  every  direction.     Says  General  Coffee:
Attempts  to  cross  the  river  at  all  points  of  the  bend  were  made  by  the  enemy,  but
nnt  .me  ever  escaped.  Very  few  ever  reached  the  bank  and  that  lew  was  killed  the
instant  they  landed.  From  the  report  of  my  officers,  as  well  as  from  my  own  obser-
vation, I  feel  warranted  in  saying  that  from  two  hundred  and  fifty  to  three  hundred
of  the  enemy  was  buried  under  water  and  was  not  numbered  with  tin-  dead  that were  found.
Some  swam  for  the  island  below  the  bend,  but  here  too  a  detach-
ment had  been  posted  and  "  not  one  ever  landed.  They  were  sunk  by
Lieutenant  Bean's  command  ere  they  reached  the  bank."  :
Quoting  again  from  Jackson —
The  enemy,  although  many  of  them  fought  to  the  last  with  that  kind  of  bravery
which  desperation  inspires,  were  at  last  entirely  routed  and  cut  to  pieces.  The  battle
may  be  said  to  have  continued  with  severity  for  about  five  hours,  but  the  firing  and
slaughter  continued  until  it  was  suspended  by  the  darkness  of  night.  The  next
morning  it  was  resumed  and  sixteen  of  the  enemy  slain  who  had  concealed  them-
selves under  the  banks.3
It  was  supposed  that  the  Creeks  had  about  a  thousand  warriors,
besides  their  women  and  children.  The  men  sent  out  to  count  the
dead  found  five  hundred  and  fifty-seven  warriors  lying  dead  within  the
inclosure,  and  Coffee  estimates  that  from  two  hundred  and  fifty  to

three  hundred  were  shot  in  the  water.  How  many  more  there  may
have  been  can  not  be  known,  bul  Jackson  himself  states  that  not  more
than  twenty  could  have  escaped.  There  is  no  mention  of  any  wounded.
About  three  hundred  prisoners  were  taken,  of  whom  only  three  were
men.     The  defenders  of  the  Horseshoe  had  been  exterminated.'
( )n  the  other  side  the  loss  vras  26  Americans  killed  and  I07  wounded,
18  Cherokee  killed  and  36  wounded.  5  friendly  Creeks  killed  and  11
wounded.  It  will  be  noted  that  the  Loss  of  the  Cherokee  was  out  of
all  proportion  to  their  numbers,  their  fighting  having  been  hand  to
hand  work  without  protecting  cover.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  Jack-
son had  only  a  few  weeks  before  been  compelled  to  retreat  before  this
same  enemy,  and  that  two  hours  of  artillery  and  rifle  fire  had  produced
no  result  until  the,  Cherokee  turned  the  rear  of  the  enemy  by  their
daring  passage  of  the  river,  there  is  considerable  truth  in  the  boast  of
the  Cherokee  that  they  saved  the  day  for  Jackson  at  Horseshoe  bend.
In  the  number  of  men  actually  engaged  and  the  immense  proportion
killed,  this  ranks  as  the  greatest  Indian  battle  in  the  history  of  the
United  States,  with  the  possible  exception  of  the  battle  of  Mauvila,
fought  by  the  same  Indians  in  De  Soto's  time.  The  result  was  decisive. Two  weeks  later  Weatherford  came  in  and  surrendered,  and  the  Creek
war  was  at  an  end.
As  is  usual  where  Indians  have  acted  as  auxiliaries  of  white  troops,  it
is  difficult  to  get  an  accurate  statement  of  the  number  of  Cherokee
engaged  in  this  war  or  to  apportion  the  credit  among  the  various
leaders.  Coffee's  official  report  states  that  five  hundred  Cherokee
were  engaged  in  the  last  great  battle,  and  from  incidental  hints  it
seems  probable  that  others  were  employed  elsewhere,  on  garrison  duty
or  otherwise,  at  the  same  time.  McKenney  and  Hall  state  that  Ridge
recruited  eight  hundred  warriors  for  Jackson,8  and  this  may  be  near
the  truth,  as  the  tribe  had  then  at  least  six  times  as  many  fighting  men.
On  account  of  the  general  looseness  of  Indian  organization  we  com
monly  find  the  credit  claimed  for  whichever  chief  may  be  best  known
to  the  chronicler.  Thus.  McKenney  and  Hall  make  Major  Ridge  the
hero  of  the  war.  especially  of  the  Horseshoe  fight,  although  he  is  not
mentioned  in  the  official  reports.  Jackson  speaks  particularly  of  the
Cherokee  in  that  battle  as  being  "headed  by  their  gallant  chieftain,
Colonel  Richard  Brown,  and  conducted  by  the  brave  Colonel  Mor-
gan." Coffee  says  that  Colonel  Gideon  Morgan  "commanded  the
Cherokees,"  and  it  is  Morgan  who  makes  the  official  report  of  their
