This book of Hopi folklore,
 collected by an ethnographer early in the 20th century,
 is one of the most extensive available.
It includes a hundred Hopi folk tales, including mythology of
 the emergence from the underworld, legends of the wanderings of the clans,
 plus historical legends.
It is now known that the Hopi were a bit selective in what
 they told the earliest researchers, but this does not
 lessen the value of this collection, or call into question
 its authenticity.
