      MYTHS OF DEATH. To account for death, regarded by some
      savage races as unnatural. Usually some custom or taboo is
      supposed to have been broken, or some ritual neglected or
      mismanaged, and death has followed. The reasons given by
      the different races are as follows:

      _Greeks_. Death comes from lifting cover off Pandora's box.

      _Hindus_. Yama is pioneer to the Otherworld.

      _Southern India_. Death (snake) bites men while God
      sleeps. God makes dog drive away snake; thus dogs howl at
      approach of death.

      _Ningphos_ (Bengal). Think they became mortal through
      bathing in tabooed water.

      _Bushmen_. The mother of the little hare is dead. The moon
      strikes the hare on its lip, splitting it in two, and
      tells it that its mother is really dead and will not live
      again as the moon does.

      _Hottentots_. The moon sends the hare to men to tell them
      that they will live again as he (the moon) does, but the
      hare forgets the message and tells men that they will
      surely die, for which mistake the moon burns a hole in his
      lip.

      _Namaquas_. The hare and the moon's mother.

      _Central Africans_. Sleep unknown; woman offers to teach
      man how to sleep; holds his nostrils; man never wakes;
      dying made easy.

      _Hurons_. Atænsic (the moon) destroys the living,

      _Australians_. Woman goes near a forbidden tree.

      _New Zealand_. Mani was not properly baptized.

      _Fiji Islanders_. The moon desired that men should die and
      live again like herself, but the rat opposed this, and so
      men die as rats do.

      _Polynesians_. Mani tries to pass through Night, a little
      bird sings, night awakes, snaps up Mani, and "so men die."

      _Banks Islanders_. Qat, Mate, Panoi, and Tangaro the Fool.
      Tangaro the Fool is set to watch the path taken by Death,
      that men may avoid it, but makes the mistake of pointing
      to men the path to Hades as that of the path of the upper
      world. So men have, perforce, to follow this road to Panoi
      and the dead.

      _Pentecost Islanders_. Tagar makes man die for live days
      only and live again, but Suque causes them to die for ever.

      _Solomon Islanders_. Koevari resumes cast-off skin.

      always held to be the goddess of water, dampness, dews,
      rain, and fogs. Moon and water are both mythical mothers
      of the human race.

      _Greeks_. Selene.

      are metamorphosed men, women, or beasts; in some cases
      ancestors, in others gods. The belief that the good at
      death become stars is very widely spread.

      _Egyptians_. Plutarch was shown Isis and Osiris in the sky.
      _Babylonians_. Many gods are represented by stars. Babylonian
      astrology favoured the evolution of gods into planets.

      Castor and Pollux are young men.
      _Hindus_. Prajapati and his daughter become constellations.

      rivers, baptism, etc. A few examples only can be given.

      _Greeks_. Myth of Dionysus and Pentheus, to explain
      festival of the former. See Euripides, _The Bacchæ_.

      _A-Kikuyus_ (Bantu tribe, E. Africa). To explain sacrifices
      to Ngai (rain-god).

      _Todas_ (Southern India). To explain why the sacred
