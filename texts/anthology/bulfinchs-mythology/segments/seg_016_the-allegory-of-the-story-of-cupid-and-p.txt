The allegory of the story of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in
the beautiful lines of T. K. Harvey:

    "They wove bright fables in the days of old,
       When reason borrowed fancy's painted wings;
     When truth's clear river flowed o'er sands of gold,
       And told in song its high and mystic things!
     And such the sweet and solemn tale of her
       The pilgrim heart, to whom a dream was given,
     That led her through the world,--Love's worshipper,--
       To seek on earth for him whose home was heaven!

    "In the full city,--by the haunted fount,--
       Through the dim grotto's tracery of spars,--
     'Mid the pine temples, on the moonlit mount,
       Where silence sits to listen to the stars;
     In the deep glade where dwells the brooding dove,
       The painted valley, and the scented air,
     She heard far echoes of the voice of Love,
       And found his footsteps' traces everywhere.

    "But nevermore they met since doubts and fears,
       Those phantom shapes that haunt and blight the earth,
     Had come 'twixt her, a child of sin and tears,
       And that bright spirit of immortal birth;
     Until her pining soul and weeping eyes
     Had learned to seek him only in the skies;
     Till wings unto the weary heart were given,
     And she became Love's angel bride in heaven!"
