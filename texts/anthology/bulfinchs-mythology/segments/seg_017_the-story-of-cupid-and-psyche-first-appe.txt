The story of Cupid and Psyche first appears in the works of
Apuleius, a writer of the second century of our era. It is
therefore of much more recent date than most of the legends of the
Age of Fable. It is this that Keats alludes to in his "Ode to
Psyche":

    "O latest born and loveliest vision far
       Of all Olympus' faded hierarchy!
     Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-regioned star
       Or Vesper, amorous glow-worm of the sky;
     Fairer than these, though temple thou hast none,
       Nor altar heaped with flowers;
     Nor virgin choir to make delicious moan
       Upon the midnight hours;
     No voice, no lute, no pipe, no incense sweet,
       From chain-swung censor teeming;
     No shrine, no grove, no oracle, no heat
       Of pale-mouthed prophet dreaming."

In Moore's "Summer Fete" a fancy ball is described, in which one
of the characters personated is Psyche--


    "... not in dark disguise to-night
     Hath our young heroine veiled her light;--
     For see, she walks the earth, Love's own.
       His wedded bride, by holiest vow
     Pledged in Olympus, and made known
       To mortals by the type which now
       Hangs glittering on her snowy brow.
     That butterfly, mysterious trinket,
     Which means the soul, (though few would think it,)
     And sparkling thus on brow so white
     Tells us we've Psyche here to-night."
