The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is the most widely read of the five
Chinese Classics
.
 The book was traditionally written by the legendary Chinese
 Emperor Fu Hsi (2953-2838 B.C.).  It is possible that the
 the I Ching originated from a prehistoric divination technique which
 dates back as far as 5000 B.C.  Thus it may be the oldest text at this site.
 Futher commentaries were added by King Wen and the Duke of Chou in the
 eleventh century B.C.
An I Ching interpretation is performed by making
 six binary decisions (a hexagram).  This is called 'casting the I Ching'.
 These are written down as a stack of six solid or broken lines.
 This was traditionally done either by tossing yarrow
 stalks or coins, although there is no reason why
 the hexagrams can't be generated by some other means
 (such as a computer program).
There are actually
four
possible values for each of the lines; the two 
 on/off values, and a line which changes from on to off or vice versa.
 Thus one cast of the I Ching can generate two different hexagrams,
 which adds depth to the interpretation.
 The sophistication of this method has not escaped modern interpretation,
 and the four-valued logic has been compared to the biochemistry of
DNA amino acids
.
 How a Neolithic shamans' divination technique
 presaged the basic logic of the human genome is one of the ageless mysteries.
Production Notes
:
 This is a complete overhaul of the Legge I Ching etext, with all of the
 original illustrations.
 This utilizes
Unicode characters
throughout to represent the 'short A' and the 'Yodh' found in the original book.
 Because not all browsers support the official Unicode 'Yodh'
 (Ȝ and ȝ),
 we have used Ž and ž to represent it.
 In addition, we have used images to present the dozen or so Chinese
 characters in this text.
