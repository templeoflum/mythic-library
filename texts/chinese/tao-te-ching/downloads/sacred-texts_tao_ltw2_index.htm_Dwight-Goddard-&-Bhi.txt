Laotzu's Tao and Wu Wei
Second Edition
By Dwight Goddard, et al
[1939]
This is the second edition of Dwight Goddard's Tao te Ching translation.
 This is very different than the
first edition
.
 Goddard, the author of
The Buddhist Bible
,
 in the interim between the first and second edition of this book converted
 to Buddhism from Christianity.
 The core of the book, the Tao te Ching translation, is radically
 different than the first edition.
 This is apparently the translation included 
 in successive versions of the Buddhist Bible (it is not in the etext of the
 first edition of the Buddhist Bible at this site).
 Goddard, collaborating with Bhikshu Wai-Tao, produced a much wordier
 translation of this very difficult text on the second iteration; which is not
 necessarily a bad thing....
I have linked each chapter of the Tao te Ching
 to the first edition so readers can compare the two (Note: you will have to use
 the 'back' button to return to this version).
 Other additions include an second introduction and a short
 sketch of the later history of Taoism.
 The Henri Borel section is unchanged, but it is included in this etext
 for completeness.
