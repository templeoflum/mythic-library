A note from the digitizer for the Big 5 version

Your computer must have the Big 5 character set (Traditional
Chinese) installed to display the Chinese text in this file
correctly.

This text preserves the original page breaks. In a few places I
have substituted the character forms available in the Big 5
character set for rare or (what are now considered)
nonstandard forms used by Legge. Characters not included in
the Big 5 character set in any form are described by their
constituent elements.


A note for the Unicode version

This Unicode version was made directly from the Big 5 original,
and so the same note about substitute characters applies; no
attempt has been made to undo the substitutions. However, of
course, you will need support for Unicode rather than Big 5
to view this file.
