PREFACE


In recent years a reawakening has taken place in the study of American
archæology and antiquities, owing chiefly to the labours of a band of
scholars in the United States and a few enthusiasts in the continent
of Europe. For the greater part of the nineteenth century it appeared
as if the last word had been written upon Mexican archæology. The lack
of excavations and exploration had cramped the outlook of scholars,
and there was nothing for them to work upon save what had been done in
this respect before their own time. The writers on Central America who
lived in the third quarter of the last century relied on the travels
of Stephens and Norman, and never appeared to consider it essential
that the country or the antiquities in which they specialised should
be examined anew, or that fresh expeditions should be equipped to
discover whether still further monuments existed relating to the
ancient peoples who raised the teocallis of Mexico and the huacas of
Peru. True, the middle of the century was not altogether without its
Americanist explorers, but the researches of these were performed in
a manner so perfunctory that but few additions to the science resulted
from their labours.

Modern Americanist archæology may be said to have been the creation of
a brilliant band of scholars who, working far apart and without any
attempt at co-operation, yet succeeded in accomplishing much. Among
these may be mentioned the Frenchmen Charnay and de Rosny, and the
Americans Brinton, H. H. Bancroft, and Squier. To these succeeded
the German scholars Seler, Schellhas, and Förstemann, the Americans
Winsor, Starr, Savile, and Cyrus Thomas, and the Englishmen Payne and
Sir Clements Markham. These men, splendidly equipped for the work they
had taken in hand, were yet hampered by the lack of reliable data--a
want later supplied partly by their own excavations and partly by the
painstaking labours of Professor Maudslay, now the principal of the
International College of Antiquities at Mexico, who, with his wife,
is responsible for the exact pictorial reproductions of many of the
ancient edifices in Central America and Mexico.

Writers in the sphere of Mexican and Peruvian myth have been few. The
first to attack the subject in the light of the modern science of
comparative religion was Daniel Garrison Brinton, professor of American
languages and archæology in the University of Philadelphia. He has
been followed by Payne, Schellhas, Seler, and Förstemann, all of whom,
however, have confined the publication of their researches to isolated
articles in various geographical and scientific journals. The remarks
of mythologists who are not also Americanists upon the subject of
American myth must be accepted with caution.

The question of the alphabets of ancient America is perhaps the most
acute in present-day pre-Columbian archæology. But progress is being
made in this branch of the subject, and several German scholars are
working in whole-hearted co-operation to secure final results.

What has Great Britain accomplished in this new and fascinating field
of science? If the lifelong and valuable labours of the venerable Sir
Clements Markham be excepted, almost nothing. It is earnestly hoped
that the publication of this volume may prove the means of leading many
English students to the study and consideration of American archæology.

There remains the romance of old America. The real interest of American
mediæval history must ever circle around Mexico and Peru--her golden
empires, her sole exemplars of civilisation; and it is to the books
upon the character of these two nations that we must turn for a
romantic interest as curious and as absorbing as that bound up in
the history of Egypt or Assyria.

If human interest is craved for by any man, let him turn to the
narratives of Garcilasso el Inca de la Vega and Ixtlilxochitl,
representatives and last descendants of the Peruvian and Tezcucan
monarchies, and read there the frightful story of the path to fortune
of red-heeled Pizarro and cruel Cortés, of the horrible cruelties
committed upon the red man, whose colour was "that of the devil," of
the awful pageant of gold-sated pirates laden with the treasures of
palaces, of the stripping of temples whose very bricks were of gold,
whose very drain-pipes were of silver, of rapine and the sacrilege of
high places, of porphyry gods dashed down the pyramidal sides of lofty
teocallis, of princesses torn from the very steps of the throne--ay,
read these for the most wondrous tales ever writ by the hand of man,
tales by the side of which the fables of Araby seem dim--the story
of a clash of worlds, the conquest of a new, of an isolated hemisphere.

It is usual to speak of America as "a continent without a history." The
folly of such a statement is extreme. For centuries prior to European
occupation Central America was the seat of civilisations boasting a
history and a semi-historical mythology second to none in richness and
interest. It is only because the sources of that history are unknown
to the general reader that such assurance upon the lack of it exists.

Let us hope that this book may assist in attracting many to the
head-fountain of a river whose affluents water many a plain of beauty
not the less lovely because bizarre, not the less fascinating because
somewhat remote from modern thought.

In conclusion I have to acknowledge the courtesy of the Bureau of
American Ethnology, which placed in my hands a valuable collection of
illustrations and allowed me to select from these at my discretion. The
pictures chosen include the drawings used as tailpieces to chapters;
others, usually half-tones, are duly acknowledged where they occur.
