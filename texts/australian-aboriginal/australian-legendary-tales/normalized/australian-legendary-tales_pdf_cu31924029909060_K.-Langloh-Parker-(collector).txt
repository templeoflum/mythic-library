Preface
ANEIGHBOUR ofmine exclaimed, when Imentioned that I
proposed making asmall collection ofthefolk-lore legends
ofthetribe ofblacks Iknew sowell living onthis station,
"Buthave theblacks anylegends ?"—thusshowing that
people may live inacountry, andyetknow little ofthe
aboriginal inhabitants ;and though there areprobably
manywhodoknow these particular legends, yet Ithink
that this isthe firstattempt thathasbeenmade tocollect
thetales ofany particular tribe, andpublish them alone.
Atallevents, Iknow thatnoattempt hasbeenmade pre-
viously, asfarasthefolk-lore oftheNoongahburrahs is
concerned. Therefore, ontheauthority ofProfessor Max
Muller, that folk-lore ofanycountry isworth collecting, I
amemboldened tooffermysmall attempt, atacollection, to
thepublic. There areprobably many who,knowing these
legends, would notthink them worth recording;but,on
theother hand, Ihope there aremanywho think, asIdo,
thatweshould try,while there isyet time, togather all
theinformation possible ofarace fastdying out,andthe
origin ofwhich issoobscure. Icannot affect tothink
that these little legends willdomuch toremove that
obscurity, butundoubtedly ascientific andpatient study of
the folk-lore throughout Australia would greatly assist


X Preface
thereto. I,alas,ambutanamateur, moved tomywork
byinterest inthesubject, and intheblacks, ofwhom I
havehadsome experience.
The time iscoming when itwillbeimpossible tomake
evensuch acollection asthis, fortheoldblacks arequickly
dying out,and theyoung ones willprobably think it
beneath thedignity oftheir so-called civilisation even to
remember such old-women's stories. Those who have
themselves attempted thestudy ofanunknown folk-lore
willbeable toappreciate thedifficulties astudent has to
surmount before hecaneven induce those totalkwhohave
theknowledge hedesires. Inthis, asinsomuch else,
thosewho areready tobegarrulous know little.
Ihave confined this little book tothelegends ofthe
Narran tribe, known among themselves asNoongahbur-
rahs. Itisastonishing tofind, within comparatively short
distances, adiversity oflanguage andcustom. Youmay
even findthesameword indifferent tribes bearing atotally
different meaning. Many words, too,have been introduced
which theblacks think areEnglish, and theEnglish think
arenative. Such, forexample, aspiccaninny, and, asfar
asthese outside blacks areconcerned, boomerang isre-
garded asEnglish, their localword being burren;yetnine
outoftenpeople whom youmeet think both arelocal
native words.
Though Ihave written my littlebook intheinterests of
folk-lore, Ihope itwillgain theattention of,andhave
some interest for, children—ofAustralian children,
because they will find stories ofoldfriends among the
Bush birds;and ofEnglish children, because Ihope that


Preface xi
.they willbeglad tomake new friends, andsoestablish
afreetradebetween theAustralian andEnglish nurseries—
wingless, andlaughing birds, inexchange forfairy god-
mothers, andprinces indisguise.
Imust alsoacknowledge mygreat indebtedness tothe
blacks, who,when once theyunderstood what Iwanted to
know, were most ready torepeat tomethelegends—
repeating with theutmost patience, time after time, not
only thelegends, butthenames, that Imight manage to
spellthem soastobeunderstood when repeated. In
particular Ishould liketomention -myindebtedness toPeter
Hippi, king oftheNoongahburrahs ;and toHippitha,
Matah, Barahgurrie, andBeemunny.
Ihave dedicated mybooklet toPeter Hippi, ingrateful
recognition ofhislongand faithful service tomyself and
myhusband, which hasextended, withfewintervals, over
aperiod oftwenty years. He, too, isprobably the last
king oftheNoongahburrahs, who are fastdying out,and
soon their weapons, bartered bythem fortobacco or
whisky, alone will prove that they ever existed. It
seemed tomeapity thatsome attempt should notbe
made tocollect thefolk-lore ofthequickly disappearing
tribe—afolk-lore embodying, probably, the thoughts,
fancies, and beliefs ofthegenuine aboriginal race, and
which, assuch, deserves tobe,indeed, asMax Muller
says,"might beandought tobe,collected inevery partof
theworld."
Thelegends were told tomebytheblacks themselves,
some ofwhom remember thecoming ofMitchellan, asthey
callMajor Mitchell, theexplorer ofthese back creeks.


xii Preface
The oldblacks laugh nowwhen they tellyouhow fright-
ened theirmothers were ofthe firstwheel tracks theysaw.
They would not letthechildren tread onthem, butcare-
fully lifted them over, lest their feetshould break out in
sores, astheyweresupposed todoifthey trodonasnake's
track. Butwith alltheir fear, little didthey realise that
thecoming ofMitchellan wasthebeginning oftheir end,or
that fiftyyears afterwards, from theremnant oftheir once
numerous tribe, would becollected thelegends they told in
those days totheir piccaninnies round their camp-fires, and
those legends used tomake aChristmas booklet forthe
children oftheir white supplanters.
Icanonlyhope thatthewhite children willbeasready
tolisten tothese stories aswere, andindeed are,the little
piccaninnies, andthus thesaleofthisbooklet besuch asto
enable metoadd frocks andtobacco when Igive their
Christmas dinner, asismyyearly custom, totheremnant
oftheNoongahburrahs.

Introduction
Australia makes anappeal tothefancy which isallits
own. When Cortes entered Mexico, inthemost romantic
moment ofhistory, itwasasifmenhadfound theirway to
anew planet, sostrange, solonghidden from Europe was
allthatthey beheld. Still theyfound kings, nobles, pea-
sants, palaces, temples, agreat organised society, fauna and
flora notsovery different fromwhat theyhad leftbehind
inSpain. InAustralia allwas novel, and,while seeming
fresh,wasinestimably old.Thevegetation differs fromours;
themonotonous greygum-trees didnotresemble ourvaried
forests, butwere antique, melancholy, featureless, liketheir
owncontinent ofrare hills, infrequent streams andintermin-
able deserts, conceahng nothing within their wastes, yetpro-
mising asecret. The birdsandbeasts—kangaroo, platypus,
emu—areancient types, rough grotesques ofNature, sketch-
ingasachild draws. The natives were aracewithout a
history, farmore antique thanEgypt, nearer thebeginnings
thananyother people. Their weapons arethemost primi-
tive :those oftheextinct Tasmanians were actually palaeo-
lithic. The soil holds nopottery, thecave walls no
pictures drawn bymenmore advanced;theseahides no
ruined palaces ;nocities areburied intheplains;there is
notatrace ofinscriptions orofagriculture. Theburying-
places contain relics ofmenperhaps even lower than the
existing tribes ;nothing attests thepresence inanyageof
menmore cultivated. Perhaps myriads ofyears havegone
bysince theDelta, orthelands beside Euphrates and

Tigris were asblank ofhuman modification aswas the
whole Australian continent.
Themanners and rites ofthenatives were farthe
most archaic ofallwithwhich weareacquainted. Temples
theyhadnone :noimages ofgods, noaltars ofsacrifice;
scarce anymemorials ofthedead. Their worship atbest
was offered inhymns tosome vague, half-forgotten deity
orFirst Maker ofthings, agod decrepit from ageor
allbutcareless ofhischildren. Spirits wereknown and
feared, but scarcely defined ordescribed. Sympathetic
magic, andperhaps alittle hypnotism, were alltheir
science. Kings and nations theyknew not;theywere
wanderers, houseless and homeless. Custom wasking;
yetcustom was tenacious, irresistible, and ascomplex
inminute details astheetiquette ofSpanish kings, or
theritual oftheFlamens ofRome. Thearchaic intricacies
andtaboos ofthecustoms andregulations ofmarriage might
puzzle amathematician, andmay,when unravelled, explain
thelesscomplicated prohibitions ofatotemism lessan-
tique. Thepeople themselves intheir struggle forexist-
ence had developed great ingenuities. They had the
boomerang and theweet-weet, butnot thebow ;the
throwing stick, butnot,ofcourse, thesword;themessage
stick, butnohieroglyphs ;and their artwasalmost purely
decorative, ingeometrical patterns, notrepresentative. They
deemed themselves akin toallnature, and called cousins
with rainandsmoke, with clouds and sky, aswell aswith
beasts and trees. They were adroit hunters, skilled
trackers, born sportsmen ;theynow ride well, and, for
savages, play cricket fairly. But, being invaded bythe
practical emigrant orthe careless convict, the natives
were notstudied when intheir prime, and science began
toexamine them almost too late.Wehave theworks of

xvi Introduction
noCinderella andnoPuss inBoots. Many stories are
rude aetiological myths ;they explain the habits and
characteristics ofthebirds and beasts, andaccount ina
famihar way fortheorigin ofdeath ("Bahloo, theMoon,
andtheDaens ").The origin offire isalsoaccounted for
inwhatmayalmost becalled ascientific way. Once dis-
covered itis,ofcourse, stolen from theoriginal proprietors.
Asavage cannot believe thatthe firstowners offirewould
give the secret away. The inventors ofthemyth of
Prometheus were ofthesame mind.
Onthewhole thestories, perhaps, most resemble those
from theZulu incharacter, though these represent amuch
higher grade ofcivilisation. The struggle forfood and
water, desperately absorbing, istheperpetual theme, andno
wonder, forthenarrators dwell inadryandthirsty land,
and tillnot,norsow,norkeepanydomestic animals. We
seethecunning ofthesavage inthedevices forhunting,
especially forchasing honey bees. The Rain-magic,
actually practised, isofcurious interest. Inbrief,wehave
pictures ofsavage lifebysavages, romances which aretruly
realistic. Weunderstand thatcondition which Dr.Johnson
didnotthink happy—thestatefromwhich wecame, and
towhichweshall probably return. "Equality," "Liberty,"
"Community ofGoods," allmean savagery, andeven savages,
ifequal, arenotreally free. Custom isthetyrant.
The designs arefrom thesketch-book ofanuntaught
Australian native ;theywere given tomesome years ago
bymybrother, Dr.Lang, ofCorowa. The artist hasa
good dealofspirit inhishunting scenes;histrees arenot
illdone, hisemus andkangaroos arebetter than hismen
and labras. Using ink, apointed stick, and paper, the
artist shows anunwonted freedom ofexecution. Nothing
like thisoccurs inAustralian scratches with asharp stone
onhard wood. Probably noothermember ofhisdying'
raceever illustrated abook.

Dinewan theEmu, andGoomble-
gubbon theBustard
Dinewan theemu, being thelargest bird,wasacknow-
ledged askingbytheother birds. TheGoomblegubbons,.
thebustards, were jealous oftheDinewans. Particularly
wasGoomblegubbon, themother, jealous oftheDinewan
mother. Shewould watch withenvy thehigh flight of
theDinewans, and their swift running. And shealways
fancied that theDinewan mother flaunted hersuperiority
inher face, forwhenever Dinewan alighted nearGoomble-
gubbon, after along, high flight, shewould flapherbig
wings andbegin booing inherpride, nottheloud booing
ofthemale bird, butalittle, triumphant, satisfied booing
noise ofherown,which never failed toirritate Goomble-
gubbon when sheheard it.
Goomblegubbon used towonder howshecould putan
endtoDinewan's supremacy. Shedecided thatshewould
onlybeable todosobyinjuring herwings andchecking
herpower offlight. Butthequestion that troubled her
washow toeffect thisend. Sheknew shewould gain
nothing byhaving aquarrel withDinewan and fighting


2 Australian Tales
her, fornoGoomblegubbon would stand any chance
against aDinewan. There was evidently nothing tobe
gained byanopen fight. Shewould have toeffect her
endbycunning.
One day,when Goomblegubbon saw inthedistance
Dinewan coming towards her, shesquatted down and
doubled inherwings insuch awayastolook asifshe
had none. After Dinewan hadbeen talking toher for
some time, Goomblegubbon -said :"Why doyou not
imitate meanddowithout wings ?Every bird flies.
TheDinewans, tobetheking ofbirds, should dowithout
wings. When allthebirds seethat Icandowithout
wings, they willthink Iamthecleverest birdand they
willmake aGoomblegubbon king."
"Butyouhave wings," saidDinewan.
"No, Ihavenowings." And indeed shelooked asif
herwords were true,sowellwere herwings hidden, aSshe
squatted inthegrass. Dinewan wentaway after awhile,
andthought much ofwhat shehadheard. She talked it
allover with hermate,whowasasdisturbed asshewas.
Theymade uptheirminds that itwould never dotoletthe
Goomblegubbons reign intheir stead, even iftheyhad to
lose theirwings tosave their kingship.
Atlength they decided onthesacrifice oftheir wings.
Dinewan mother showed theexample bypersuading her
mate tocutoffhers with acombo orstone tomahawk,
and then she didthesame tohis.Assoon asthe
operations were over, theDinewan mother lostnotime
inletting Goomblegubbon know what they had done.
She ran swiftly down tothe plain onwhich shehad
leftGoomblegubbon, and, finding her stillsquatting there.


Dinewan theEmu3
shesaid :"See, Ihave followed your example. Ihave
nownowings. They arecutoff."
"Ha !ha !ha!"laughed Goomblegubbon, jumping up
anddancing round with joy atthesuccess ofher plot.
Asshedanced round, shespread outherwings, flapped
them, andsaid :"Ihave taken you in,oldstumpy wings.
Ihavemywings yet.You arefine birds, youDinewans,
tobechosen kings, when you aresoeasily taken in.
Ha !ha !ha!"And, laughing derisively, Goomblegubbon
flapped herwings right infront ofDinewan, whorushed
towards her tochastise her treachery. ButGoomble-
gubbon flewaway, and, alas, thenow wingless Dinewan
could notfollow her.
Brooding over herwrongs, Dinewan walked away,
vowing shewould berevenged. Buthow? That was
thequestion which sheandhermate failed toanswer for
some time. Atlength Dinewan mother thought ofaplan
andprepared atonce toexecute it.Shehid allheryoung
Dinewans buttwo, under abig saltbush. Then she
walked offtoGoomblegubbons' plain with thetwoyoung
ones following her.Asshewalked offtheMorilla ridge,
where herhome was,ontothe plain, shesawGoomble-
gubbon cutfeeding withhertwelve young ones.
After exchanging afewremarks inafriendly manner
withGoomblegubbon, shesaid toher,"Why doyounot
imitate meandonlyhavetwo children ?Twelve aretoo
many tofeed. Ifyoukeep somany they willnever grow
bigbirds liketheDinewans. Thefood thatwould make
bigbirds oftwowould only starve twelve." Goomble-
gubbon said nothing, butshethought itmight beso. It
was impossible todeny that theyoung Dinewans were


4 Australian Tales
much bigger than theyoung Goomblegubbons, and, dis-
contentedly, Goomblegubbon walked away, wondering
whether thesmallness ofheryoung oneswasowing tothe
number ofthem being somuch greater than that ofthe
Dinewans. Itwould begrand, shethought, togrow asbig
astheDinewans. Butsheremembered thetrick shehad
played onDinewan, andshethought thatperhaps shewas
being fooled inherturn. Shelooked back towhere the
Dinewans fed,andasshesawhowmuch bigger thetwo
young oneswere thananyofhers, oncemoremadenvy of
Dinewan possessed her. Shedetermined shewould notbe
outdone. Rather would she kill allheryoung ones but
two. She said,"TheDinewans shall notbetheking birds
oftheplains. TheGoomblegubbons shall replace them.
They shallgrow asbigastheDinewans, and shall keep
theirwings and fly,which now theDinewans cannot do."
Andstraightway Goomblegubbon killed allheryoung ones
buttwo. Then back shecame towhere theDinewans
were still feeding. When Dinewan sawhercoming and
noticed shehadonlytwoyoung ones with her,she called
out :"Where are allyouryoung ones ?"
Goomblegubbon answered, "Ihave killed them, andhave
onlytwo left. Those willhave plenty toeatnow, and will
soongrow asbigasyouryoung ones."
"You cruel mother to.killyour children. Yougreedy
mother. Why, Ihave twelve children and Ifindfood for
them all. Iwould not killoneforanything, noteven ifby
sodoing Icould getbackmywings. There isplenty for
all.Look attheemubushhow itcovers itself with berries
tofeedmybigfamily. Seehow thegrasshoppers come
hopping round, sothatwecancatchthemandfatten onthem."


Dinewan theEmu5
"Butyouhave onlytwochildren."
"Ihave twelve. Iwillgoandbring them toshow you."
Dinewan ranofftohersaltbushwhere shehadhidden her
tenyoung ones. Soon shewas tobeseencoming back.
Running with herneck stretched forward, herhead thrown
backwith pride, andthefeathers ofherboobootella swing-
ingasshe ran,booming outthewhile herqueer throat
noise, theDinewan song ofjoy, thepretty, soft-looking
little ones with their zebra striped skins, running beside
herwhistling their baby Dinewan note.When Dinewan
reached theplacewhere Goomblegubbon was,shestopped
herbooing andsaid inasolemn tone, "Nowyouseemy
words aretrue, Ihave twelve young ones, asIsaid. You
cangaze atmyloved onesandthink ofyour poormurdered
children. Andwhile youdosoIwill tellj'outhefateof
your descendants forever. Bytrickery anddeceit you lost
theDinewans their wings, andnow forevermore, aslong
asaDinewan hasnowings, solong shall aGoomblegubbon
layonlytwoeggsandhave onlytwoyoung ones.Weare
quits now. Youhaveyourwings and Imychildren."
And ever since thattime aDinewan, oremu, hashad
nowings, andaGoomblegubbon, orbustard oftheplains,
haslaidonlytwoeggs inaseason.


The Galah, andOolah theLizard
OoLAH the lizard was tired oflying intliesun, doing
nothing. Sohesaid, "Iwillgoandplay." Hetooii his
boomerangs out,andbegan topractise throwing them.
While hewasdoing soaGalah came up,andstood near,
watching theboomerangs come flying back, forthekindof
boomerangs Oolah was throwing were thebubberahs.
They aresmaller than others, andmore curved, andwhen
they areproperly thrown they return tothethrower, which
other boomerangs donot.
Oolah wasproud ofhaving thegayGalah towatch his
skill. Inhispride hegave thebubberah anextra twist,
andthrew itwith allhismight. Whizz, whizzing through
theairback itcame, hitting, as itpassed her,theGalah on
thetopofherhead, taking both feathers andskin clean off.
TheGalah setupahideous, cawing, croaking shriek, and
flewabout, stopping every fewminutes toknock herhead
ontheground likeamad bird. Oolah was sofrightened
when hesawwhat hehad done, andnoticed thattheblood
wasflowing from theGalah's head, thatheglided away to
hideunder abindeah bush. ButtheGalah sawhim. She
never stopped thehideous noise shewasmaking fora


TheGalah, andOolah theLizard 7
minute, but, still shrieking, followed Oolah. When she
reached thebindeah bush sherushed atOolah, seized him
with herbeak, rolled himonthebush until every bindeah
hadmade ahole inhisskin. Then sherubbed hisskin
withherownbleeding head. "Now then," shesaid,"you
Oolah shall carry bindeahs onyoualways, andthestain of
myblood."
"And you," said Oolah, ashehissed withpainfrom the
tingling oftheprickles, "shall beabald-headed bird as
long asIamaredprickly lizard."
Sotothis day,underneath theGalah's crestyoucan
always find thebald patch which thebubberah ofOolah
firstmade. And inthecountry oftheGalahs arelizards
coloured reddish brown, and covered with spikes like
bindeah prickles.


Bahloo theMoon, andtheDaens
Bahloo themoon looked down attheearth one night,
when hislightwasshining quite brightly, tosee ifanyone
wasmoving. When theearth people were allasleep was
thetime hechose forplaying with histhree dogs. He
called them dogs, buttheearth people called them snakes,
thedeath adder, theblack snake, and the tiger snake.
Ashelooked down ontotheearth, with histhree dogs
beside him, Bahloo sawabout adozen daens, orblack
fellows, crossing acreek. Hecalled tothem saying, "Stop,
Iwantyou tocarrymydogs across thatcreek." But the
black fellows, though they liked Bahloo well, didnotlikehis
dogs, forsometimes when hehadbrought these dogs to
play ontheearth, they had bitten notonly theearth
•dogs but their masters ;and thepoison leftbythe bites
had killed those bitten. Sotheblack fellows said,
"No, Bahloo, weare toofrightened; your dogs might
"bite us.They arenot likeourdogs, whose bitewould
not killus."
Bahloo said,"Ifyoudowhat Iaskyou,when you die
you shallcome tolifeagain, notdieandstayalways where
youareputwhen you aredead. See thispiece ofbark.

Ithrow itintothewater." Andhethrew apiece ofbark
intothecreek. "See itcomes tothetopagain and floats.
That iswhatwould happen toyou ifyouwould dowhat I
askyou :firstunder when you die,thenupagain atonce.
Ifyou willnottakemydogs over,you foolish daens, you
will dielike this," andhethrew astone into thecreek,
which sank tothebottom. "You willbelike that stone,
never riseagain,Wombah daens!"
Buttheblack fellows said,"We cannot dp it,Bahloo.
Wearetoofrightened ofyour dogs."
'
'Iwillcomedown andcarry them overmyself toshow
youthatthey arequite safeandharmless." Anddown he
came, theblack snake coiled round onearm, thetiger snake
round theother, andthedeath adder onhisshoulder, coiled
towards hisneck. Hecarried them over.When hehad
crossed thecreek hepicked upabigstone, andhethrew
itinto thewater, saying, "Now, youcowardly daens, you
would notdowhat I,Bnhloo, asked you todo,and so
forever youhave lost thechance ofrising again after
you die.You will just staywhere youareput, like that
stone does under thewater, andgrow, as itdoes, tobe
part ofthe earth. Ifyouhaddone what Iasked you,
youcould have died asoften asIdie,andhavecome to
lifeasoften asIcome tolife. Butnowyou willonly
beblack fellows while you live,andbones when you are
dead."
Bahloo looked socross, and thethree snakes hissed so
fiercely, that theblack fellows were very glad toseethem
disappear from their sight behind the trees. The black
fellows hadalways been frightened ofBahloo's dogs, and
now they hated them, andthey said,"Ifwecould get

themaway fromBahloo wewould killthem." Andthence-
forth, whenever theysawasnake alone they killed it.But
Bahloo only sent more, forhesaid, "Aslong asthere are
black fellows there shall besnakes toremind them thatthey
would notdowhat Iasked them."


The Origin oftheNarran Lake
OldByamee said tohistwoyoung wives, Birrahgnooloo and
Cunnunbeillee, "Ihave stuck awhite feather between the
hind legsofabee,andamgoing tolet itgoandthen follow
ittoitsnest, that Imay gethoney. While Igoforthe
honey, goyoutwooutandgetfrogs andyams, thenmeet
meatCoorigel Spring, where wewillcamp, forsweet and
clear isthewater there." Thewives, taking their goolays
andyam sticks, went outashetoldthem. Having gone
far,anddug outmany yams and frogs, theywere tired
when they reached Coorigel, and, seeing the cool, fresh
water, theylonged tobathe. But firstthey built abough
shade, andthere lefttheir goolays holding their food,and
theyams and frogs theyhad found. When theircamp
wasready forthecoming ofByamee, whohaving wooed
hiswives with anullah-nullah, keptthem obedient byfear
ofthesame weapon, thenwent the girls tothespring to
bathe. Gladly theyplunged in,having firstdivested them-
selves oftheir goomillahs, which theywere stillyoung
enough towear, andwhich they leftontheground near
thespring. Scarcely were theyenjoying thecool restthe
water gave their hot, tired limbs, when theywere seized and


12 Australian Tales
swallowed bytwokurreahs. Having swallowed the girls,
thekurreahs dived intoanopening inthesideofthespring,
which was theentrance toanunderground watercourse
leading totheNarran River. Through thispassage they
went, taking allthewater from thespring withthem into
theNarran, whose course they also dried astheywent
along.
Meantime Byamee, unwitting thefateofhiswives, was
honey hunting. Hehadfollowed thebeewith thewhite
feather on itforsome distance ;then thebeeflewonto
somebudtha flowers, andwould move nofurther. Byamee
said,"Something hashappened, orthebeewould notstay
hereand refuse tobemoved ontowards itsnest. Imust
gotoCoorigel Spring and see ifmywives are safe.
Something terrible hassurely happened." AndByamee
turned inhaste towards thespring. When hereached there
hesawthebough shed hiswives hadmade, hesawthe
yams theyhaddugfrom theground, andhesawthefrogs,
butBirrahgnooloo andCunnunbeillee hesaw not.He
called aloud forthem. Butnoanswer. Hewent towards
thespring;ontheedge ofithesawthegoomillahs ofhis
wives. Helooked into thespring and,seeing itdry,he
said, "Itisthework ofthekurreahs ;theyhave opened
theunderground passage andgone withmywives tothe
river, andopening thepassage hasdried thespring. Well
doIknow where thepassage joins theNarran, and there
will Iswiftly go." Arming himself with spears and
woggarahs hestarted inpursuit. Hesoon reached the
deep holewhere theunderground channel oftheCoorigel
joined theNarran. There hesawwhat hehadnever
seen before, namely thisdeep hole dry. And hesaid :


Origin oftheNarran Lake 13
"They have emptied theholes astheywent along, taking
thewater with them. Butwellknow Ithedeep holes of
the river. Iwillnot follow thebend, thus trebling the
distance 1have togo,but Iwill cutacross from bighole
tobighole,andbysodoing Imayyetgetahead ofthe
kurreahs." Onswiftly sped Byamee, making short cuts
from bighole tobighole,and histrack isstillmarked by
themorilla ridges that stretch down theNarran, pointing
intowards thedeep holes. Every hole ashecame to it
hefound dry,. until atlasthereached theend ofthe
Narran ;thehole there was still quite wetandmuddy,
thenheknew hewasnear hisenemies, andsoon hesaw
them. Hemanaged toget,unseen, aHttlewayahead of
thekurreahs. Hehidhimself behind abigdheal tree.
Asthekurreahs came near they separated, oneturning to
goinanother direction. Quickly Byamee hurled onespear
after another, wounding both kurreahs, who writhed with
painandlashed their tails furiously, making great hollows
intheground, which thewater theyhadbrought withthem
quickly filled. Thinking they might again escape him,
Byamee drove them from thewater with hisspears, and
then, atclose quarters, hekilled them with hiswoggarahs.
And everafterwards atflood time, theNarran flowed into
this hollow which thekurreahs intheir writhings had
made.
When Byamee saw thatthekurreahs were quite dead,
hecutthem open andtook outthebodies ofhiswives.
They were covered with wet slime, andseemed quite
hfeless ;buthecarried them and laidthem ontwonests of
redants. Then hesatdown atsome little distance and
watched them. The ants quickly covered thebodies.

cleaned them rapidly ofthewet slime, andsoonByamee
noticed themuscles ofthegirls twitching. "Ah,"hesaid,
"there islife,they feelthesting oftheants."
Almost ashespoke came asound asofathunder-clap,
butthesound seemed tocome from theears ofthe girls.
And astheechowasdying away, slowly thegirls rose to
their feet. For amoment they stood apart, adazed
expression ontheir faces. Then they clung together,
shaking asifstricken with adeadly fear. ButByamee
came tothem andexplained how theyhadbeen rescued
from thekurreahs byhim.Hebadethem tobeware of
ever bathing inthedeep holes oftheNarran, lestsuch
holes bethehaunt ofkurreahs.
Then hebade them look atthewater now atBoogira,
andhesaid :
"Soon will theblack swans find theirway here, the
pelicans and theducks;where there wasdryland and
stones inthepast, inthefuture there willbewater and
water-fowl, from henceforth;when theNarran runs itwill
runinto this hole,andbythespreading ofitswaters willa

pass, astheNarran Lake shows, with itslarge sheet of
water, spreading formiles, thehome ofthousands ofwild

Gooloo theMagpie, andthe
Wahroogah
Gooloo was avery oldwoman, and avery wicked old
woman too, asthis story will tell. During allthepast
season, when thegrass was thick with seed, shehad
gathered much doonburr, which shecrushed intomeal as
shewanted itforfood. Sheused tocrush itonabig flat
stone with small flatstones—thebigstone was called a
dayoorl. Gooloo ground agreat dealofthedoonburr seed
toputaway forimmediate use,therestshekeptwhole, to
beground asrequired.
Soon aftershehadfinished herfirstgrinding, aneighbour-
ingtribe came along andcamped nearwhere shewas.
Onedaythemen allwent outhunting, leaving thewomen
andthechildren inthecamp. After themenhadbeen
gone alittle while, Gooloo themagpie came totheircamp
totalk tothewomen. She said, "Why doyounotgo
hunting too?Many arethenests ofthewurranunnahs
round here, and thick isthehoney inthem. Many and
ripe arethebumbles hanging nowonthebumble trees;

the fruit oftheguiebets. Yetyou sitinthecamp and
hunger, untilyour husbands return with thedinewan and
bowrah they have gone forth toslay. Go,women, and
gather oftheplenty thatsurrounds you. Iwilltake care
ofyour children, the littleWahroogahs."
"Your words arewise," thewomen said. "Itisfoolish
tosithereandhunger, when near athandyams arethick
intheground, andmany fruits waitbuttheplucking. We
willgoand fillquickly ourcomebees andgoolays, butour
children wewilltakewith us."
"Not so,"said Gooloo, "foolish indeed wereyou todo
that. Youwould tirethe little feetofthose that run,and
tireyourselves with theburden ofthose thathave tobe
carried. No,take forth yourcomebees andgoolays empty
thatyemaybring back themore. Many arethespoils
thatwaitonly thehand ofthegatherer. Look ye, Ihave
adurrie made offresh doonburr seed, cooking justnowon

andswiftly shall Imake them another. They shall eatand

tomenow, theyhunger fordurrie, andwell will Ifeed
them. Haste yethen, thatyemayreturn intime tomake
ready the fires forcooking themeat your husbands will
bring. Glad willyourhusbands bewhen they seethatye
have filledyour goolays andcomebees with fruits, andyour
wirrees withhoney. Haste ye, Isay,anddowell."
Having listened tothewords ofGooloo, thewomen
decided todoasshe said, and,leaving their children with
her,they started forth withempty comebees, andarmed
withcombos, withwhich tochop outthebees' nests and
opossums, andwithyam sticks todigupyams.


Gooloo theMagpie 17
When thewomen hadgone, Gooloo gathered thechildren
round herand fedthem with durrie, hotfrom the coals.
Honey too,shegave them, andbumbles which shehad
buried toripen. When theyhad eaten, shehurried them
offtoherrealhome, built inahollow tree, alittle distance
away fromwhere shehadbeen cooking herdurrie. Into-
herhouse shehurriedly thrust them, followed quickly her-
self,andmade allsecure. Here shefedthem again, butthe
children hadalready satisfied their hunger, andnowthey
missed their mothers andbegan tocry. Their crying
reached theears ofthewomen astheywere returning to
theircamp. Quickly theycame atthesound which isnot
good inamother's ears. Astheyquickened their steps
theythought howsoon the spoils that layheavy intheir
comebees would comfort their children. Andhappy they,
themothers, would feelwhen they fedtheWahroogahs with
the dainties they had gathered forthem. Soon they
reached thecamp, but, alas !where were their children ?
Andwhere wasGooloo themagpie ?
"They areplaying wahgoo," they said, "andhave
hidden themselves."
Themothers hunted allround forthem, andcalled aloud
thenames oftheir children andGooloo. Butnoanswer
could theyhearandnotrace could they find. And yet
everynowandthen theyheard thesound ofchildren wail-
ing. Butseek astheywould theyfound them not. Then
loudly wailed themothers themselves fortheir lostWah-
roogahs, and, wailing, returned tothecamp towait the
coming oftheblack fellows. Heavy were their hearts, and
sadwere their faceswhen theirhusbands returned. They
hastened totelltheblack fellows when they came,how
B

Australian Tales
Gooloo hadpersuaded them togohunting, promising ifthey
•didsothatshewould feedthehungry Wahroogahs, andcare
forthem while theywere away, but—andherethey wailed
again fortheir poorWahroogahs. They toldhow they
hadlistened toherwords andgone ;truth hadshetoldof
theplenty round, their comebees andgoolays were fullof
fruits and spoils theyhad gathered, but, alas, theycame
home withthem laden only tofind their children goneand
Gooloo gone too.Andnotrace could they find ofeither,
though attimes theyheard asound asofchildren wailing.
Then wroth were themen, saying :"What mothers are
yetoleave youryoung toastranger, and thatstranger a
Gooloo, ever atreacherous race ?Didwenotgoforth to

Themenhunted thebush round formiles, butfound no
trace ofthe lostWahroogahs, though they tooheard at
times anoise asofchildren's voices wailing.
Butbeyond thewailing which echoed inthemothers'
€ars forever,notracewasfound ofthechildren. Formany
days thewomen satinthecamp mourning fortheir lost
Wahroogahs, and beating their heads because they had
listened tothevoice ofGooloo.


TheWeeoombeens andthe
Piggiebillah
Two Weeoombeen brothers went out'hunting. One
brother wasmuch younger than theother andsmaller, so
when they sighted anemu, theelder one said tothe
younger :"Youstay quietly hereanddonotmake anoise,
orPiggiebillah, whose campwepassed justnow, willhear
youand steal theemu ifIkill it.He issostrong. I'll
goonandtrytokilltheemuwith this stone." The little
Weeoombeen watched hisbigbrother sneak uptotheemu,
crawling, along almost flat,ontheground. Hesawhim
getquite close totheemu, then spring upquickly and
throw thestone withsuch anaccurate aim astokillthe
birdonthespot. The little brother was sorejoiced that
heforgot hisbrother's caution, andhecalled aloud inhis


20 Australian Tales
joy. ThebigWeeoombeen looked round andgavehima
warning sign, buttoo late, Piggiebillah hadheard thecry
andwashastening towards them. Quickly bigWeeoom-
been lefttheemuandjoined his little brother.
Piggiebillah when hecame up,said :"What haveyou
found ?"
"Nothing," said thebigWeeoombeen, "nothing but
some mistletoe berries."
"Itmust have been something more than that, oryour
little brother would nothave called outsoloudly."
LittleWeeoombeen wassoafraid thatPiggiebillah would
find theiremuandtake it,thathesaid :"Ihitalittle bird
with astone, and Iwasglad Icould throw sostraight."
"Itwasnocryforthekilling ofalittle bird orforthe
finding ofmistletoe berries that Iheard. Itwas for
something much more than either, oryouwould nothave
called outsojoyfully. Ifyoudonot tellme atonce I
will killyouboth."
TheWeeoombeen brothers were frightened, forPiggie-
billah was agreat fighter andvery strong, sowhen they
sawhewas really angry, theyshowed himthedeademu.
"Justwhat Iwant formysupper," hesaid,andsosay-
ing,dragged itaway tohisowncamp. TheWeeoombeens
followed himandeven helped him tomake afiretocook
theemu, hoping bysodoing togetashare given tothem.
ButPiggiebillah would notgivethem any;hesaidhemust
have itallforhimself.
Angry and disappointed, theWeeoombeens marched
straight offand toldsome black fellows who lived near,
that Piggiebillah hadafine fatemujustcooked forsupper.
Upjumped theblack fellows, seized their spears, bade


TheWeeoombeens 21
theWeeoombeens quickly leadthem toPiggiebillah's camp,
promising them forsodoing, ashare oftheemu.
When theywere within range ofspear shot, theblack
fellows formed acircle, took aim,andthrew their spears at
Piggiebillah. Asthespears fellthick onhim, sticking out
allover him, Piggiebillah cried aloud :"Bingehlah, Bin-
gehlah. You canhave it,you canhave it." Butthe
black fellows didnot desist until Piggiebillah was too
wounded even tocryout ;then they lefthimamass of
spears and turned tolook fortheemu. But totheir
surprise theyfound itnot. Then forthe firsttimethey
missed theWeeoombeens.
Looking round theysaw their tracks going towhere the
emu had evidently been ;then theysaw thatthey had
dragged theemu totheir nyunnoo, which was ahumpy
made ofgrass.
When theWeeoombeens sawtheblack fellows coming,
theycaught hold oftheemuanddragged ittoabighole
theyknew of,with abigstone atitsentrance, which stone
onlytheyknew thesecret ofmoving. Theymoved the
stone, gottheemuandthemselves intothehole, andthe
stone inplace again before theblack fellows reached the
place.
The black fellows tried tomove thestone, butcould
not. Yettheyknew that theWeeoombeens must have
done so,fortheyhadtracked them right uptoit,andthey
could hear thesound oftheir voices ontheother sideof it.
They sawtherewasacrevice oneither side ofthestone,
between itandtheground. Through these crevices they
drove intheir spears, thinking theymust surely killthe
brothers. But theWeeoombeens toohad seen these


22 Australian Tales
crevices andhadanticipated thespears, sotheyhadplaced
thedeademu before them toactasashield. And into its
bodywere driven thespears oftheblack fellows intended
fortheWeeoombeens.
Having driven thespears well in,theblack fellows went
offtogethelp tomove thestone, butwhen theyhadgone
alittlewaythey heard theWeeoombeens laughing. Back
theycame andspeared again, andagain started forhelp,
only asthey left tohear once more thelaughter ofthe
brothers.
TheWeeoombeens finding their laughter only brought
back theblack fellows toafresh attack, determined tokeep
quiet, which, after thenext spearing, they did.
Quite sure,when theyheard their spear shots followed
bj'neither conversation nor laughter, thattheyhad killed
theWeeoombeens atlast, theblack fellows hurried away
tobring back thestrength andcunning ofthecamp, to
remove thestone.
TheWeeoombeens hurriedly discussed what plan they
hadbetter adopt toelude theblack fellows, forwellthey
knew thatshould they evermeet anyofthem again they
would bekilled without mercy. And asthey talked they
satisfied theirhunger byeating some oftheemu flesh.
After awhile theblack fellows returned, andsoonwas
thestone removed from theentrance. Some ofthem crept
intothehole, where, totheir surprise, theyfound only the
remains oftheemuandnotrace oftheWeeoombeens. As
thosewhohadgone infirst, crept outand told ofthedis-
appearance oftheWeeoombeens, others, incredulous ofsuch
astory, crept intofind itconfirmed. They searched
round fortracks;seeing that their spears were allinthe

emu itseemed tothem probable theWeeoombeens had
escaped alive, but ifso,whither theyhadgone their tracks-
would show. Butsearch astheywould notracks could
they find. Allthey could seewere two little birds which
satonabush near thehole, watching theblack fellows all
thetime. The little birds flewround thehole sometimes,
butnever away, always returning totheirbushandseeming
tobediscussing thewhole affair ;butwhat they saidthe
black fellows could notunderstand. Butastimewenton
andnosignwaseverfound oftheWeeoombeens, theblack
fellows became sure thatthebrothers hadturned into the
little white-throated birds which had satonthebushby
the hole, so,they supposed, toescape their vengeance..
And ever afterwards the little white-throats were called
Weeoombeens. And thememory ofPiggiebillah isper-
petuated byasortofporcupine anteater, which bears his-
name, andwhose skin iscovered Closely with miniature
spears sticking allover it.


Bootoolgah theCrane andGoonur
theKangaroo Rat, theFireMakers
Inthedayswhen Bootoolgah, thecrane, married Goonur,
thekangaroo rat,therewasnofireintheir country. They
had toeattheir foodraworjustdry itinthesun. One
daywhen Bootoolgah wasrubbing two pieces ofwood
together, hesawafaint spark sent forth and then a
slight smoke. "Look," hesaid toGoonur, "seewhat
comes when Irubthese pieces ofwood together—smoke !
Would itnotbegood ifwecould make fire forourselves
withwhich tocookourfood, soasnottohave towait for
thesuntodry it?"
Goonur looked, and, seeing thesmoke, she said :
"Great indeed would bethedaywhenwecould make
fire. Split your stick, Bootoolgah, and place inthe
opening bark and grass that even one spark may
kindle alight." And hearing wisdom inherwords,
even asshe said Bootoolgah did.And lo !aftermuch
rubbing, from theopening came asmall flame. For as
Goonur had said itwould, thespark litthe grass, the
bark smouldered andsmoked, and soBootoolgah the


The FireMakers 25
crane, andGoonur thekangaroo rat,discovered the art
offiremaking.
"This wewillkeep secret," they said,"from allthe
tribes. When wemake afire tocook ourfishwewillgo
intoaBingahwingul scrub. There willwemake afire
andcook ourfood insecret.We willhideour firesticks
intheopen-mouthed seeds oftheBingahwinguls ;one fire
stickwewillcarry always hidden inourcomebee."
Bootoolgah andGoonur cooked thenext fishtheycaught,
andfound itvery good. When theywent back tothe
camp they tooksome oftheir cooked fishwith them. The
blacks noticed itlooked quite different from theusual sun-
dried fish, sotheyasked :"What didyou tothat fish?"
"Let itlieinthesun," said they.
"Not so,"saidtheothers.
Butthatthe fishwassundried Bootoolgah andGoonur
persisted. Daybydaypassed, and after catching their
fish, these twoalways disappeared, returning with their
foodlooking quite different from that oftheothers. At
last,being unable toextract anyinformation from them, it
wasdetermined bythetribe towatch them. Boolooral,
thenight owl,andQuarrian, theparrot, were appointed to
follow thetwowhen they disappeared, towatch where they
went, and find outwhat they did. Accordingly, after the
next fishwere caught, when Bootoolgah andGoonur
gathered uptheir share andstarted forthebush, Boolooral
andQuarrian followed ontheir tracks. They sawthem
disappear intoaBingahwingul scrub, where they lostsight
ofthem. Seeing ahigh treeontheedge ofthescrub, they
climbed up it,andfrom there theysaw allthatwas tobe
seen. They sawBootoolgah andGoonur throw down


26 Australian Tales
their load offish,open their comebee andtake from ita
stick, which stick,when theyhadblown upon it,they laid
inthemidst ofaheap ofleaves and twigs, and atonce
from thisheap theysawaflame leap,which flame the fire
makers fedwith bigger sticks. Then, astheflame died
down, theysawthetwoplace- their fish intheashes that
remained from theburnt sticks. Then back tothecamp
oftheir tribes went Boolooral andQuarrian, back with the
news oftheir discovery. Great wasthe talkamongst the
blacks, andmany thequeries astohow togetpossession
ofthecomebee withthefirestick init,when nextBootoolgah
andGoonur came intothecamp. Itwas atlength decided
tohold acorrobboree, and itwas tobeoneonascale
notoften seen, probably never before bytheyoung ofthe
tribes. Thegreybeards proposed tosoastonish Bootoolgah
andGoonur astomake them forget toguard their precious
comebee. Assoon astheywere intent onthecorrobboree
and offguard, some onewas toseize thecomebee, steal the
firestick and start fires forthegood ofall.Most ofthem
hadtasted thecooked fishbrought into thecamp bythe
firemakers and, having found itgood, hungered for it.
Beeargah, thehawk, was told tofeign sickness, totieup
hishead, andtoliedown nearwherever thetwo sattowatch
thecorrobboree. Lying nearthem, hewas towatch them
allthetime,andwhen theywerelaughing andunthinking of
anything butthespectacle before them, hewas tosteal the
comebee. Having arranged their plan ofaction, they all
prepared forabigcorrobboree. They sentword toall
thesurrounding tribes, asking them toattend, especially
they begged theBralgahs tocome, asthey were cele-
brated fortheir wonderful dancing, which was sowonder-

fulastobemost likely toabsorb theattention ofthe
firemakers.
Allthetribes agreed tocome, andsoon allwereengaged
ingreat preparations. Each determined tooutdo the
other inthequaintness andbrightness oftheir painting for
thecorrobboree. Each tribe asthey arrived gained great
applause ;never before hadtheyoung people seen somuch
diversity incolouring and design. Beeleer, theblack
ACORROBBOREE
cockatoo tribe,came with bright splashes oforange-red on
their black skins. The Pelicans came asacontrast,
almost pure white, only atouch hereand there oftheir
black skinshowing where thewhite paint hadrubbed off.
The Black Divers came intheir black skins, butthese
polished toshine like satin. Then came theMillears, the
beauties oftheKangaroo Ratfamily, whohad theirhome
onthe Morillas. After them came theBuckandeer or
Native Cat tribe, painted indull colours, butinallsorts of
patterns. Mairas orPaddymelons came too inhaste to
take part inthegreat corrobboree. After them, walking
slowly, came theBralgahs, looking talland dignified as
they helduptheir redheads, painted soincontrast totheir


28 Australian Tales
French-grey bodies, which theydeemed toodullacolour,
unbrightened, forsuch agay occasion. Amongst the
many tribes there, toonumerous tomention, were therose
andgrey painted Galahs, thegreen andcrimson painted
Billai :most brilliant were they with their bodies grass
green andtheir sides bright crimson, soafterwards gaining
them thename ofcrimson wings. The bright little
Gidgereegahs came too.
Great wasthegathering thatBootoolgah, thecrane, and
Goonur, thekangaroo rat,found assembled asthey hurried
ontothescene. Bootoolgah hadwarned Goonur thatthey
must onlybespectators, andtakenoactive part inthe
corrobboree, astheyhadtoguard theircomebee. Obedient
tohisadvice, Goonur seated herself beside himandslung
thecomebee over herarm. Bootoolgah warned hertobe
careful andnotforget shehad it.Butasthecorrobboree
went on,soabsorbed didshebecome thatsheforgot the
comebee, which slipped fromherarm. Happily, Bootoolgah
saw itdoso,replaced it,andbade hertake heed, so
baulking Beeargah, whohadbeen about toseize it,forhis
vigilance wasunceasing, and,deeming himsickalmost unto
death, thetwowhom hewaswatching tooknoheed ofhim.
Back hecrouched, moaning asheturned, butkeeping ever
aneyeonGoonur. And soonwasherewarded. Now
came theturnoftheBralgahs todance, andevery eyebut
thatofthewatchful onewas fixedonthem asslowly they
came into the ring. First they advanced, bowed and
retired, thenthey repeated what theyhaddone before, and
again, each time getting faster and faster intheir move-
ments, changing theirbows into pirouettes, craning their
longnecks andmaking such antics astheywent through


The FireMakers 29
thefigures oftheir dance, andreplacing their dignity with
such grotesqueness, astomake their large audience shake
with laughter, theythemselves keeping throughout alltheir
grotesque measures asolemn air,which onlyseemed to
heighten theeffect oftheir antics.
Andnowcame thechance ofBeeargah thehawk. In
theexcitement ofthemoment Goonur forgot thecomebee, as
didBootoolgah. They joined inthemirthful applause of
thecrowd, andGoonur threw herself back helpless with
laughter. Asshe didsothecomebee slipped from her
arm. Then upjumped thesickman from behind her,
seized thecomebee with hiscombo, cut itopen, snatched
forth thefirestick, setfiretotheheap ofgrass ready near
where hehad lain,and allbefore thetworealised their loss.
When they discovered theprecious comebee wasgone, up

Weedah theMocking Bird
Weedah wasplaying agreat trickontheblack fellows who
lived near him.Hehad built himself anumber ofgrass
nyunnoos, more than twenty. Hemade fires before each,
tomake itlook asifsomeonelived inthenyunnoos. First
hewould gointoonenyunnoo, orhumpy, andcrylikea
baby, then toanother andlaugh likeachild, then inturn
ashewent theround ofthehumpies hewould singHkea
maiden, corrobboree likeaman, calloutinaquavering
voice likeanoldman, and inashrill voice likeanold
woman ;infact, imitate any sort ofvoice hehad ever
heard, and imitate them soquickly insuccession thatany
onepassing would think therewasagreat crowd ofblacks
inthatcamp. His object was toentice asmany strange
black fellows into hiscamp ashecould, oneatatime ;then
hewould killthem andgradually gain thewhole country
round forhisown. Hischance waswhen hemanaged to
getasingle black fellow into hiscamp, which hevery often
did,thenbyhiscunning healways gained hisendandthe
black fellow's death. Thiswashowheattained that end.
Ablack fellow, probably separated from hisfellows inthe
excitement ofthechase, would bereturning home alone;


Weedah theMocking Bird 31
passing within earshot ofWeedah's camp hewould hear
thevarious voices andwonder what tribe could bethere.
Curiosity would induce him tocome near. Hewould
probably peer into thecamp, and, only seeing Weedah
standing alone, would advance towards him. Weedah
would bestanding atalittle distance from abigglowing
fire,where hewould wait until thestrange black fellow
came quite close tohim. Then hewould askhimwhat he
wanted. The stranger would sayhehadheard many
voices andhadwondered what tribe itcould be,sohad
come near tofind out.Weedah would say, "Butonly I
amhere.How couldyouhave heard voices ?See ;look
round;Iamalone." Bewildered, thestranger would look
round andsay inapuzzled tone ofvoice :"Where are
they allgone ?AsIcame Iheard babies crying, men calling,
andwomen laughing; many voices Iheard butyouonly I
see."
"And only Iamhere. Thewindmust have stirred the
branches ofthebalah trees, andyoumust have thought it
wasthewailing ofchildren, thelaughing ofthegouggour-
gahgah youheard, andthought itthelaughter ofwomen,
andmine must have been thevoice asofmen thatyou
heard. Alone inthebush, astheshadows fall,amanbreeds
strange fancies. Seebythe light ofthis fire,where are
your fancies now ?Nowomen laugh, nobabies cry,only
I,Weedah, talk." AsWeedah wastalking hekeptedging
thestranger towards the fire ;when theywere quite close
toit,heturned swiftly, seized him ,andthrew himright into
themiddle oftheblaze. This scene was repeated time
after time, until atlasttheranks oftheblack fellows living
round thecamp ofWeedah, began togetthin.

Mullyan, theeagle hawk, determined tofathom the
mystery, forasyettheblack fellows hadnoclueastohow
orwhere their friends had disappeared. Mullyan, when
Beeargah, hiscousin, returned tohiscamp nomore, made
uphismind togetonhistrack andfollow it,until atlength
hesolved themystery. After following thetrack ofBeear-
gah, ashehadchased thekangaroo towhere hehad slain
it,onhefollowed hishomeward trail. Over stony ground
hetracked him,andthrough sand, across plains, andthrough
scrub. Atlastinascrub and stillonthetrack ofBeeargah,
heheard thesounds ofmany voices, babies crying, women
singing, men talking. Peering through thebush, finding
thetrack tookhimnearer thespotwhence came thesounds,
hesaw thegrass humpies. "Who canthesebe?" he
thought. The track ledhim right into thecamp, where
aloneWeedah was tobeseen. Mullyan advanced towards
himandasked where were thepeople whose voices hehad
heard ashecame through thebush.
Weedah said :"How can Itellyou ? Iknow ofno
people;Ilivealone."
"But," saidMullyan theeagle hawk,"Iheard babies
crying, women laughing, andmen talking, notonebut
many."
"And Ialoneamhere. Askofyour earswhat trick they
played you, orperhaps your eyes failyounow. Canyou
seeanybutme?Look foryourself."
"And if,asindeed itseems, youonly arehere,what did
youwithBeeargah mycousin, andwhere aremyfriends ?
Many aretheir trails that Iseecoming into thiscamp, but
none going out.And ifyoualone livehereyoualone can

alone, andknows naught ofyour friends." ButasWeedah
wastalking hewas carefully edging Mullyan towards the
fire.
Mullyan, theeagle hawk, too,was cunning, andnot
easy totrap.Hesawablazing fire infront ofhim,he
sawthetrack ofhisfriend behind him,hesawWeedah
wasedging himtowards the fire,and itcame tohim ina

mighty gripMullyan theeaglehawk seized him, saying,,
"Even asyouserved Beeargah thehawk,mycousin, and
myfriends, sonowserve Iyou," And right intothemiddle
oftheblazing firehethrew him. Then heturned home-
wards inhaste, totelltheblack fellows thathehadsolved
thefateoftheir friends, which hadsolongbeen amystery.
When hewassome distance from theWeedah's camp, he
heard thesound ofathunder clap. But itwasnotthunder

burst, outfrom hisremains had risen abird,Weedah, the

TheGwlneeboos theRedbreasts
GwiNEEBOO andGoomai, thewater rat,weredown atthe
creek one day, getting mussels forfood, when, totheir
astonishment, akangaroo hopped right into thewater
beside them. Well theyknew thathemust beescaping
from hunters, whowere probably pressing him close. So
Gwineeboo quickly seized heryam stick, andknocked the
kangaroo onthehead :hewascaught fastintheweeds in
thecreek, socould notescape. When thetwooldwomen
had killed thekangaroo they hid itsbody under theweeds
inthecreek, fearing totake itoutandcook itstraight
away, lestthehunters should come upandclaim it.The
little sonofGwineeboo watched them from thebank.
After having hidden thekangaroo, thewomen picked up
their mussels andstarted fortheir camp, when upcame the
hunters, Quarrian andGidgereegah, whohadtracked the
kangaroo right tothecreek.
Seeing thewomen they said :"Didyouseeakan-
garoo ?
Thewomen answered :"No.Wesawnokangaroo."
"That isstrange, forwehave tracked itright upto
here."


36 Australian Tales
"Wehave seen nokangaroo. See,wehavebeen dig-
ging outmussels forfood. Come toourcamp, andwewill
giveyousomewhen they arecooked."
Theyoung men, puzzled intheir minds, followed the
women totheir camp, andwhen themussels were cooked
thehunters joined the oldwomen attheir dinner. The
littleboywould noteatthemussels;hekeptcrying tohis
mother, "Gwineeboo, Gwineeboo. Iwant kangaroo. I
want kangaroo. Gwineeboo. Gwineeboo.''
"There," saidQuarrian. "Your littleboyhasseen the
kangaroo, andwants some;itmust beheresomewhere."
"Oh, no.He cries foranything hethinks of,some
days forkangaroo ;he isonly alittle boy,anddoes not
know what hewants," said oldGwineeboo. But still the
child kept saying, "Gwineeboo. Gwineeboo. Iwant
kangaroo. Iwant kangaroo." Goomai wassoangry with
littleGwineeboo forkeeping onasking forkangaroo, and
thereby making theyoung men suspicious, thatshe hithim
sohard onthemouth tokeep him quiet, that theblood
came, andtrickled down hisbreast, staining itred.When
shesaw this, oldGwineeboo grew angry inherturn,and
hitoldGoomai, who returned theblow, and soafight
began, morewords than blows, sothenoisewas great, the
women fighting, little Gwineeboo crying, notquiteknowing
whether hewas crying because Goomai had hithim,
because hismother was fighting, orbecause hestillwanted
kangaroo.
Quarrian said toGidgereegah. "They have thekan-
garoo somewhere hidden;letusslipawaynow inthecon-
fusion. We will only hide, thencome back inalittle
while, andsurprise them."


TheGwineeboos theRedbreasts 37
They went quietly away, andassoon asthetwowomen
noticed theyhadgone, they ceased fighting, anddetermined
tocook thekangaroo. They watched thetwoyoung men
outofsight, andwaited some time soastobesure that
theywere safe. Then down they hurried togetthekan-
garoo. They dragged itout,andwere justmaking abig
fireonwhich tocook it,when upcame Quarrian and
Gidgereegah, saying:
"Ah !wethought so.Youhadourkangaroo allthe
time;littleGwineeboo was right."
"Butwekilled it,"saidthewomen.
"Butwehunted ithere," said themen,andsosaying
caught hold ofthekangaroo anddragged itaway tosome
distance, where theymade afireandcooked it.Goomai,
Gwineeboo, andher littleboywent over toQuarrian and
Gidgereegah, andbegged forsome ofthemeat, butthe
young menwould givethem none, though Htttle Gwineeboo
cried piteously forsome. Butno ;they said theywould
rather throw what they didnotwant tothehawks than
give ittothewomen orchild. Atlast, seeing that there
wasnohope oftheir getting any, thewomen went away.
They built abigdardurr forthemselves, shutting themselves
andthehttleboyupin it.Then they began singing a
songwhich was toinvoke astorm todestroy their enemies,
forsonow they considered Quarrian and Gidgereegah.
Forsome timetheychanted :
"Moogaray, Moogaray, May,May,
Eehu, Eehu, Doongarah."
First theywould begin very slowly and softly, gradually
getting quicker and louder, until atlength they almost

shrieked itout. Thewords they said meant, "Come
hailstones;come wind ;come rain;come lightning."
While theywere chanting, littleGwineeboo kept crying,
andwould notbecomforted. Soon came afewbigdrops
ofrain, then abigwind, and asthat lulled, more rain.
Then came thunder and lightning, the airgrew bitterly
cold,and there came apitiless hailstorm, hailstones bigger
than aduck's egg fell, cutting theleaves from thetrees
andbruising their bark. Gidgereegah andQuarrian came
running over tothedardurr andbegged thewomen tolet
them in.
"No," shrieked Gwineeboo above thestorm, "there
wasnokangaroo meat forus :there isnodardurr shelter
foryou. Ask shelter ofthehawkswhom yefed." The
menbegged tobeletin,saidtheywould hunt again and
getkangaroo forthewomen, notonebutmany. "No,"
again shrieked thewomen. "Youwould noteven listen (o

women :
"Moogaray, Moogaray, May,May,

First theywere changed into birds andafterwards into

Butnoonewould givehimanything. Heflew intoarage

thattheoldmanhadnoeyes, though hehadseemed tobe

thought itvery strange and still feltrather frightened,
though Mooroonumildah seemed hospitable andkind, forhe
gaveWurrunnah, whom hesaid looked hungry, abark
wirree filled with honey, toldhimwhere hiscamp was,and
gavehimleave togothere andstaywith him.Wurrunnah
took thehoney andturned asiftogotothecamp, butwhen
hegotoutofsight hethought itwiser toturn inanother
direction. Hejourneyed onforsome time, until hecame
toalarge lagoon, where hedecided tocamp. Hetook a
long drink ofwater, andthen laydown tosleep. When
hewoke inthemorning, helooked towards thelagoon, but
sawonly abig plain. Hethought hemust bedreaming;
herubbed hiseyesandlooked again.
"This isastrange country," hesaid. "First Imeet a

"Now Iamright," hesaid. "Ishall getsome poles

Hequickly cutthepoles hewanted, stuck themupasa

This strange object cried out :"IamBulgahnunnoo,"
insuch aterrifying tone thatWurrunnah dropped thebark,,
picked uphisweapons andranaway ashard ashecould,
quite forgetting thestorm. Hisoneideawas togetasfar

Wurrunnah saw that littlewould avail himtheexcuse that
hehad killed theblack fellow inmistake foranemu ;his
onlyhope layinflight. Once more hetook tohisheels,
hardly daring tolookround forfearhewould seeanenemy

which hewasalmost into before hesjiw it;hehadonly
been thinking ofdanger behind him,unheeding what was
before him.
However, hehadnothing tofear inthecamp hereached
sosuddenly, forin itwere onlyseven young girls. They
didnotlook very terrifying, infact,seemed more startled
thanhewas. They were quite friendly towards himwhen
theyfound thathewasalone andhungry. They gavehim
foodandallowed him tocamp there that night. Heasked
themwhere the rest oftheir tribe were, andwhat their
name was. They answered that theirnamewasMeamei,
and that their tribe were inafarcountry. They had
onlycome tothiscountry toseewhat itwashke ;they
would stay forawhile andthen return whence theyhad
come.
ThenextdayWurrunnah made afresh start,andJeftthe
camp oftheMeamei, asifhewere leaving forgood. But
hedetermined tohide nearandwatch what they did,and
ifhecould getachance hewould steal awifefromamongst

throwing theiryam sticks onone side, toenjoy afeast,
forthese antswere esteemed bythem agreat delicacy.
While thesisters were busy attheir feast,Wurrunnah
sneaked uptotheiryam sticks and stole two ofthem;
then, taking thesticks with him,sneaked back tohishiding-
place. When atlength theMeamei had satisfied their
appetites, theypicked uptheir sticks andturned towards
theircamp again. Butonly fivecould find their sticks;
sothose fivestarted off,leaving theother twotofind theirs,
supposing theymust besomewhere near, and, finding them,
theywould soon catchthem up.Thetwo girls hunted all
round theants' nests, butcould findnosticks. Atlast,
when their backs were turned towards him,Wurrunnah
crept outandstuck the lostyam sticks near together in
theground ;then he slipt back into hishiding-place.
When thetwo girls turned round, there infront ofthem
theysaw their sticks. With acryofjoyful surprise they
rantothemandcaught hold ofthem topullthem outof
theground, inwhich they were firmly stuck. Asthey
were doing so,outfrom hishiding-place jumped Wurrunnah.
Heseized both girls round their waists, holding them
tightly, They struggled andscreamed, buttonopurpose.
There were none near tohear them, and themore they
struggled thetighter Wurrunnah heldthem. Finding their
screams andstruggles invainthey quietened atlength, and
thenWurrunnah toldthem nottobeafraid, hewould take
care ofthem. Hewas lonely, hesaid, andwanted two
wives. They must come quietly with him,andhewould
begood tothem. Buttheymust doashetoldthem. If
theywere notquiet, hewould swiftly quieten them with his
moorillah. But iftheywould come quietly withhimhe


Meamei theSeven Sisters 45
would begood tothem. Seeing thatresistance was useless,
thetwoyoung girls complied with hiswish, and travelled
quietly onwith him. They toldhim thatsome day their
tribe would come and steal them back again ;toavoid
which hetravelled quickly onandon still further, hoping
toelude allpursuit. Some weeks passed, and, out-
wardly, thetwoMeamei seemed settled down totheirnew
life,and quite content in it,though when theywere alone
together they often talked oftheir sisters, andwondered
what theyhaddonewhen they realised their loss. They
wondered ifthe fivewere still hunting forthem, or
whether they hadgone back totheir tribe togetassist-
ance. That theymight beintime forgotten and leftwith
Wurrunnah forever,theynever once foramoment thought.
Onedaywhen theywerecamped Wurrunnah said :"This
firewillnotburn well. Goyoutwoand getsome bark
from those twopine trees over there."
"No," they said,"wemust notcutpine bark. Ifwe
did,youwould never more seeus."
"Go !Itellyou, cutpine bark. Iwant it.Seeyou

"Ifwego,Wurrunnah, weshall never return. You

TheMeamei went, taking withthem their combos with
which tocutthebark. Theywent each toadifferent tree,
andeach, with astrong hit,drove hercombo intothebark.

TheCookooburrahs and the
Goolahgool
GooGARH, theiguana, wasmarried toMoodai, theopossum
andCookooburrah, thelaughing jackass. Cookooburrah
was themother ofthree sons, onegrown upandhving
away from her, theother two only little boys. They
had theircamps near agoolahgool, whence they obtained
water. Agoolahgool isawater-holding tree, oftheiron
bark orboxspecies. Itisatreewith asplit inthefork
of it,andhollow below the fork. After heavy rain, this
hollow trunk would befullofwater, which water would
haveruninto itthrough the split inthefork.Agoolah-
goolwould holdwater foralong time. The blacks knew
agoolahgool, amongst other trees, bythemark which the
overflow ofwater made down thetrunk ofthe tree,
discolouring thebark.
One day,Googarh, theiguana, and histwowives went
outhunting, leaving thetwo little Cookooburrahs atthe
camp. They hadtaken outwater forthemselves intheir
opossum skinwater bags, buttheyhad leftnone forthe
children, whowere toosmall togetanyfrom thegoolah-

tongues were swollen intheir mouths, andtheywere quite
speechless, when theysawamancoming towards them.
When hecame near, theysaw itwasCookooburrah,- their
bigbrother. They could notspeak tohimandanswer,
when heasked where hismother was. Then heasked
them what was thematter. Allthey could dowas to
point towards the tree.Helooked at it,andsaw itwas
agoolahgool, sohesaid :"Didyour mother leave youno
water?"They shook their heads. He said :"Then
you areperishing forwant ofadrink,mybrothers ?"
They nodded. "Go," hesaid, "alittleway off,and
you shall seehow Iwillpunish them forleaving my
little brothers toperish ofthirst." Hewent towards the
tree, climbed up it,and split itrightdown. Ashedidso,
outgushed thewater inaswiftly running stream. Soon
the little fellows quenched their thirst and then, intheir
joy,bathed inthewater, which grew involume every
moment.
Inthemeantime, thosewhohadgone forth tohunt
were returning, and astheycame towards their camp
theymetarunning stream ofwater. "What isthis ?"
they said,"our goolahgool must have burst," andthey
tried todam thewater, but itwasrunning toostrongly
forthem. They gaveuptheeffort andhurried ontowards
their camp. Buttheyfound adeep stream divided them
from their camp. Thethree Cookooburrahs sawthem, and
theeldest onesaid tothe little fellows :"You calloutand
tellthem tocross down there, where itisnotdeep."
The. little ones called outastheywere told,andwhere
they pointed Googarh andhiswives waded intothestream.

Finding shewas getting outofherdepth, Cookooburrah
thelaughing jackass cried out :"Goug gour gah gah.

TheMayamah
The blacks had alllefttheircamp andgoneaway toattend
aborah. Nothing was leftinthecamp butonevery old
dog, toooldtotravel. After theblacks hadbeen gone
about three days, onenight came their enemies, theGoo-
eeays, intending tosuprise them and killthem.
Painted inalltheglory oftheir war-paint came the
Gooeeays, their hair tied intop-knots andornamented with
feathers andkangaroos' teeth. Their waywahs ofpaddy,
melon, andkangaroo ratskins cutinstrips, round their
waists, werenewand strong, holding firmly some oftheir
boomerangs andwoggoorahs, which theyhadstuck through
them.
Butprepared astheywere forconquest, theyfound only
adeserted camp containing naught butoneolddog. They
asked theolddogwhere theblacks were gone. Buthe
onlyshook hishead. Again andagain they asked him,
andagain andagain heonly shook hishead. Atlast
some oftheblack fellows raised their spears and their
moorillahs ornullah-nullahs, saying :
"Ifyoudonot telluswhere theblacks aregone,we
shall killyou."


TheMayamah 51
Then spoke theolddog, saying only :"Gone tothe
borah."
And ashespoke every oneoftheGooeeays andevery-
thing theyhadwiththemwasturned tostone. Even the
waywahs round their waists, thetop-knots ontheir heads,
andthespears intheir hands, even these turned tostone.
Andwhen theblacks returned totheircamp long after-
wards, when theborah was over,andtheboys,whohad
beenmade young men,gone .out intothebush toundergo
their novitiate, each with hissolitary guardian, thensaw
theblacks, their enemies, theGooeeays, standing round
their oldcamp, asiftoattack it.But instead ofbeing
men offlesh, theyweremen ofstone—they, theirweapons,
theirwaywahs, and allthatbelonged tothem, stone.
And atthat place aretobefound stones ormayamahs
ofgreat beauty, striped andmarked andcoloured aswere
themen painted.
And theplace ofthemayamah isononeofthemounts

First heonly crawled about, butsoon hegrew stronger,
andraised himself, andstood byatree. Then daybyday
hegrew stronger andwalked alone, andstronger stillhe

But inthe farcountry atlength onedayBunbundoo-

Andaway went themother asfastasshecould travel

crawling, then standing, then walking, andthen running.
Bigger andbigger were thetracks shefollowed, until she
sawtheywere thetracks ofaman. She followed them
until shereached acamp. Noonewas inthecamp, buta

Oongnairwah andGuinarey
OoNGNAiRWAH, the divcr, andGuinarey, theeagle hawk,
told allthe pelicans, black swans, cranes, andmany
others, thattheywould take their nettothecreek and
catch fish, ifsome ofthem would goandbeat thefish
down towards thenet.
Gladly went thepelicans, black swans, andtherest to
thecreek. Intheyjumped, andsplashed thewater about
toscare the fishdown towards where Oongnairwah and
Guinarey were stationed with their net. Presently little
Deereeree, thewagtail, and Burreenjin, thepeewee, who
wereonthebank sitting onastump, called out,"Look
out,wesawtheback ofanalligator inthewater." The
diver andeaglehawk called back, "Goaway, then. The
wind blows fromyoutowards him. Goback orhewill
smell you."
ButDeereeree andBurreenjin were watching thefishing
and didnotheed what was said tothem. Soon the
alligator smelt them, andhelashed outwith his tail,
splashing thewater sohigh, andlashing sofuriously, that
allthefishermen were drowned, even Deereeree and

Narahdarn theBat
Narahdarn, thebat,wanted honey. Hewatched untilhe
sawaWurranunnah, or,beealight. Hecaught it,stuck a
white feather between itshind legs, let itgoandfollowed
it.Heknew hecould seethewhite feather, andsofollow
thebee toitsnest. Heordered histwowives, ofthe
Bilber tribe, tofollow himwith wirrees tocarryhome the
honey in.Night came onandWurranunnah thebeehad
notreached home. Narahdarn caught him,imprisoned him
under bark, andkepthim safely there until next morning.
When itwas lightenough tosee,Narahdarn letthebeego
again, andfollowed him tohisnest, inagunnyanny tree.
Marking thetreewith hiscomebo thathemight know it
again, hereturned tohurry onhiswives whoweresome
waybehind. Hewanted them tocome on,climb thetree,
andchop outthehoney. When theyreached themarked
treeoneofthewomen climbed up.She called out to
Narahdarn thatthehoney was inasplit inthe tree. He
called back tohertoputherhand inandget itout. She
putherarm in,butfound shecould notget itoutagain.
-Narahdarn climbed uptohelp her,butfound when he
reached herthattheonlyway tofreeherwas tocutoffher

arm. This hedidbefore shehadtime torealise what he
wasgoing todo,and protest. Sogreatwastheshock to
herthatshedied instantly. Narahdarn carried down her
lifeless body andcommanded her sister, hisother wife, to
goup,chop out thearm, and getthe honey. She
protested, declaring thebeeswould have taken thehoney
away bynow.
"Not so,"hesaid; "goatonce."
Every excuse shecould think of,tosave herself, she
made. Butherexcuses were invain, andNarahdarn only
became furious withherformaking them, and, brandishing
hisboondi, drove herupthe tree. Shemanaged toget
herarm inbeside her sister's, butthere itstuck andshe
could notmove it.Narahdarn, whowaswatching her,saw
whathadhappened andfollowed herupthetree. Finding
hecould not pullherarm out, inspite ofher cries, he
chopped itoff,ashehaddone her sister's. After one
shriek, ashedrove hiscomebo through herarm, shewas
silent. He said, "Come down, and Iwillchop outthe
bees' nest." Butshedidnotanswer him,andhesawthat
shetoowas dead. Then hewas frightened, andclimbed
quickly down thegunnyanny tree ;taking herbody tothe
ground with him, helaid itbeside her sister's, and
quickly hehurried from thespot, taking nofurther thought
ofthehoney. Asheneared hiscamp, two little sisters of
hiswives ranouttomeet him, thinking their sisters would
bewithhim,andthattheywould givethem ataste ofthe
honey theyknew theyhadgone outtoget. But totheir
surprise Narahdarn came alone, and ashedrew near to
them theysawhisarms were covered with blood. And
hisfacehadafierce lookon it,which frightened them from


Narahdarn theBat59
even asking where their sisters were. They ranand told
theirmother thatNarahdarn hadreturned alone, thathe
looked fierce andangry, also hisarmswere covered with
blood. Outwent themother oftheBilbers, andshesaid,
"Where aremydaughters, Narahdarn ?Forth went they
thismorning tobringhome thehoney youfound. Youcome
back alone. Youbring nohoney. Your look isfierce, as
ofonewho fights, andyourarms arecovered with blood.
Tellme, Isay,where aremydaughters ?"
"Ask menot, Bilber. AskWurranunnah thebee,he
mayknow. Narahdarn thebatknows nothing." Andhe
wrapt himself inasilence which noquestioning could
pierce. Leaving him there, before hiscamp, themother of
theBilbers returned toherdardurr and toldhertribe that
herdaughters were gone, andNarahdarn, their husband,
would tellhernothing ofthem. Butshe feltsure he
knew their fatr,and certain shewas thathehadsome
taletotell, forhisarms were covered with blood.
The chief ofhertribe listened -toher.When shehad
finished andbegun towail forherdaughters, whom she
thought shewould seenomore, hesaid, "Mother ofthe
Bilbers, your daughters shall beavenged ifaught has
happened tothem atthehands ofNarahdarn. Fresh are
histracks, andtheyoung men ofyour tribe shall follow
whence theyhave come, andfinding what Narahdarn has
done, swiftly shall they return. Then shallwehold a
corrobboree, and ifyour daughters fell athishand
Narahdarn shall bepunished."
The mother ofthe Bilbers said :"Well have you
spoken, ohmyrelation. Nowspeed yetheyoung men lest
the rain fallorthedustblow and thetracks belost."


6o Australian Tales
Then forthwent thefleetest footed andthekeenest eyed of
theyoung menofthetribe. Ere long, back theycame to
thecamp with thenews ofthefateoftheBilbers.
That nightwas thecorrobboree held. Thewomen sat
round inahalf-circle, andchanted amonotonous chant,
keeping timebyhitting, some ofthem, twoboomerangs
together, andothers beating their rolled upopossum rugs.
Big fireswere litontheedge ofthescrub, throwing
lightonthedancers astheycame dancing outfrom their
camps, painted inallmanner ofdesigns, waywahs round
their waists, tufts offeathers intheir hair,andcarrying in
theirhands painted wands. Heading theprocession asthe
men filed outfrom thescrub intoacleared space infront
ofthewomen, came Narahdarn. The light ofthe fires lit
upthetree tops, thedark balahs showed out infantastic
shapes, andweird indeed wasthescene asslowly themen
danced round;louder clicked theboomerangs andlouder
grew thechanting ofthewomen ;higher were the fires
piled, until theflames shot their coloured tongues round the

trunks ofthetrees andhigh into the air.One firewas
bigger than all,andtowards itthedancers edged Narahdarn;
then thevoice ofthemother oftheBilbers shrieked inthe
chanting, highabove thatoftheotherwomen. AsNarah-
darn turned from the firetodance back hefound awall of

him into themadly-leaping fire before him,where he
perished intheflames. And sowere theBilbers avenged.


Mullyangah theMorning Star
MuLLYAN, theeagle hawk, built himself ahome high ina
yaraan tree. There helived apart from his tribe, with
Moodai theopossum, hiswife, andMoodai theopossum,
hismother-in-law. With them toowas Buttergah, a
daughter oftheBuggoo orflying squirrel tribe. Buttergah
wasafriend ofMoodai, thewife ofMullyan, andadistant
cousin totheMoodai tribe.
Mullyan the eagle hawk was acannibal. That was
thereason ofhisliving apart from theother blacks. In
order tosatisfy hiscannibal cravings, heused tosally forth
with abigspear, aspear about four times asbigasan
ordinary spear. Ifhefound ablack fellow hunting alone,
hewould killhimandtake hisbody uptothehouse inthe
tree. There theMoodai andButtergah would cook it,and
allofthem would eattheflesh;forthewomen aswellas
Mullyan were cannibals. This went onforsome time,
until atlastsomany black fellows were slain that their
friends determined tofind outwhat became ofthem, and
they tracked the lastonethey missed. They tracked him
towhere hehadevidently been slain ;they tookupthe
tracks ofhisslayer, andfollowed them right tothefootof


Mullyangah theMorning Star 63
theyaraan tree, inwhich was built thehome ofMullyan.
They tried toclimb thetree, but itwashighand straight,
andtheygaveuptheattempt aftermany efforts. Intheir
despair attlieir failure theythought oftheBibbees, atribe
noted foritsclimbing powers. Theysummoned twoyoung
Bibbees totheir aid.One came, bringing withhim his
friend Murrawondah ofthecHmbing rattribe.
Having heard what theblacks wanted them todo,these
famous climbers went totheyaraan treeandmade astart
atonce. There wasonly lightenough that first night for
them toseetoreach afork inthetreeabout half-way up.
There theycamped, watched Mullyan away inthemorning,
andthen climbed on.Atlasttheyreached thehome of
Mullyan. They watched their chance andthen sneaked
intohishumpy.
When theywere safely inside, theyhastened tosecrete a
smouldering stick inoneendofthehumpy, taking carethey
were notseen .byanyofthewomen. Then theywent
quietly down again, noonethewiser oftheir coming or
going. During theday thewomen heard sometimes a
crackling noise, asofburning, butlooking round theysaw
nothing, andastheirown firewas safe,theytooknonotice,
thinking itmight have been caused bysome grass having
fallen into their fire.
After their descent from having hidden thesmouldering
fire stick, Bibbee andMurrawondah found theblacks and
toldthemwhat theyhaddone. Hearing thattheplanwas
toburn outMullyan, andfearing that thetreemight fall,
they allmoved tosome little distance, there towatch and
wait fortheend. Great was their joyatthethought that
atlast theirenemy was circumvented. Andproud were


64 Australian Tales
Bibbee andMurrawondah astheblack fellows praised their
prowess.
After dinner-time Mullyan came back. When hereached
theentrance tohishouse heputdown hisbigspear out-
side. Then hewent inandthrew himself down torest,
forlonghadhewalked, and littlehadhegained. Inafew
minutes heheard hisbigspear falldown. Hejumped up
andstuck itinitsplace again. Hehadnosooner thrown
himself down, than again heheard itfall. Once more he
roseandreplaced it.Ashereached hisresting-place again,
outburst aflame offirefrom theendofhishumpy. He
called outtothethreewomen, whowere cooking, andthey
rushed tohelphimextinguish theflames. Butinspite of
their efforts the fireonly blazed thebrighter. Mullyan's
armwasburnt off.TheMoodai hadtheir feetburnt, and
Buttergah wasbadly burnt too. Seeing theywere helpless
against the fire,they turned toleave thehumpy toitsfate,
andmake good theirown escape. Buttheyhad left ittoo
late. Astheyturned todescend the tree, theroof ofthe
humpy fellonthem. And allthatremained when the fire
ceased, were thecharred bones ofthedwellers inthe
yaraan tree. Thatwas allthattheblacks found oftheir
enemies ;but their legend says thatMullyan theeagle
hawk lives intheskyasMullyangah themorning star,
ononesideofwhich isalittle star,which ishisonearm;
ontheother alarger star,which isMoodai theopossum,

Goomblegubbon, Beeargah, andOuyan
GooMBLEGUBBON thebustard, histwo wives, Beeargah the
hawk, andOuyan thecurlew, with thetwochildren of
Beeargah, had their camps rightaway inthebush;their
only water supply was asmall dungle, orgilguy hole.
Thewives andchildren camped inonecamp, andGoomble-
gubbon ashort distance offinanother. Onedaythe
wives asked theirhusband tolendthem thedayoorl stone,
thattheymight grind some doonburr tomake durrie. But
hewould notlend ittothem, though they asked him
several times. They knew hedidnotwant touse it
himself, fortheysaw hisdurrie onapiece ofbark,,
between two fires, already cooking. They determined to
berevenged, sosaid :
"We willmakesome water bags oftheopossum skins;
wewill fillthem with water, thensomedaywhen Goomble-
gubbon isouthunting wewillempty thedungle ofwater,
takethechildren, andrunaway !When hereturns hewill
findhiswives andchildren goneandthedungle empty;then
hewillbesorry thathewould notlendusthedayoorl."
The wives soon caught some opossums, killed and
skinned them, plucked allthehairfrom theskins, saving


66 Australian Tales
ittoroll into string tomake goomillahs, cleaned the
skins ofallflesh, sewed them upwith thesinews, leaving
only theneck opening. When finished, they blew into
them, filledthem with air,tiedthem upand leftthem to
dryforafewdays. When theywere dryandready tobe
used, they chose adaywhen Goomblegubbon wasaway,
filled thewater bags, emptied the dungle, and started
towards the river.
Having travelled forsome time, they atlength reached the
river. Theysawtwoblack fellows ontheother side,who,
when theysaw therunaway wives and thetwo children,
swam over tothem andasked whence theyhadcome and
whither theywere going.
"Wearerunning away fromourhusband Goomblegubbon,
whowould lendusnodayoorl togrind ourdoonburr on,and
weranaway lestweandourchildren should starve, forwe
could not liveonmeat alone. Butwhither weare_^oing
weknow not,except that itmust befaraway, lestGoomble-
gubbon follow and killus."
Theblack fellows saidtheywanted wives, andwould each
takeone,andboth care forthechildren. Thewomen agreed.
Theblack fellows swam back across theriver, each taking a
child first, andthen awoman, forastheycame from the
back country, where nocreeks were, thewomen could not
swim.
Goomblegubbon came backfrom hunting, and,seeing no
wives, called aloud forthem, butheard noanswer. Then
hewent totheir camp, butfound them not. Then turning
towards thedungle hesaw that itwasempty. Then hesaw
thetracks ofhiswives andchildren going towards theriver.
Great was hisanger, andvowing hewould killthemwhen


Goomblegubbon andBeeargah 67
hefound them, hepicked uphisspears andfollowed their
tracks, untilhetooreached theriver. There ontheother
sidehesawacamp, and in ithecould seestrange black
fellows, hiswives, andhischildren. Hecalled aloud for
them tocrosshimover, forhetoocould notswim. But
thesunwentdown and stillthey didnotanswer. He
camped where hewas that night, and inthemorning he
sawthecamp opposite hadbeen deserted and set fire to;
thecountry allround wasburnt sothatnoteven thetracks
oftheblack fellows and hiswives could befound, even
hadhebeen able tocross theriver. Andnever again did
heseeorhear ofhiswives orhischildren.


Mooregoo theMopoke, andBahloo
theMoon
Mooregoo theMopoke hadbeencamped away byhimself
foralong time. While alone hehadmade agreatnumber
ofboomerangs, nullah-nullahs, spears, neilahmans, and
opossum rugs. Wellhadhecarved theweapons with the
teeth ofopossums, and brightly hadhepainted theinside
oftherugswith coloured designs, andstrongly hadhesewn
them with thesinews ofopossums, threaded intheneedle
made ofthe littlebone taken from thelegofanemu. As
Mooregoo looked athiswork hewasproud ofallhehad
done.
Onenight Bahloo themoon came tohiscamp, andsaid:
"Lendmeoneofyouropossum rugs."
"No. Ilendnotmyrugs."
"Then givemeone."
"No Igivenotmyrugs."
Looking round, Bahloo saw the beautifully carved
weapons, sohesaid, "Then giveme,Mooregoo, some of
yourweapons."
"No, 1give, never, what Ihave made, toanother."


Mooregoo theMopoke 69
Again Bahloo said, "The night iscold. Lendmea
rug."
"Ihave spoken," said Mooregoo. "Inever lendmy
rugs."
Bahloo saidnomore, butwent away, cutsome bark and
made adardurr forhimself. When itwas finished andhe
safely housed init,down came therain intorrents. And
itrained without ceasing until thewhole country was
flooded. Mooregoo wasdrowned. Hisweapons floated
about anddrifted apart, andhisrugs rotted inthewater.


Ouyan theCurlew
Beeargah thehawk, mother ofOuyan thecurlew, said
oneday toherson:"Go, Ou3'an, out, takeyour spears
and killanemu. Thewomen and Iarehungry. You
areaman, gooutand kill, thatwemay eat.Youmust
notstayalways inthecamp likeanoldwoman;youmust
goandhunt asother men do,lestthewomen laugh at
you."
Ouyan took hisspears andwent outhunting, butthough
hewent far,hecould notgetanemu, yethedare not
return tothecamp andfacethejeers ofthewomen. Well
could they jeer,andangry could hismother growwhen she.
washungry. Sooner than return empty-handed hewould
cutsome flesh offhisown legs. And thishedecided ta
do.Hemade acutinhislegwith hiscomebo andashe
made it,cried aloud :"Yuckay !Yuckay," inpain. But
hecuton,saying :"Sharper would cutthetongues of
thewomen, anddeeper would bethewounds theywould
make ifIreturned without food forthem." Andcrying:
"Yuckay, yuckay, 'ateach stroke ofhiscomebo, heat
length cut offapiece offlesh, and started towards the
camp with it.


Ouyan theCurlew 71
Asheneared thecamp hismother cried out :"What
haveyoubrought usOuyan ?"Westarve formeat, come
quickly."
Hecame and laidtheflesh ather feet,saying :"Far
did Igo,and little did Isee,butthere isenough for all
to-night;to-morrow will Igoforth again."
Thewomen cooked theflesh, andate ithungrily. After-
wards they feltquite ill,butthought itmust bebecause
theyhadeaten toohungrily. The nextdaythey hurried
Ouyan forth again. And again hereturned bringing his
own flesh back. Again thewomen atehungrily of it,and
again they feltquite ill.
Then, too,Beeargah noticed forthe first time thatthe
fleshOuyan brought looked different fromemu flesh. She
asked himwhat flesh itwas. Hereplied :"What should
itbebuttheflesh ofemu ?"
ButBeeargah wasnotsatisfied, andshesaid tothetwo
women who lived with her :"Goyoii,to-morrow, follow
Ouyan, andseewhence hegets this flesh."
Thenext day, thetwowomen followed Ouyan when he
went forth tohunt. They followed atagood distance, that
hemight notnotice thattheywere following. Soon they
heard himcrying asifinpain :"Yuckay, yuckay, yuckay
nurroo gaygay." When theycame neartheysawhewas
cutting theflesh offhisown limbs. Before hediscovered
thattheywere watching him, back they went totheold
woman, and toldherwhat theyhadseen.
SoonOuyan came back, bringing, asusual, theflesh with
him.When hehadthrown itdown athismother's feet,
hewent away, and laydown asiftired from thechase.
Hismother went uptohim,andbefore hehadtime to


72 Australian Tales
cover hismutilated limbs, shesawthatindeed thestory of
thewomen was true. Angry wasshe thathehad so
deceived her;andshe called loudly fortheother two
women, whocame running toher.
"You areright," shesaid. "Too lazy tohunt foremu,
hecut oiifhisown flesh, notcaring thatwhenweunwit-
tingly atethereof weshould sicken. Letusbeathimwho
didusthiswrong."
The threewomen seized poorOuyan and beat him^
though hecried aloud inagony when theblows fellonhis
bleeding legs.
When thewomen had satisfied their vengeance, Beeargah
said :"YouOuyan shallhavenomore fleshonyour legs,
andredshall theybeforever;red,andlongandfleshless."
Saying which shewent, andwith hertheother women.
Ouyan crawled away andhidhimself, andnever again did
hismother seehim. Butnight after nightwas tobeheard
awailing cry of,"Bouyougwai gwai. Bouyougwai
gwai," which meant, "Mypoor red legs.Mypoor red
legs."
Butthough Ouyan themanwasnever seen again, abird
"with long thin legs, very redincolour under thefeathers,
wasseen often, andheard tocryever atnight, even as
Ouyan themanhad cried :"Bouyougwai gwai. Bou
yougwai gwai.'' And thisbirdbears always thename of
Ouyan.


Dinewan theEmu, andWahn
theCrows
Dinewan and histwowives, theWahn, were camping
out. Seeing some clouds gathering, theymade abark
humpy. Itcame ontorain, andthey alltook shelter
under it.Dinewan, when hiswives were notlooking,
gave akick against apiece ofbark atone side ofthe
humpy, knocked itdown, then told hiswives togoand
put itupagain. While they were outside putting itup,
hegave akick,andknocked down apiece ontheother
side;sonosooner were they inagain than outtheyhadto

pected him,anddecided thatoneofthem would watch.
Theonewhowaswatching sawDinewan laugh tohimself
andgoandknock down thebarktheyhadjustputup,chuck-
ling atthethought ofhiswives having togoout inthe

went straight uptoDinewan, whowaslyingdown laughing.


74 Australian Tales
"Now," they said,"you shall feelashotaswedidcold."
Andtheythrew thecoals over him. Dinewan jumped up,
crying aloud with thepain, forhewasbadly burnt. He
rolled himself over,andran into therain;andhiswives
stayed inside, andlaughed aloud athim.


Goolahwilleel theTopknot Pigeons
Young Goolahwilleel used togoouthunting every day.
Hismother and sisters always expected thathewould
bringhome kangaroo andemu forthem. Buteach day
hecamehome without anymeat atall.They asked him
what hedidinthebush, asheevidently didnothunt. He
said thathedidhunt.
"Then why," said they,"doyoU bring usnothing
home ?"
"Icannot catch and killwhat Ifollow," hesaid. "You
hearmecryoutwhen Ifindkangaroo oremu ;isitnot
so?"
"Yes ;eachdaywehearyou callwhen you findsome-
thing, andeach daywegetready the fire, expecting you
tobring home the spoils ofthe chase, butyou bring
nothing."
"To-morrow," hesaid,"you shall notbedisappointed.
Iwillbring you akangaroo."
Every day, instead ofhunting, Goolahwilleel hadbeen
gathering wattle-gum, andwith thishehadbeen modelling
akangaroo—aperfect model ofone, tail, ears, and all
complete. Sothenext dayhecame towards thecamp


76 Australian Tales
carrying thiskangaroo made ofgum. Seeing himcoming,
andalsoseeing thathewascarrying thepromised kangaroo,
hismother and sisters said: "Ah, Goolahwilleel, spoke
truly. Hehaskept hisword, andnow brings usa
kangaroo. Pileupthe fire. To-night weshall eatmeat."
About ahundred yards away from thecamp Goolahwilleel
putdown hismodel, andcame onwithout it.Hismother
called out :"Where isthekangaroo youbrought home ?"
"Oh,over there." And hepointed towards where he
had left it.
The sisters rantoget it,butcame back saying: "Where
isit?Wecannot see it."
"Over there," hesaid, pointing again.
"Butthere isonly agreat figure ofgum there."
"Well, did Isay itwasanything else?Did Inotsay
itwasgum."
"No,youdidnot.You said itwasakangaroo."
"And soitisakangaroo. Abeautiful kangaroo that I
made allbymyself." Andhesmiled quite proudly tothink
what afinekangaroo hehadmade.
But hismother and sisters didnotsmile. They seized
him,andgave himagood beating fordeceiving them.
They toldhimheshould never gooutalone again, forhe
only played instead ofhunting, though heknew they
starved formeat. They would always inthefuture go
with him.
And soforever theGoolahwilleels went inflocks, never
more singly, insearch offood.

daythetwowives haddone something toanger Goonur,
their husband, andhegave them both agreat beating.
After their beating theywentaway bythemselves. They
said toeach other thatthey could stand their present life
nolonger, andyettherewasnoescape unless they killed
their husband. They decided theywould dothat. But
how ?Thatwasthequestion. Itmust bebycunning.
Atlastthey decided onaplan. They dugabighole
inthesand near thecreek, filled itwith water, andcovered
theholeoverwithboughs, leaves, andgrass.
"Now wewill go,"they said,"and tellourhusband
thatwehavefound abigbandicoot's nest."
Back theywent tothecamp, and toldGoonur that they

forhewasdrowning andcould notescape. Hiswives
hadwatched thesuccess oftheir stratagem from adistance.
When theywere certain thattheyhad effectually disposed
oftheir hated husband, theywent back tothecamp.
Goonur, themother, soon missed herson,made inquiries
ofhiswives, butgained noinformation from them. Two
orthree days passed, andyetGoonur, theson, returned

given hernotice ofhisintention, themother determined to
follow histrack. Shetookuphistrailwhere shehad last
seenhim leave thecamp. This shefollowed until she
reached theso-called bandicoot's nest. Here histracks
disappeared, andnowhere could she find asign ofhis

Assoon ashewasable todoso,hetoldherofthetrick
hiswives hadplayed onhim.
Goonur, themother, was furious. "Nomore shall they

haveyouashusband. You shall livehidden inmydardurr.
When wegetnear thecamp youcangetinto this long,
bigcomebee, and Iwilltakeyou in.When youwant to
gohunting Iwilltakeyoufrom thecamp inthiscomebee,
andwhenweareoutofsightyoucangetoutandhunt as
ofold."
Andthustheymanaged forsome time tokeep hisreturn
asecret ;and httle thewives knew that their husband was
alive and inhismother's camp. But asday after day
Goonur, themother, returned from hunting loaded with
spoils, theybegan tothink shemust have helpfromsome
one ;forsurely, they said, nooldwoman could beso
successful inhunting. There wasamystery theywere
sure, andtheywere determined tofind itout.
"See," they said, "shegoes outalone. She isold,and
yetshebrings hpmemore thanwetwodotogether, andwe
areyoung. To-day shebrought opossums, piggiebillahs,
honey yams, quatha, andmany things. Wegot little, yet
wewent far.We willwatch her."
The next time oldGoonur went out,carrying herbig
comebee, thewives watched her.
"Look," they said,"how slowly shegoes. She,could
notchmb trees foropossums—she istoooldandweak;
lookhowshestaggers."
They went cautiously after her,andsawwhen shewas
some distance from thecamp thatsheputdown hercome-
bee.And outof it,totheir amazement, stepped Goonur,
their husband.
"Ah," they said, "this isher secret. Shemust have
found him, and, asshe isagreat doctor, shewas able to
bring him tolifeagain.Wemust wait until sheleaves


8o Australian Tales
him,andthengotohim,andbeg toknow where hehas
been, andpretend joythatheisback, orelse surely now
heisalive again hewillsometime killus."
Accordingly, when Goonur wasalone thetwowives ran
tohim,andsaid :
"Why, Goonur, ourhusband, didyouleave us?Whfere
have youbeen allthetime that we,your wives, have
mourned foryou?Long hasthetime been without you,
andwe,your wives, havebeen sadthatyoucame nomore
toourdardurr.''
Goonur, thehusband, affected tobelieve their sorrow
was genuine, and that they didnotknow when they
directed him tothebandicoot's nest that itwas atrap.
Which trap, but forhismother, might have been his
grave.
They allwent hunting together, andwhen they had
killed enough forfood they returned tothecamp. As
they came near tothecamp, Goonur, themother, saw
them coming, andcried out:
"Would youagain betricked byyour wives ?Did I
saveyoufrom death only thatyoumight again bekilled ?
Ispared them, but Iwould Ihad slain them, ifagain they
aretohave achance ofkilling you,myson.Many arethe

with you. They tried tolureyou todeath;youareno
longer theirs, mine onlynow, fordid Inotbring youback
from thedead ?
ButGoonur thehusband said, "Intruth didyou save
me,mymother, andthesemywives rejoice thatyou did.
They too,as Iwas, were deceived bythe bandicoot's

nest, thework ofanenemy yet tobefound. See,my
mother, donotthelooks oflove intheir eyes, andwords
ofloveontheir lipsvouch fortheir truth ?We willbeas
wehave been,mymother, and liveagain inpeace."
Andthus craftily didGoonur thehusband deceive his
wives andmake them believe hetrusted them wholly,
while inreality hismindwaseven then plotting vengeance.
Inafewdays hehad hisplans ready. Having cutand
pointed sharply two stakes, hestuck them firmly inthe
creek, thenheplaced twologsonthebank, infront ofthe
sticks, which were underneath thewater, and invisible.
Having made hispreparations, heinvited hiswives to
come forabathe. Hesaidwhen theyreached thecreek :
"Seethose two logs onthebank, youjump ineach
fromoneandseewhich candive thefurthest. Iwillgo
first toseeyou asj'oucome up."And inhejumped,
carefully avoiding thepointed stakes. "Right," hecalled,
"All isclear here,jump in."
Then thetwowives randown thebank each toalogand
jumped from it.WellhadGoonur calculated thedistance, for
bothjumped rightontothestakes placed inthewater to
catch them, andwhich stuck firmly intothem, holding them
under thewater.
"Wellam Iavenged," saidGoonur. "Nomore will
mywives laytraps tocatch me." And hewalked off
tothecamp.
Hismother asked himwhere hiswives were. "They
leftme,"hesaid, "togetbees' nests."
Butasdaybydaypassed andthewives returned not,
theoldwoman began tosuspect thathersonknewmore than

opportunity, when hersonwasaway hunting, and then
followed thetracks ofthewives. Shetracked them tothe
creek, andasshesawnotracks oftheir return, shewent
intothecreek, feltabout, and there found thetwobodies
fastonthestakes. Shemanaged togetthem offandout
ofthecreek, then shedetermined totryand restore them
tolife, forshewasangry that hersonhadnot told her
what hehaddone, buthaddeceived heraswell ashis
wives. Sherubbed thewomen withsome ofhermedicines,
dressed thewounds made bythestakes, andthen dragged
them bothontoants' nests andwatched their bodies as
theants crawled over them, biting them. Shehad not
long towait ;soon they began tomove andcome tolife
again.
Assoon astheywere restored Goonur tookthem back
tothecamp and said toGoonur her son, "Now once
did Iusemyknowledge torestore life toyou, andagain
have Iused ittorestore lifetoyour wives. You are all
mine now,and Idesire thatyou live inpeace andnever
more deceive me,ornever again shall Iusemyskill for
you."
Andthey lived foralongwhile together, andwhen the
Mother Doctor died therewasabeautiful, dazzlingly bright
falling star, followed byasound asofasharp clap of
thunder, and allthe tribes round when theysaw and
heard this said, "Agreat doctor musthave died, forthat is
thesign." Andwhen thewives died, theywere taken up
tothesky,where they arenowknown asGwaibillah, the
red star, socalled from itsbright redcolour, owing, the
legend says, totheredmarks leftbythestakes onthe
bodies ofthetwowomen, andwhich nothing could efface.


Deereeree theWagtail, andthe
Rainbow
Deereeree was awidow and lived inacamp alone with
herfour little girls. OnedayBibbee came andmade a
camp notfarfrom hers. Deereeree wasfrightened ofhim,
toofrightened togotosleep. Allnight sheused towatch
hiscamp, and ifsheheard asound shewould cryaloud :
"Deereeree, wyah, wyah, Deereeree." Sometimes she
would becalling outnearly allnight.
Inthemorning, Bibbee would come over tohercamp
andaskherwhatwasthematter thatshehadcalled out
sointhenight. She toldhim thatshethought sheheard
some onewalking about andwas afraid, forshewas alone
withherfour little girls.
Hetoldhersheought not tobeafraid with allher
children round her. But night after night she satup
crying: "Wyah, wyah, Deereeree, Deereeree."
AtlastBibbee said :"Ifyou aresofrightened, marry
meand live inmycamp. Iwilltake careofyou." But
Deereeree saidshedidnotwant tomarry. Sonight after
nightwas tobeheard herplaintive cryof"Wyah, wyah.

Deereeree, Deereeree." Andagain andagain Bibbee pressed
her toshare hiscamp andmarry him. Butshealways
refused. Themore sherefused themore hewished to
marry her.And heused towonder howhecould induce
hertochange hermind.
Atlasthethought ofaplan ofsurprising herintogiving
herconsent. Hesettowork andmade abeautiful and
many coloured arch, which, when itwasmade, hecalled
Euloowirree, andheplaced itright across thesky,reaching
fromonesideoftheearth totheother. When ther.ainbow
was firmly placed intheskyandshowing outinallits
brilliancy ofmany colours, asaroadway from theearth tothe
stars, Bibbee went into hiscamp towait. When Deereeree
looked upattheskyandsawthewonderful rainbow, she
thought something dreadful must begoing tohappen. She
was terribly frightened, andcalled aloud :"Wyah, wyah."
Inher fear shegathered herchildren together, and fled
withthem toBibbee's camp forprotection.
Bibbee proudly toldherthathehadmade therainbow,
just toshowhowstrong hewasandhow safeshewould be
ifshemarried him. But ifshewould not,shewould see
what terrible things hewould make tocome ontheearth,
notjustaharmless andbeautiful roadway across theheavens,
butthings thatwould burst from theearth anddestroy it.
Sobyworking onhermixed feelings offear ofhis
prowess, andadmiration ofhis skill, Bibbee gained his
desire andDeereeree married him. Andwhen long after-
wards they died, Deereeree waschanged into the little
willy wagtail whomay beheard through the stillness
ofthesummer nights, crying her plaintive wail of
"Deereeree, wyah, wyah, Deereeree."

Mooregoo theMopoke, andMoonin-
guggahgul theMosquito Bird
Anoldman lived with histwowives, theMooninguggahgul
sisters, andhistwosons. The oldman spent allhistime
making boomerangs, until atlasthehad four nets fullof
these weapons. Thetwoboys used togoouthunting
opossums andiguanas, which theywould cook inthebush,
and eat,without thinking ofbringing anyhome totheir
parents. The oldman asked them oneday tobring him
home some fattorubhisboomerangs with. This theboys
did,buttheybrought only the fat,having eaten therestof
theiguanas fromwhich theyhad taken the fat.The old
manwasveryangry that hissonswere sogreedy, buthe
saidnothing, though hedetermined topunish them, forhe
thought "when theywere young, and could nothunt, I
hunted forthem andfedthem well ;now thattheycanhunt
and Iamoldandcannot sowell, they givemenothing."
Thinking ofhistreatment atthehands ofhissons, he
greased allhisboomerangs, andwhen hehad finished
them hesaid totheboys :"You take these boome-
rangs down ontotheplain and trythem;see ifIhave


Mooregoo theMopoke 87
made them well. Then come back and tellme. Iwill
stay here.''
Theboys took theboomerangs. They threw them one
after another ;but totheir surprise notone ofthe
boomerangs theythrew touched theground, but, instead,
went whirling upoutofsight. When theyhad finished
throwing theboomerangs, allofwhich acted inthesame
way, whirling upthrough space, they prepared tostart
home again. Butasthey looked round theysawahuge
whirlwind coming towards them. They were frightened
and called outI'Wurrawilberoo," fortheyknew therewas
adevil inthewhirlwind. They laidhold oftrees near at
hand that itmight notcatch them. But thewhirlwind
spread out first onearmandrooted upone tree,then
another arm,androoted upanother. Theboys raninfear
from tree totree, buteach tree thattheywent towastorn
upbythewhirlwind. Atlastthey rantotwomubboo or
beef-wood trees, andclung tightly tothem. After them
rushed thewhirlwind, sweeping allbefore it,andwhen it
reached themubboo trees, towhich theboyswere clinging,
ittorethem from their roots andborethemupward swiftly,
giving theboys notime toleave go,sotheywere borne
upward clinging tothemubboo trees. Onthewhirlwind
borethem until theyreached thesky,where itplaced the
twotrees with theboys still clinging tothem. And there
they still are,near theMilkyWay, andknown asWurra-
wilberoo. Theboomerangs are scattered allalong the
Milky Way, forthewhirlwind had gathered them all
together initsrush through space. Having placed them
allinthesky,down came thewhirlwind, retaking its
natural shape, which was that oftheoldman, forsohad


88 Australian Tales
hewreaked hisvengeance onhissons forneglecting their
parents.
Astimewent on,themothers wondered why their sons
didnotreturn. Itstruck them asstrange thattheoldman
expressed nosurprise attheabsence oftheboys, andthey
suspected thatheknew more than hecared tosay. For
heonly satinthecamp smiling while hiswives discussed
what could havehappened tothem, andheletthewomen
gooutandsearch alone. Themothers tracked their sons
tothe plain. There theysawthat abigwhirlwind had
lately been, fortrees were uprooted andstrewn inevery
direction. They tracked their sons from tree totree until
atlasttheycame totheplace where themubboos had
stood. Theysawthetracks oftheir sons beside theplaces
whence thetrees hadbeen uprooted, butofthetrees and
their sons theysawnofurther trace. Then theyknew
thattheyhad allbeen borne uptogether bythewhirlwind,
andtaken whither theyknew not. Sadly they returned to
their camp. When night came theyheard crieswhich they
recognised asmade bythevoices oftheir sons, though they
sounded asifcoming from thesky. Asthecriessounded
again themothers looked upwhence theycame, andthere
theysawthemubboo trees with their sons beside them.
Then well theyknew that theywould seenomore their
sons onearth, and greatwas their grief, andwroth were
theywith theirhusband, forwelltheyknewnow thathemust
have been thedevil inthewhirlwind, whohadsopunished
theboys. Theyvowed toavenge thelossoftheir boys.
The next daytheywent outandgathered alotof
pinegum,andbrought itback tothecamp. When they
reached thecamp theoldman called tooneofhiswives to


Mooregoo theMopoke 89
come andtease hishair, ashishead ached, andthatalone
would reheve thepain. One ofthewomen went over to
him, took hisheadonher lap,andteased hishair until at
lasttheoldmanwassoothed andsleepy. Inthemeantime
theother wifewas melting thegum. The onewith the
oldmangaveherasecret sign tocome near ;thensheasked
theoldman tolieonhisback, thatshemight tease his
front hair better. Ashedidso,shesigned totheother
woman, who quickly came, gave hersome ofthemelted
gum, which theyboth then poured hotinto hiseyes, filling
them with it.Inagony theoldmanjumped upandran
about, calling out, "Mooregoo, mooregoo," asheran. Out
ofthecamp heranand faraway, still crying outinhis
agony, ashewent. Andnever again didhiswives seehim
though every night they heard hiscryof"Mooregoo,
mooregoo." Butthough they never saw their husband,
theysawanight hawk, theMopoke, and asthat cried
always, "Mooregoo, mooregoo," astheirhusband hadcried
inhisagony, theyknew thathemust have turned into
thebird.
After atime thewomen were changed intoMooningug-
gahgul, ormosquito birds. These birds aremarked onthe
wings just like amosquito, andeverysummer night you
canhearthem cryout incessantly, "Mooninguggahgul,"
which cry isthe call forthemosquitoes toanswer by
coming outandbuzzing inchorus. And asquickly the
mosquitoes come out inanswer tothesummons, the
Mooninguggahgul bidthem flyeverywhere and bite allthey
can.


Bougoodoogahdah theRain Bird
BouGooDOOGAHDAH was anoldwoman who lived alone
withherfourhundred dingoes. From living solongwith
these dogs shehadgrown nottocare forherfellow crea-
tures except asfood. Sheandthedogs lived onhuman
flesh, and itwashercunning which gained such food for
them all.Shewould sally forth from hercamp with her
two little dogs ;shewould besure tomeet some black
fellows, probably twenty orthirty, goingdown tothecreek.
Shewould say, "Ican tellyouwhere there are lotsof
paddy melons." They would askwhere, andshewould
answer, "Over there, onthepoint ofthat moorillah or
ridge. Ifyou will gothere andhave your nullahs
ready, Iwillgowithmytwodogs andround themup
towards you."
Theblack fellowsi invariably stationed themselves where she
hadtoldthem, and offwentBougoodoogahdah andhertwo
dogs. Butnottoround upthepaddy melons. Shewent
quickly towards hercamp, calling softly, "Birree gougou,"
which meant "Sool 'em, sool 'em,"andwas thesignal for
thedogs tocome out. Quickly theycame andsurrounded
theblack fellows, tookthem bysurprise, flew atthem, bit


Bougoodoogahdah theRain Bird 91
andworried them todeath. Then theyandBougoodoo-
gahdah dragged thebodies totheir camp. There they
were cooked andwere food fortheoldwoman andthedogs
forsome time. Assoon asthesupply was finished the
same plan toobtain morewasrepeated.
Theblack fellows missed somany oftheir friends thatthey
determined tofindoutwhathadbecome ofthem. They began
tosuspect theoldwoman who lived alone andhunted over
themoorillahs with hertwo little dogs. They proposed
thatthenext party thatwent tothecreek should divide
andsome staybehind inhiding andwatch whatwent on.
Those watching sawtheoldwoman advance towards their
friends, talk tothem forawhile, andthen gooffwith her
twodogs. They saw their friends station themselves at
thepoint ofthemoorillah orridge, holding their nullahs in
readiness, asifwaiting forsomething tocome. Presently
they heard alowcryfrom the oldwoman of"Birree
goiigou," which crywas quickly followed bydingoes
coming outofthebush inevery direction, inhundreds,
surrounding theblack fellows atthepoint.
Thedingoes closed in,quickly hemming theblack fellows
inallround;thentheymade asimultaneous rush atthem,
torethem with their teeth, and killed them.
Theblack fellows watching, saw thatwhen thedogshad
killed their friends theywere joined bytheoldwoman, who
helped them todrag offthebodies totheir camp.
Having seen allthis,backwent thewatchers totheir tribe
andtoldwhat theyhadseen. Allthetribes round mustered
upanddecided toexecute aswift vengeance. Inorder to
doso,outthey sallied wellarmed. Adetachment wenton
toentrap thedogsandBougoodoogahdah. Then justwhen


92 Australian Tales
theusual massacre oftheblacks was tobegin andthedogs
were closing inround them forthepurpose, outrushed over
twohundred black fellows, andsoeffectual was their attack
thatevery dogwas killed, aswell asBougoodoogahdah and
hertwo little dogs.
The oldwoman laywhere shehadbeen slain, butasthe
blacks wentaway they heard hercry"Bougoodoogahdah."
Soback theywentandbroke herbones, firsttheybroke her
legsandthen lefther. Butagain astheywent they heard
hercry"Bougoodoogahdah." Then back again they came,
andagain, until atlastevery bone inherbodywasbroken,
but still she cried "Bougoodoogahdah." Sooneman
waited beside hertoseewhence came thesound, forsurely,
they thought, shemust bedead. Hesawherheart move
andcryagain "Bougoodoogahdah "and as itcried, out
came alittle birdfrom it.This little bird runs onthe
moorillahs and calls atnight "Bougoodoogahdah." All
day itstays inone place, andonly atnight comes out.
Itisalittle greyish bird, something likeaweedah. The
blacks call itarain-maker, forifanyonesteals itseggs it
cries outincessantly "Bougoodoogahdah"until inanswer
toits callthe rain falls. Andwhen thecountry is
stricken with adrought, the blacks look forone of
these little birds, and finding it,chase it,until itcries
aloud "Bougoodoogahdah, Bougoodoogahdah "andwhen
they hear itscry inthedaytime theyknow therain will
soon fall.
Asthe little birdflewfrom theheart ofthewoman, all
thedead dingoes were changed into snakes, many different
kinds, allpoisonous. Thetwo little dogs were changed
intodayah minyah, avery small kind ofcarpet snake, non-


Bougoodoogahdah theRain Bird 93
poisonous, forthese two littledogs hadnever bitten the
blacks astheother dogshaddone. Atthepoints ofthe
moorillahs where Bougoodoogahdah andherdingoes used
toslay theblacks, areheaps ofwhite stones, which are
supposed tobethefossilised bones ofthemassacred men.


TheBorah ofByamee
Word hadbeen passed from tribe totribe, telling, how
thattheseason wasgood, there must beagreat gathering
ofthe tribes. And theplace fixed forthegathering was
Googoorewon. The oldmenwhispered that itshould be
theoccasion foraborah, but this thewomen must not
know. OldByamee, whowas agreat Wirreenun, saidhe
would take histwo sons, Ghindahindahmoee andBooma-
hoomahnowee, tothegathering ofthe tribes, forthetime
hadcomewhen theyshould bemadeyoung men, thatthey
might befree tomarry wives, eatemu flesh, andlearn tobe
warriors.
Astribe after tribe arrived atGoogoorewon, each took
upaposition atoneofthevarious points oftheridges,
surrounding theclear open space where thecorrobborees
were tobe.TheWahn, crows, hadone point;the
Dummerh, pigeons, another ;theMahthi, dogs, another,
andsoon;Byamee andhistribe,Byahmul theblackswans
tribe, Oooboon, thebluetongued lizard, andmany other
chiefs andtheir tribes, eachhad theircamp onadifferent
point. When allhad arrived there were hundreds and
hundreds assembled, andmany andvaried were thenightly


TheBorah ofByamee95
corrobborees, each tribe trying toexcel theother inthe
fancifulness oftheir painted get-up andthenovelty oftheir
newest songanddance. Bydaytherewasmuch hunting
and feasting, bynightmuch dancing andsinging;pledges
offriendship exchanged, adillibag foraboomerang, andso
on;young daughters given tooldwarriors, oldwomen
given toyoung men,unborn girls promised tooldmen,
babies inarms promised togrown men ;many anddiverse
were thecompacts entered into, andalways were the
Wirreenun, ordoctors ofthetribes consulted.
After some days theWirreenun told themen ofthe
tribes that theywere going tohold aborah. Buton
noaccount must theinnerh, orwomen, know. Daybyday
theymust allgoforth asiftohunt andthen prepare in
secret theborah ground. Outwent themen each day.
They cleared avery large circle quite clear, then they built
anearthen damround this circle, and cleared apathway
leading into thethick bush from thecircle, and built adam
oneither sideofthispathway.
When allthese preparations were finished, they had, as
usual, acorrobboree atnight. After thishadbeen going on
forsome time, oneoftheoldWirreenun walked rightaway
from thecrowd asifhewere sulky. Hewent tohiscamp,
towhere hewasfollowed byanother Wirreenun, andpre-
sently thetwooldfellows began fighting. Suddenly, when
theattention oftheblacks was fixed onthis fight, therecame
astrange, whizzing, whirring noise from thescrub round. The
women andchildren shrank together, forthesudden, uncanny,
noise frightened them. And theyknew that itwasmade
bythespirits whowerecoming toassist attheinitiation of
theboys intoyoung manhood. Thenoise really sounded,


96 Australian Tales
ifyouhadnotthedread ofspirits inyour mind, justasif
some onehad acircular piece ofwood attheendofa
string andwere whirling itround andround.
Asthenoise went on,thewomen said, inanawestricken
tone, "Gurraymy," that is"borah devil," and clutched
their children tighter tothem. Theboys said "Gayandy,"
and their eyes extended with fear. "Gayandy "meant
borah devil too,butthewomen must noteven usethesame
word astheboysandmen toexpress theborah spirit, for
allconcerning themysteries ofborah aresacred from the
ears, eyes, ortongues ofwomen.
Thenextdayashiftwasmade ofthecamps. They
weremoved toinside thebigring that theblack fellows
hadmade. Thismovewasattended with acertain amount
ofceremony. Intheafternoon, before themove hadtaken
place, alltheblack fellows lefttheircamps andwentaway
intothescrub. Then justabout sundown theywere allto
beseenwalking insingle fileoutofthescrub, along the
pathwhich theyhadpreviouly banked oneach side. Every
manhadafirestick inonehand andagreen switch inthe
other. When thesemenreached themiddle oftheenclosed
ringwas thetime fortheyoung people andwomen to
leave theoldcamps, andmove intotheborah ring. Inside
this ring theymade their camps, had their suppers and
corrobbc«-eed, asonprevious evenings, uptoacertain stage.
Before, onthis occasion, that stage arrived, Byamee, who
wasgreatest oftheWirreenun present, hadshown hispower
inaremarkable way. Forsome days theMahthi hadbeen
behaving with agreat want ofrespect forthewisemenof
the tribes. Instead oftreating their sayings anddoings
with the silent awe theWirreenun expect, theyhadkept


TheBorah ofByamee 97
upanincessant chatter andlaughter amongst themselves^
playing andshouting asifthetribes were notcontemplat-
ingthesolemnisation oftheirmost sacred rites. Frequently
theWirreenun sternly bade them besilent. Butadmoni-
tions wei"e useless, gaily chattered andlaughed theMahthi.
Atlength Byamee, mightiest andmost famous ofthe-
Wirreenun, rose, strode over tothecamp ofMahthi, andsaid
fiercely tothem :"I,Byamee, whom allthetribes hold in
honour, have thrice badeyouMahthi cease your chatter
and laughter. Butyouheeded me not.Tomyvoice
were added thevoices oftheWirreenun ofother tribes.
Butyouheeded not. Think youtheWirreenun willmake
anyofyour tribe young menwhen youheed not their
words ?No, Itellyou. From thisdayforth noMahthi
shall speak again asmen speak. Youwish tomake noise,

shall bethenoise ofbarking andthenoise ofhowling.
Andfrom thisday ifever aMahthi speaks, woe tothose
whohear him, foreven astheyhear shall theybeturned
tostone."
And astheMahthi opened their mouths, and tried to
laugh andspeak derisive words, they found, even asByamee
said, sowere they. They could butbark andhowl;the
powers ofspeech andlaughter hadthey lost. And asthey
realised their loss, into their eyescame alookofyearning
anddumb entreaty, which willbeseen intheeyes oftheir
descendants forever.Afeeling ofwonder andawe fell

onthevarious camps astheywatched Byamee march back
tohis tribe.
When Byamee was seated again inhiscamp, he
asked thewomen why theywere notgrinding doonburr.
And thewomen said :"Gone areourdayoorls, andwe
know notwhere."
"You lie," saidByamee. "Youhave lentthem tothe
Dummerh, whocame sooften toborrow, though Ibadeyou
notlend."
"No,Byamee, welentthem not."
"Gotothecamp oftheDummerh, andask foryour

Thewomen, with thefear ofthefateoftheMahthi did
they disobey, went, though well they,knew theyhad not

Asthewomen went onthey heard astrange noise, as
ofthecryofspirits, asound likeasmothered "Oom, oom,

knew that indeed theWondah were about, andhetoo
clutched his firestickandwent back into hiscamp.
Inthemorning itwasseen that notonlywere allthe
dayoorls gone, butthecamp oftheDummerh wasempty and
theytoohadgone.When noonewould lend theDummerh
dayoorls, theyhad said, "Thenwecangrind nodoonburr
unless theWondah bring usstones." And scarcely were
thewords said before theysawadayoorl moving towards
them. Atfirst theythought itwas theirown skillwhich
enabled them only toexpress awish tohave itrealised.
Butasdayoorl after dayoorl glided into their camp, and,
passing through there, moved on,andastheymoved was
thesound of"Oom, oom, oom, oom," tobeheard every-
where theyknew itwastheWondah atwork. And itwas
borne inuponthem thatwhere thedayoorl went theymust
go,ortheywould anger thespirits whohadbrought them
through their camp.
They gathered uptheir belongings andfollowed inthe
track ofthedayoorls, which had cutapathway fromGoo-
goorewon toGirrahween, down which inhigh floods is
nowawater-course. From Girrahween, onthedayoorls
went toDirangibirrah, and after them theDummerh.


loo Australian Tales
Dirangibirrah isbetween Brewarrina andWidda Murtee,
andthere thedayoorls piled themselves upintoamountain,
andthere forthefuture had theblacks togowhen they
wanted good dayoorls. And theDummerh were changed
into pigeons, with acrylike the spirits of"Oom, oom,
oom."
Another strange thing happened atthisbigborah. A
tribe, called Ooboon, werecamped atsome distance from the
other tribes. When anystranger went totheir camp, it
wasnoticed that thechief oftheOoboon would come out
andflash alightonhim,which killed him instantly. And
nooneknew what this light was, that carried death inits
gleam. At last,Wahn thecrow, said"Iwill takemy
biggest booreen andgoand seewhat thismeans. You
others, donotfollow metoo closely, forthough Ihave
planned how tosavemyself from thedeadly gleam, Imight
notbeable tosaveyou."
Wahn walked intothecamp oftheOoboon, andastheir
chief turned toflash thelight onhim,heputuphisbooreen
andcompletely shaded himself from it,andcalled aloud in
adeep voice"Wah, wah, wah, wah," which sostartled
Ooboon thathedropt his light, and said "What isthe
matter ?You startled me. Ididnotknowwhoyouwere
andmight have hurt you, though, Ihadnowish to,forthe
Wahn aremyfriends,"
"Icannot stopnow," said theWahn, "Imust goback
tom3'camp, Ihave forgotten something Iwanted toshow
you. I'llbeback soon." Andsosaying, swiftly ranWahn
back towhere hehad lefthisboondee, then back hecame
almost before Ooboon realised thathehadgone. Back he
came, andstealing upbehind Ooboon dealthimablow with

hisboondee thatavenged amply thevictims ofthedeadly
light, bystretching thechief oftheOoboon acorpse onthe
ground athis feet. Then crying triumphantly, "Wah,
wah,wah," back tohiscamp wentWahn and toldwhat he
haddone.
This night, when theborah corrobboree began, allthe
women relations oftheboys tobemadeyoung men, corrob-
boreed allnight. Towards theendofthenight allthe
young women were ordered intobough humpies, which had
been previously made allround theedge oftheembankment
surrounding thering. The oldwomen stayed on.
Themenwhowere tohave charge oftheboys tobe
made young men,were toldnow tobeready toseize hold
each ofhisspecial charge, tocarryhim offdown thebeaten
track tothescrub. When every man had, atasignal,
taken hischarge onhisshoulder, they allstarted dancing
round thering. Then theoldwomen were told tocome
andsaygood-bye totheboys, after which they were
ordered tojoin theyoung women inthehumpies. About
fivemenwatched them into thehumpies, then pulled the
boughs down onthetopofthem thattheymight seenothing
further.
When thewomen were safely imprisoned beneath the
boughs, themen carrying theboys swiftly disappeared
down thetrack into thescrub. When theywere outof
sight the fiveblack fellows came and pulled theboughs
away and released thewomen, whowentnow totheir
camps. Buthowever curious thesewomen were astowhat
rites attended theboys' initiation intomanhood, theyknew
noquestions would elicitanyinformation. Insome months'
time they might seetheir boys return minus, perhaps, a


I02 Australian Tales
front tooth, andwithsome extra scarifications ontheir
bodies, butbeyond that,andaknowledge ofthefact that
theyhadnotbeen allowed tolook ontheface ofwoman
since their disappearance into thescrub, theywere never
enlightened.
Thenextdaythetribes made ready totravel totheplace
ofthe little borah, which would beheld inabout four days'
time, atabout tenortwelve miles distance from thescene
ofthebigborah.
Attheplace ofthe little borah aring ofgrass ismade
instead ofoneofearth. Thetribes alltravel together there,
camp, andhave acorrobboree. Theyoungwomen aresent
tobed early, andtheoldwomen stay until thetimewhen
theboys bade farewell tothem atthebigborah, atwhich
hour theboys arebrought intothe little borah andallowed
tosayalastgood-bye totheoldwomen. Then they are
taken away bythemenwhohave charge ofthem together.
They stay together forashort time, thenprobably separate,,
eachman with hisoneboygoing inadifferent direction.
Theman keeps strict charge oftheboy for atleast six
months, during which timehemaynoteven look athisown
mother. Attheendofabout sixmonths hemaycome
back tohistribe, buttheeffect ofhisisolation isthatheis
toowild andfrightened tospeak even tohismother, from
whom herunsaway ifsheapproaches him, untilbydegrees
thestrangeness wears off.
But atthisborah ofByamee thetribes were notdestined
tomeet theboys atthe little borah. Just astheywere
gathering uptheirgoods forastart, intothecamp staggered
Millindooloonubbah, thewidow, crying, "You allleftme,

Asshespoke, swiftly went awoman toherwith awirree

amother livewhen herchildren aredead ?"And shelay
back with agroan. But asshe feltthewater coolher
parched lipsand soften herswollen tongue, shemade a
final effort, rose toher feet,andwaving herhands round
thecamps ofthetribes, cried aloud :"You were insuch
haste togethere. You shall stay here. Googoolguyyah.
Googoolguyj'ah. Turn into trees. Turn intotrees." Then
back she fell,dead. And asshe fell,thetribes thatwere
standing round theedge ofthering, preparatory togather-
ingtheirgoods andgoing, andthatherhand pointed toas
itwaved round, turned into trees. There theynow stand.
The tribes inthebackground were changed each according
tothename theywereknown by,into that birdorbeast of
thesame name. The barking Mahthi into dogs;the


I04 Australian Tales
Byahmul into black swans ;theWahns into crows, and
soon.And there attheplace ofthebigborah, youcan
seethetrees standing tallandgaunt, sad-looking intheir
sombre hues, waving with asadwailing their branches
towards the;lakewhich covers now theplace where the
borah was held. And itbears thename ofGoogoorewon,

thenames ofthetribes ofold.TheByahmuls sailproudly
about ;thepelicans, their water rivals inpoint ofsizeand

andoutthrough thegrass. Now andthen isheard the
"Oom, oom, oom," ofthedummerh, andoccasionally acry
from the bird Millindooloonubbah of"Googoolguyyah,
googoolguyyah." And inanswer comes thewailing ofthe
gloomy-looking balah trees, and then arustling shirr
through thebibbil branches, until atlastevery tree gives
forth itsvoice andmakes sadthemargin ofthelake with
echoes ofthepast.
Butthemenandboyswhowere attheplace ofthe little
borah escaped themetamorphosis. They waited long for
thearrival ofthetribeswhonever came.
"At last,"Byamee said: "Surely mighty enemies have
slain ourfriends, andnotoneescapes totellusoftheir fate.
Evennowthese enemies maybeupon ourtrack ;letusgo
intoafarcountry."
And swiftly theywent toNoondoo. Hurrying along

Bunnyyarl theFlies andWurrun-
nunnah theBees
TheBunnyyarl andWurrunnunnah were relations, and
lived inonecamp. TheWurrunnunnah were very hard-
working, always trying togather food inatime of
plenty, tolay inastore foratime offamine. The
Bunnyyarl used togivenoheed tothefuture, butused
towaste their time playing round any rubbish, and
never thinking even oflaying upany provisions. One
day theWurrunnunnah said, "Come outwith usand
gather honey from flowers. Soon will thewinter winds
blow theflowers away, and there willbenomorehoney
togather."
"No," said theBunnyyarl, "wehavesomething tolook
tohere." And offtheywent, turning oversome rubbish
andwasting their time, knowing whatever theWurrun-
nunnah brought they would share with them. The
Wurrunnunnah went alone and lefttheBunnyyarl totheir
rubbish. TheWurrunnunnah gathered theflowers and
stored thehoney, andnever more went back tolive


Bunnyyarl the Flies 107
with theBunnyyarls, fortheywere tired ofdoing all
thework.
Astimewent ontheWurrunnunnah were changed into
little wild bees, and thelazy Bunnyyarls were changed
into flies.


Deegeenboyah theSoldier-bird
Deegeenboyah wasanoldman,andgetting pasthunting
much forhimself; andhefound ithard tokeep histwo
wives andhistwodaughters supplied with food. Hecamped
with hisfamily away from theother tribes, butheused to
join themen oftheMullyan tribewhen theywere going
outhunting, andsogetamore certain supply offood than
ifhehadgone byhimself. Onedaywhen theMullyan
went out,hewastoolate toaccompany them. Hehidin
thescrub and waited fortheir return, atsome little
distance from their camp. When theywere coming back
heheard them singing theSong oftheSetting Emu, a
song which whoever finds the first emu's nest ofthe
season always sings before getting back tothecamp.
Deegeenboyah jumped upasheheard thesong, andstarted
towards thecamp oftheMullyan singing thesame song, asif
hetoohadfound anest. Onthey allwent towards the
camp singjoyously :
"Nurdoo, nurbber mederreen derreenbah, ah,ah,ah,ah,ah.
Garmbay booan yunnahdeh beahwah ah,ah,ah,ah,ah.
Gubbondee, dee, ee,ee,ee.
Neah nean gulbeejah, ah,ah,ah,ah."


Deegeenboyah theSoldier-bird 109
Which song roughly translated means :
"Isaw itfirstamongst theyoung trees,
Thewhitemark onitsforehead,
Thewhite mark thatbefore Ihadonlyseen asthe
emusmoved together intheday-time.
Never didIseeonecamp before, onlymoving, moving
always.
Now thatwehavefound thenest
Wemust lookouttheantsdonotgettotheeggs.
Iftheycrawl overthem theeggs arespoilt."
Asthe lastecho ofthesong diedaway, those inthe
camp tookuptherefrain andsang itback tothehunters to
letthemknow thattheyunderstood thattheyhadfound
thefirstemu's nest oftheseason.
When thehunters reached thecamp, upcame Deegeen-
boyah too.TheMuUyans turned tohim,andsaid :
"Didyoufindanemu's nest too?"
"Yes," saidDeegeenboyah, "Idid. Ithink youmust
havefound thesame, though after me,asIsawnotyour
tracks. But Iamolder and stiff" inmylimbs, socame not
back soquickly. Tellme,where isyour nest ?"
"Intheclump oftheGoolahbahs, ontheedge ofthe
plain," saidtheunsuspecting Mullyan.
"Ah, Ithought so.That ismine. Butwhat matter.?
Wecanshare—there willbeplenty for all.Wemust get
thenetandgoandcamp nearthenest to-night, andto-morrow
traptheemu."
TheMullyan gottheiremu trapping net,onemade of
thinropeabout asthick asathin clothes line, about five
feethigh, andbetween twoandthree hundred yards long.
And offthey set,accompanied byDeegeenboyah, tqcamp near
where theemuwas setting. When theyhadchoSen aplace
tocamp, theyhad their supper andalittle corrobboree,

illustrative ofslaying emu, etc.Thenextmorning atday-
light they erected their netintoasortoftriangular shaped
yard, onesideopen. Black fellows were stationed ateach
endofthenet,and atstated distances along it.The net
wasupheld byupright poles. When thenetwas fixed,
some oirtheblacks made awide circle round theemu's
nest, leaving open thesidetowards thenet. They closed
ingradually until they frightened theemu offthe nest.
Theemu seeing black fellows onevery side butone,ran
inthat direction. The blacks followed closely, and the
birdwassoon yarded. Madly thefrightened birdrushed
against thenet.Upranablack fellow, seized thebird
andwrung itsneck. Thensome ofthemwent back tothe
nest togettheeggs, which they baked intheashes of
their fireand ate.Theymade ahole tocook theemu in.
They plucked theemu.When theyhadplenty ofcoals,
theyputathick layer atthebottom ofthehole, some
twigs ofleaves ontopofthecoals, some feathers onthetop
ofthem. Then they laidtheemu in,more feathers onthe
topof it,leaves again ontopofthem, andoverthem a
thick layer ofcoals, and lastly theycovered allwith earth.
Itwould beseveral hours incooking, soDeegeenboyah
said, "Iwillstayandcook theemu,youyoung fellows take
moonoons—emu spears—andtryandgetsomemore emu."
TheMuUyan thought there was sense inthispro-
posal, sotheytook acouple oflong spears, with ajagged
nick atoneend, tohold theemuwhen they speared it;
they stuck afewemu feathers ontheendofeach spear
andwent off.They soonsawaflock ofemucoming past
where the^ were waiting towater. Two oftheparty

andputthese thickly beneath them, soastoscreen them
from theemu. Then astheemucame near tothemen
theydangled down their spears, letting theemu feathers on
theendswave toand fro.Theemu, seeing thefeathers,
were curious astohowthey gotthere, came over, craning
their necks andsniffing right underneath thespears. The
black fellows tightly grasped themoonoons anddrove them
with force into thetwoemu theyhad picked. Oneemu
dropped dead atonce. Theother ranwith thespear init
forashort distance, buttheblack fellow was quickly after
it,andsooncaught and killed itoutright. Then carrying
thedead birds, back theywent towhere Deegeenboyah was
cooking theother emu. They cooked thetwotheyhad
brought, andthen allstarted forthecamp ingreat spirits at
their successful chase. They began throwing their
mooroolahs asthey went along, andplaying with their
bubberahs, orreturning boomerangs. OldDeegeenboyah
said, "Here, givemetheemus tocarry, andthenyou will
befree tohave areally goodgame withyour mooroolahs
andbubberahs, andseewho isthebestman."
They gave him theemus, andonthey went, some
throwing mooroolahs, andsome showing their skill with
bubberahs. Presently Deegeenboyah satdown. They
thought hewas just resting forafewminutes, soranon
laughing and playing, each good throw eliciting another
effort, fornone likedowning themselves beaten while they
had amooroolah left.Asthey got further away they
noticed Deegeenboyah was still sitting down, sothey called
outtohim toknow whatwasthematter. "Allright," he
said, "only having arest ;shall come oninaminute."
Soonthey went. When theywere quite outofsight
y

Deegeenboyah jumped upquickly, tookuptheemus and
made foranopening intheground atalittle distance.
Thisopening wasthedoor oftheunderground home ofthe
Murgah Muggui spider—theopening wasaneat covering,
like asort oftrap door. Down through thishewent,
taking theemus with him,knowing therewasanother exit
atsome distance, outofwhich hecould comeupquite near
hishome, for itwasthewayheoften took after hunting.
TheMullyans wenthome andwaited, butnosign of
Deegeenboyah. Then backontheir tracks theywent and
called aloud, butgotnoanswer, andsawnosign. Atlast
MuUyangah thechief oftheMullyans, saidhewould find
him. Arming himself with hisboondees and spears, he
went back towhere hehad lastseenDeegeenboyah sitting.
Hesawwhere histracks turned offandwhere they
disappeared, butcould notaccount fortheir disappearance,

wentupto itandsawonlytwo little girls playing about,
whom heknew were thedaughters ofDeegeenboyah.
"Where isyour father .'"heasked them.
"Outhunting," they said.
"Which waydoeshecomehome ?"
"Ourfather comes home outofthis;"andtheyshowed

Offjumped oneofthe girls towards hisoutstretched

stepping aside, lethercome with her fullforce tothe

horror-stricken child onthetree :"Come, jump. Your

«No, Iamafraid."
"Come on, Iwillbeready thistime. Now come."
"Iamafraid."
"Come on;Iamstrong." Andhesmiled quite kindly
upatthechild, who, hesitating nolonger, jumped towards

"Now," saidMullyangah, "here come thetwowives.
Imust silence them, orwhen they seetheir children their

hesneaked behind atree,andasthetwowives passed he
struck them dead with hisspears. Then hewent tothe
trapdoor thatthechildren hadshown him,andsatdown to-
wait forthecoming ofDeegeenboyah. Hehadnotlong to

cooked emu,which hecaught hold ofand laidonone side..
Deegeenboyah thought itwas the girls taking it,asthey

"Ah," saidMullyangah, "you stole ourfoodandnow
you shall die. I've killed your children."
Deegeenboyah looked wildly round, and,seeing the.dead
bodies ofhis girls beneath theleaning tree, hegroaned
aloud.
"And," went onMullyangah, "I've killed your wives."
Deegeenboyah raised his.head andlooked again wildly
round, andthere, ontheirhomeward path, hesaw hisdead

"Not so,"saidMullyangah, "noman lives tosteal twice

them withhim,went swiftly back tohiscamp.
Andmerry wasthesupper thatnightwhen theMullyans

was useless, forOolah hadonly heryam stick, while
Wayambeh hadhisspears andboondees. Wayambeh took
thewoman andherchildren tohiscamp. His tribewhen

fighting weapons.
When theWayambeh sawtheapproach oftheOolah,
their chief said :"Now,Wayambeh, youhadbetter goout

Wayambeh chose thetwobiggest boreens thathehad;

When hewaswelloutontotheplain, though stillsome

men :"Goyou, takeyourcomeboos.and cutbark sufficient
tomake dardurr forallthetribe."
Theyoung men didastheywere bade. When theyhad
thebark cutandbrought inWirreenun said :"Go you
nowandraise withant-bed ahigh place, andputthereon
logsandwood forafire, build theant-bed about afoot
from theground. Then putyouafloor ofant-bed afoot
highwherever youaregoing tobuild adardurr."
And they didwhat hetoldthem. When thedardurr
were finished, having high floors ofant-bed andwater-tight
roofs ofbark,Wirreenun commanded thewhole camp to
come withhimtothewaterhole ;men,women, andchildren;
allwere tocome. They allfollowed himdown tothe
creek, tothewaterhole where hehadplaced thewillgoo
willgoo andgubberah. Wirreenun jumped intothewater
andbade thetribe follow him,which they did. There in
thewater they allsplashed andplayed about. After a
little timeWirreenun wentupfirstbehind oneblack fellow
andthenbehind another, until atlength hehadbeenround
them all,andtaken from theback ofeach one's head
lumps ofcharcoal. When hewentuptoqachheappeared
tosuck theback ortopoftheir heads, and todraw out
lumps ofcharcoal, which, ashesucked them out,hespat

intothewater. When hehadgone theround ofall,he
went outofthewater. But just ashegotoutayoung
mancaught himupinhisarms andthrew himback into
thewater. Thishappened several times, untilWirreenun
was shivering. That was thesignal for alltoleave the
creek. Wirreenun sent alltheyoung people intoabig
bough shed, andbadethem allgotoAleep. Heandtwo
oldmenandtwooldwomen stayed outside. They loaded
themselves with alltheir belongings piledupontheir backs,
dayoorl stones and all,asifready foraflitting. These old
people walked impatiently around thebough shed asif
waiting asignal tostart somewhere. Soon abigblack
cloud appeared onthehorizon, first asingle cloud, which,
however, wassoon followed byothers rising allround.
They rosequickly until they allmetjustoverhead, forming
abigblack mass ofclouds. Assoon asthis big,heavy,
rainladen looking cloud was stationary overhead, theold
people went into thebough shed andbade theyoung
people wake upandcome outand look atthesky.
When theywere allroused Wirreenun toldthem toloseno
time, buttogather together alltheir possessions andhasten
togain theshelter ofthebark dardurr. Scarcely were they
allinthedardurrs andtheir spears wellhidden when there
sounded aterrific clap ofthunder, which was quickly
followed byaregular cannonade, lightning flashes shooting
across thesky,followed byinstantaneous claps ofdeafening
thunder. Asudden flash oflightning, which litapathway
fromheaven toearth, wasfollowed bysuch aterrific clash
that theblacks thought their very camps were struck..
But itwas atreealittle distance off.Theblacks huddled
together intheir dardurrs, frightened tomove, thechildren


Wirreenun theRainmaker 123
crying with fear,andthedogs crouching towards theip
owners.
"We shall bekilled," shrieked thewomen. Themen
saidnothing butlooked asfrightened.
OnlyWirreenun was fearless. "Iwillgoout," hesaid,
"andstop thestorm from hurting us.The lightning shall
come nonearer."
Sooutinfront ofthedardurrs strode Wirreenun, and
naked hestood there facing thestorm, singing aloud, asthe
thunder roared andthelightning flashed, thechant which
wastokeep itaway from thecamp :
"Gurreemooray, mooray,
Durreemooray, mooray, mooray," &c.
Sooncame alullinthecannonade, aslight breeze stirred
thetrees forafewmoments, thenanoppressive silence, and
then therain inrealearnest began, andsettled down toa
steady downpour, which lasted forsome days.
When theoldpeople hadbeen patrolling thebough shed
astheclouds rose overhead, Wirreenun hadgone tothe
waterhole andtaken outthewillgoo willgoo andthestones,
forhesawbythecloud that theirworkwasdone.
When therainwasoverandthecountry allgreen again,
theblacks hadagreat corrobboree andsang ofthe skillof
Wirreenun, rainmaker totheNoongahburrah.
Wirreenun satcalmandheedless oftheir praise, ashe
hadbeen oftheir murmurs. Buthedetermined toshow
them that hispowers were great, sohesummoned therain-
maker ofaneighbouring tribe, and aftersome consultation
with him,heordered thetribes togototheGoogoorewon,
which wasthen adryplain, with thesolemn, gaunt trees all
round it,which hadoncebeen black fellows.


124 Australian Tales
When theywere allcamped round theedges ofthis
plain, Wirreenun andhisfellow rainmaker made agreat rain
tofalljustover theplainand fill itwith water.
When theplainwaschanged intoalake,Wirreenun said
totheyoung men ofhistribe :"Now takeyour netsand
fish."
"What good ?"said they. "The lake isfilled from the
rain, nottheflood water ofrivers, filled butyesterday, how
then shall there befish?"
"Go," said.Wirreenun. "Go asIbidyou; fish. If
your nets catch nothing then shall Wirreenun speak no
more tothemenofhistribe, hewillseekonlyhoney and
yams with thewomen."
More toplease themanwhohadchanged their country
from adesert toahunter's paradise, they didashebade
them, took their netsandwent into thelake. And the
firsttimetheydrew their nets,theywereheavy withgoodoo,
murree, tucki, and bunmillah. And somany didthey
catch that allthetribes, and theirdogshadplenty.
Then theelders ofthecamp saidnow that there was
plenty everywhere, theywould have aborah that theboys
should bemadeyoung men. Ononeoftheridges away
from thecamp, that thewomen should notknow, would
they prepare aground.
Andsowasthebigborah oftheGoogoorewon held, the
borah which wasfamous asfollowing onthetriumph of
Wirreenun therainmaker.
