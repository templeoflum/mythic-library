IN
GRATITUDE ANDADMIRATION




PREFACE
Forsome time Ihavebeen preparing ageneral work
onprimitive superstition and religion. Among the
problems which had attracted myattention wasthe
hitherto unexplained rule oftheArician priesthood;
and lastspring ithappened that inthecourse ofmy
reading Icame across some facts which, combined
with others Ihadnoted before, suggested anexplana-
tion oftherule inquestion. Astheexplanation, if
correct, promised tothrow light onsome obscure
features ofprimitive religion, Iresolved todevelop it
fully, and,detaching itfrommygeneral work, toissue
itasaseparate study. Thisbook istheresult.
Now thatthetheory, which necessarily presented
itself tomeatfirst inoutline, hasbeenworked outin
detail, Icannot but feelthat insome places Imay
havepushed ittoo far. Ifthisshould prove tohave
been thecase, Iwillreadily acknowledge and retract
myerror assoon asitisbrought home tome.Mean-
timemyessaymayserve itspurpose asafirstattempt
tosolve adifficult problem, and tobring avariety of
scattered facts intosome sortoforder andsystem.
Ajustification isperhaps needed ofthelength at
which Ihavedwelt upon thepopular festivals observed


PREFACE
byEuropean peasants inspring, atmidsummer, and at
harvest. Itcanhardly betoooften repeated, since it
isnotyetgenerally recognised, that inspite oftheir
fragmentary character thepopular superstitions and
customs ofthepeasantry arebyfarthe fullest and
most trustworthy evidence wepossess astotheprimi-
tive religion oftheAryans. Indeed theprimitive
Aryan, inallthatregards hismental fibreandtexture,
isnotextinct. He isamongst ustothis day.The
great intellectual andmoral forces which have revolu-
tionised theeducated world have scarcely affected
thepeasant. Inhisinmost beliefs he iswhat his
forefathers were inthedayswhen forest trees still
grewand squirrels played ontheground whereRome
andLondon now stand.
Hence every inquiry intotheprimitive religion of
theAryans should either start from thesuperstitious
beliefs andobservances ofthepeasantry, orshould at
leastbeconstantly checked andcontrolled byreference
tothem. Compared with theevidence afforded by
living tradition, thetestimony ofancient books onthe
subject ofearly religion isworth very little. For
literature accelerates theadvance ofthought ata
ratewhich leaves theslow progress ofopinion by
word ofmouth atanimmeasurable distance behind.
Two orthree generations ofliterature maydomore
tochange thought thantwoorthree thousand years
oftraditional life. Butthemass ofthepeople who
donotreadbooks remain unaffected bythemental
revolution wrought byliterature;andso ithascome
about that inEurope atthepresent daythesupersti-
tious beliefs and practices which have been handed


PREFACE
down byword ofmouth aregenerally ofafarmore
archaic type than thereligion depicted inthemost
ancient'literature oftheAryan race.
Itisonthese grounds that, indiscussing the
meaning andorigin ofanancient Italian priesthood, I
havedevoted somuch attention tothepopular customs
andsuperstitions ofmodern Europe. Inthispartof
mysubject Ihavemade great useoftheworks ofthe
lateW.Mannhardt, without which, indeed, mybook
could scarcely have been written. Fully recognising
thetruth oftheprinciples which Ihave imperfectly
stated, Mannhardt sethimself systematically tocollect,
compare, andexplain theliving superstitions ofthe
peasantry. Ofthiswide fieldthespecial department
which hemarked out forhimself wasthereligion of
thewoodman andthefarmer, inother words, the
superstitious beliefs and ritesconnected with treesand
cultivated plants. Byoral inquiry, andbyprinted
questions scattered broadcast over Europe, aswell as
byransacking theliterature offolk-lore, hecollected
amass ofevidence, part ofwhich hepublished ina
series ofadmirable works. But hishealth, always
feeble, brokedown before hecould complete thecom-
prehensive and really vastscheme which hehad
planned, and athistooearly death much ofhispre-
cious materials remained unpublished. Hismanu-
scripts arenowdeposited intheUniversity Library at
Berlin, and intheinterest ofthestudy towhich he
devoted his life itisgreatly tobedesired thatthey
should beexamined, andthatsuch portions ofthem as
hehasnotutilised inhisbooks should begiven to
theworld.


PREFACE
Ofhispublished works themost important are,
first,two tracts, Roggenzuolf itndRoggenJnmd, Danzig
1865 (second edition, Danzig, 1866), andDieKornd'd-
vionen, Berlin, 186S. These little works were put
forward byhim tentatively, inthehope ofexciting
interest inhisinquiries andthereby securing thehelp
ofothers inpursuing them. But, except from afew
learned societies, theymetwith very little attention.
Undeterred bythecold reception accorded tohis
efforts heworked steadily on,and in1875 published
hischief work,Der Baunikiiltus derGcrmancn tind
iJirer NacJibarstamnie. This was followed in1877
byAntike Wald- iLudFeldkulte. HisMytJwlogischc
Forsc/mngeu, aposthumous work, appeared in1884.^
Much as Iowe toMannhardt, Iowe stillmore to
myfriend Professor W.Robertson Smith. Myinterest
intheearly history ofsociety was firstexcited bythe
works ofDr.E.B.Tylor, which opened upamental
vistaundreamed ofbymebefore. But itisalong
stepfrom alively interest inasubject toasystematic
study of it;and that Itook this step isdue tothe
influence ofmyfriend W.Robertson Smith. The
debtwhich Iowe tothevast stores ofhisknowledge,
theabundance and fertility ofhis ideas, and his
unwearied kindness, can scarcely beoverestimated.
Those whoknow hiswritings mayform some, though
avery inadequate, conception oftheextent towhich I
havebeen influenced byhim. Theviews ofsacrifice

THEKING OFTHEWOOD

TheArician Grove
Who does notknow Turner's picture oftheGolden
Bough ?The scene, suffused with thegolden glow
ofimagination inwhich thedivine mind ofTurner
steeped and transfigured even the fairest natural
landscape, isadream-like vision ofthe littlewood-
land lake ofNemi, "Diana's Mirror," asitwascalled
bytheancients. Noonewho hasseen thatcalm
water, lapped inagreen hollow oftheAlban hills,
canever forget it.Thetwo characteristic Italian
villages which slumber on itsbanks, andtheequally
Italian palazzo whose terraced gardens descend steeply
tothelake, hardly break the stillness andeven the
solitariness ofthescene. Dian herself might still
linger bythis lonely shore, stillhaunt these wood-
lands wild.
VOL. I B


THEARICIAN GROVE
Inantiquity thissylvan landscape was thescene
ofastrange andrecurring tragedy. Onthenorthern
shore ofthelake, right under theprecipitous cliffson
which themodern village ofNemi isperched, stood
thesacred grove andsanctuary ofDiana Nemorensis,
orDiana oftheWood.^ The lakeandthegrove
were sometimes known asthelakeandgrove of
Aricia.- But thetown ofAricia (themodern La
Riccia) was situated about three miles off,atthefoot
oftheAlban Mount, andseparated byasteep descent
from thelake,which liesinasmall crater-like hollow
onthemountain side. Inthissacred grove there
grew acertain treeround which atanytime ofthe
dayandprobably farinto thenight astrange figure
might beseen toprowl. Inhishand hecarried a
drawn sword, andhekept peering warily about him
asifevery instant heexpected tobesetupon byan
enemy. ^Hewasapriest andamurderer ;andthe
man forwhom helooked was sooner orlater to
murder himand hold thepriesthood inhisstead.
Suchwastheruleofthesanctuary. Acandidate for
thepriesthood could onlysucceed tooffice byslaying
thepriest, andhaving slainhimheheld office tillhe
washimself slainbyastronger oracraftier.
This strange rule hasnoparallel inclassical
antiquity, andcannot beexplained from it.Tofind

probably deny thatsuch acustom savours ofabarbar-

ousageand,surviving intoimperial times, stands out
instriking isolation from thepolished Italian society of
theday, likeaprimeval rock rising from asmooth-
shaven lawn. Itisthevery rudeness andbarbarity of
thecustom which allow usahope ofexplaining it.
Forrecent researches intotheearly history ofman
have revealed theessential similarity withwhich, under
many superficial differences, thehuman mind has
elaborated itsfirstcrude philosophy oflife. Accord-
ingly ifwecanshow thatabarbarous custom, likethat
ofthepriesthood ofNemi, hasexisted elsewhere;ifwe
candetect themotives which ledtoitsinstitution;if
wecanprove thatthese motives have operated widely,
perhaps universally, inhuman society, producing in
varied circumstances avariety ofinstitutions specifically
different butgenerically alike ;ifwecanshow, lastly,
that these very motives, withsome oftheir derivative
institutions, were actually atwork inclassical antiquity;
thenwemay fairly infer that ataremoter agethesame
motives gave birth tothepriesthood ofNemi. Such
aninference, indefault ofdirect evidence astohowthe
priesthood did actually arise, cannever amount to
demonstration. But itwillbemore orlessprobable
according tothedegree ofcompleteness withwhich it
fulfils theconditions indicated above. The object of
thisbook is,bymeeting these conditions, tooffer a
fairly probable explanation ofthepriesthood ofNemi.
Ibegin bysetting forth thefewfactsandlegends
which havecomedown tousonthesubject. According
toonestory theworship ofDiana atNemi was insti-
tuted byOrestes, who, after killing Thoas, King ofthe
Tauric Chersonese (theCrimea), fledwith hissister to
Italy, bringing withhimtheimage oftheTauric Diana.
Thebloody ritual which legend ascribed tothatgoddess


THEARICIAN GROVE
isfamiliar toclassical readers;itissaid thatevery
stranger wholanded ontheshore wassacrificed onher
altar. Buttransported toItaly, the riteassumed a
milder form. Within thesanctuary atNemi grew a
certain treeofwhich nobranch might bebroken.
Only arunaway slave wasallowed tobreak off, ifhe
could, oneofitsboughs. Success intheattempt en-
titledhimtofight thepriest insingle combat, and ifhe
slewhimhereigned inhisstead with the titleofKing
oftheWood {Rex Nemoj^ensis). Tradition averred
thatthefateful branch wasthatGolden Bough which, at
theSibyl's bidding, Aeneas plucked before heessayed
theperilous journey totheworld ofthedead. The
flight oftheslave represented, itwas said, the flight
ofOrestes;hiscombat with thepriest wasareminis-
cence ofthehuman sacrifices once offered totheTauric
Diana. This ruleofsuccession bythesword was
observed down toimperial times ;foramongst his
other freaks Caligula, thinking thatthepriest ofNemi
hadheld office toolong, hired amore stalwart ruffian
toslayhim.^
Oftheworship ofDiana atNemi two leading
features can stillbemade out. First, from thevotive-
oflerings found inmodern times onthe site, itappears
thatshewasespecially worshipped bywomen desirous
ofchildren orofaneasy delivery.- Second, fireseems

tohave played aforemost part inher ritual. For
during herannual festival, celebrated atthehottest time
oftheyear, hergrove was litupbyamultitude of
torches, whose ruddy glarewasreflected bythewaters
ofthelake;andthroughout thelength andbreadth of
Italy thedaywaskeptwithholy rites atevery domestic
hearth.^ Moreover, women whose prayers hadbeen
heard bythegoddess brought lighted torches tothe
grove infulfilment oftheir vows.- Lastly, the titleof
Vesta borne bytheArician Diana^points almost
certainly tothemaintenance ofaperpetual holy firein
hersanctuary.
Atherannual festival allyoung people wentthrough
apurificatory ceremony inherhonour ;dogs were
crowned;andthefeast consisted ofayoung kid,wine,
andcakes, served uppiping hotonplatters ofleaves.^
ButDiana didnotreign alone inhergrove at
Nemi. Two lesser divinities shared herforest sanctu-
ary.Onewas Egeria, thenymph oftheclear water
which, bubbling from thebasaltic rocks, used tofallin
graceful cascades intothelake attheplace called Le
Mole.^ According toonestory thegrove was first
consecrated toDiana byaManius Egerius, whowas
theancestor ofalonganddistinguished line. Hence
theproverb "There aremany Manii atAriciae."
Others explained theproverb very differently. They
said itmeant that there were agreatmany uglyand

deformed people, andthey referred tothewordMania
which meant abogey orbugbear tofrighten children.^
The other ofthese minor deities was Virbius.
Legend had itthat Virbius wastheyouthful Greek
hero Hippolytus, whohadbeen killed byhishorses
onthesea-shore oftheSaronic Gulf. Him, toplease
Diana, theleech Aesculapius brought tolifeagain by
hissimples. ButJupiter, indignant thatamortal man
should return from thegates ofdeath, thrust down
themeddling leech himself toHades;andDiana, for
thelove shebore Hippolytus, carried himaway to
Italy and hidhimfrom theangry god inthedells
ofNemi, where hereigned aforest king under
thename ofVirbius. Horses were excluded from
thegrove andsanctuary, because horses had killed
Hippolytus." Some thought that Virbius was the
sun. Itwas unlawful totouch hisimage.^ His
worship wascared forbyaspecial priest, theFlamen
Virbialis.*
Such then arethefactsandtheories bequeathed to
usbyantiquity onthesubject ofthepriesthood of
Nemi. From materials soslight and scanty itis
impossible toextract asolution oftheproblem. It
remains totrywhether thesurvey ofawider fieldmay
notyield ustheclueweseek. The questions tobe
answered aretwo :first,whyhadthepriest toslay his
predecessor ?andsecond, why, before heslewhim,had
hetopluck theGolden Bough'^.The restofthis
book willbeanattempt toanswer these questions.

PRIESTLY KINGS
§2,—
Primitive vianandthesiipernatiLral
The first point onwhich wefasten isthe priest's
title.Why washecalled theKing oftheWood ?
whywashisoffice spoken ofasaKingdom ?^
Theunion ofaroyal titlewith priestly duties was
common inancient ItalyandGreece. AtRome and
inother Italian cities there wasapriest called the
Sacrificial King orKing oftheSacred Rites i^Rex
Sacrificulus orRexSacroncm), and hiswifebore the
title ofQueen oftheSacred Rites.- Inrepublican
Athens thesecond magistrate ofthestatewascalled
theKing, and hiswife theQueen;thefunctions of
bothwere religious." Many other Greek democracies
had titular kings, whose duties, sofarasthey are
known, seem tohave been priestly.^ AtRome the
tradition was that the Sacrificial King hadbeen
appointed after theexpulsion ofthekings inorder to
offer thesacrifices which hadbeen previously offered
bythekings.^ InGreece asimilar view appears to
have prevailed astotheorigin ofthepriestly kings.*^
Initself theview isnotimprobable, and itisborne out
bytheexample ofSparta, theonlypurely Greek state
which retained thekingly form ofgovernment in
historical times. For inSparta allstate sacrifices were
offered bythekings asdescendants ofthegod,^ This
combination ofpriestly functions with royal authority
isfamiliar toevery one. Asia Minor, forexample,

PRIESTLY KINGS
bythousands of"sacred slaves," andruled bypontiffs
whowielded atonce temporal and spiritual authority,
likethepopes ofmediaeval Rome, Such priest-ridden
cities were ZelaandPessinus.^ Teutonic kings, again,
intheoldheathen daysseem tohave stood inthe
position, andexercised thepowers ofhigh priests.-
TheEmperors ofChina offer public sacrifices, the
details ofwhich areregulated bytheritual books." It
isneedless, however, tomultiply examples ofwhat is
therulerather than theexception intheearly history
ofthekingship.
Butwhenwehave saidthattheancient kings were
commonly priests also,weare farfrom having ex-
hausted thereligious aspect oftheir office. Inthose
days thedivinity thathedges akingwasnoempty
form ofspeech buttheexpression ofasober belief.
Kings were revered, inmany cases notmerely as
priests, that is,asintercessors between manandgod,
butasthemselves gods, able tobestow upon their
subjects andworshippers those blessings which are
commonly supposed tobebeyond thereach ofman,
andaresought, ifatall,onlybyprayer and sacrifice
offered tosuperhuman and invisible beings. Thus
kings areoften expected togive rainandsunshine in
due season, tomake thecrops grow, and soon.
Strange asthisexpectation appears tous, itisquite
ofapiece with earlymodes ofthought. Asavage
hardly conceives thedistinction commonly drawn by
more advanced peoples between thenatural andthe
supernatural. Tohim theworld ismostly worked
bysupernatural agents, that is,bypersonal beings

acting onimpulses andmotives like hisown, liable
likehim tobemoved byappeals totheir pity, their
fears, and their hopes. Inaworld soconceived he
seesnolimit tohispower ofinfluencing thecourse of
nature tohisown advantage. Prayers, promises, or
threats maysecure him fineweather andanabundant
cropfrom thegods;and ifagodshould happen, as
hesometimes believes, tobecome incarnate inhisown
person, thenheneed appeal tonohigher power;he,
thesavage, possesses inhimself allthesupernatural
powers necessary tofurther hisown well-being and
thatofhisfellow men.
This isoneway inwhich theidea ofaman-god
isreached. Butthere isanother. Sidebysidewith
theview oftheworld aspervaded byspiritual forces,
primitive man hasanother conception inwhich we
maydetect agerm ofthemodern notion ofnatural law
ortheview ofnature asaseries ofevents occurring in
aninvariable order without theintervention ofpersonal
agency. Thegerm ofwhich Ispeak isinvolved in
thatsympathetic magic, as itmaybecalled, which
plays alarge part inmost systems ofsuperstition.
Oneoftheprinciples ofsympathetic magic isthatany
effectmaybeproduced byimitating it.Totake afew
instances. Ifitiswished tokillaperson animage
ofhim ismade andthendestroyed ;and itisbelieved
thatthrough acertain physical sympathy between the
person and hisimage, theman feels theinjuries done
totheimage asiftheyweredone tohisownbody, and
thatwhen itisdestroyed hemust simultaneously perish.
Again, inMorocco afowl orapigeon maysometimes

bundle contains acharm, and itisbelieved that asthe
charm iskept inconstant motion bythebirdacorre-

sponding restlessness iskeptupinthemind ofhimor
heragainst whom thecharm isdirected.^ InNias
when awild pighasfallen intothepitprepared for it,
itistaken outand itsback isrubbed with nine fallen
leaves, inthebelief that this willmake ninemore wild
pigs fallintothe pitjust asthenine leaves fellfrom

andtaken nothing, hestrips himself naked, goessome
way off,then strolls uptothenetasifhedidnotsee

this? I'mafraid I'mcaught." After that thenet is
sure tocatch game.^ InThiiringen themanwhosows

Itisbelieved that this willcause theflaxcrop towave

pathy issupposed toexist between amanandany
severed portion ofhisperson, ashishairornails;so
thatwhoever getspossession ofhairornailsmaywork
his will, atanydistance, upon theperson fromwhom
they were cut. This superstition isworld -wide.
Further, thesympathy inquestion exists between
friends and relations, especially atcritical times.

SYMPATHETIC MAGIC
regulates theconduct ofpersons leftathome while a
party oftheir friends isoutfishing orhunting oron
thewar-path. Itisthought that ifthepersons leftat
home broke these rules their absent friends would
suffer aninjury, corresponding initsnature tothe
breach oftherule. Thuswhen aDyak isouthead-
hunting, hiswife or, ifheisunmarried, hissister, must
wear asword dayandnight inorder thathemay
always bethinking ofhisweapons ;andshemaynot
sleep during thedaynorgotobedbefore two inthe
morning, lestherhusband orbrother should thereby

anelephant hunter issetting outforthechase hewarns
hiswife not tocutherhair oroilherbody inhis
absence;for ifshecutherhair theelephant would
burst the toils, ifsheoiled herself itwould slipthrough
them."
Inallthese cases (and similar instances might be
multiplied indefinitely) anaction isperformed or
avoided, because itsperformance isbelieved toentail
good orbadconsequenpes ofasortresembling theact
itself. Sometimes themagic sympathy takes effect
notsomuch through anactasthrough asupposed
resemblance ofqualities. Thussome Bechuanas wear
aferret asacharm because, being very tenacious of
life, itwillmake them difficult tokill.^ Others wear a
certain insect, mutilated but living, forasimilar pur-

Thusweseethat insympathetic magic oneevent
issupposed tobefollowed necessarily andinvariably
byanother, without theintervention ofanyspiritual or
personal agency. This is,infact,themodern concep-
tionofphysical causation;theconception, indeed, is
misapplied, but itisthere none the less. Here, then,
wehaveanother mode inwhich primitive manseeks to
bend nature tohiswishes. There is,perhaps, hardly
asavage whodoes notfancy himself possessed ofthis
power ofinfluencing thecourse ofnature bysympa-
thetic magic; aman-god, onthis view, isonlyan
individual who isbelieved toenjoy thiscommon power
inanunusually high degree. Thus, whereas aman-
godoftheformer orinspired type derives hisdivinity
from adeitywhohastaken uphisabode inatabernacle
offlesh, aman-god ofthelatter typedraws hissuper-
natural power from acertain physical sympathy with
nature. He isnotmerely thereceptacle ofadivine
spirit. Hiswhole being, bodyand soul, issodelicately
attuned totheharmony oftheworld thatatouch ofhis
hand oraturnofhisheadmaysend athrill vibrating
through theuniversal framework ofthings;andcon-
versely hisdivine organism isacutely sensitive tosuch
slight changes ofenvironment aswould leave ordinary
mortals wholly unaffected. Butthelinebetween these

natural law,thebelief ofprimitive man thathecanrule
theelements must besoforeign that itmaybewell to
illustrate itbyexamples. When wehave seen that in
early society menwhomake nopretence atallofbeing
godsdonevertheless commonly believe themselves to
beinvested with supernatural powers, weshall have
theless difficulty incomprehending theextraordinary
range ofpowers ascribed toindividuals whoareactually
regarded asdivine.
Of allnatural phenomena there areperhaps none
which civilised man feels himself more powerless to
influence than the rain, thesun,andthewind. Yet
allthese arecommonly supposed bysavages tobein
some degree under their control.
Tobegin with rain-making. Inavillage near
Dorpat inRussia, when rainwasmuch wanted, three
menused toclimb upthe fir-trees ofanoldsacred
grove. One ofthemdrummed with ahammer ona
kettle orsmall cask toimitate thunder ;thesecond
knocked twofire-brands together andmade thesparks
fly,toimitate lightning;andthethird,whowascalled
"the rain-maker," hadabunch oftwigs withwhich he
sprinkled water from avessel onallsides.^ This isan
example ofsympathetic magic;thedesired event is
supposed tobeproduced byimitating it.Rain isoften
thusmade byimitation. InHalmahera (Gilolo), a
large island tothewest ofNew Guinea, awizard
makes rainbydipping abranch ofaparticular kind of
tree inwater andsprinkling theground with it.- In
Ceram itisenough todedicate thebark ofacertain

thewater isused asathreat ;butoriginally itwas
probably asympathetic charm, asinthefollowing
instance. InNewCaledonia therain-makers blackened
themselves allover,dugupadead body, tookthebones
toacave, jointed them, andhung theskeleton over
some taroleaves. Water waspoured over theskeleton
torundown ontheleaves. "They supposed thatthe
soul ofthedeparted tookupthewater, made rainof
it,andshowered itdown again."^Thesame motive
comes clearly out inamode ofmaking rainwhich is
practised byvarious peoples ofSouth Eastern Europe.
Intime ofdrought theServians strip agirl,clothe her
fromhead tofoot ingrass, herbs, andflowers, evenher
facebeing hidden with them. Thus disguised she is
called theDodola, andgoesthrough thevillage with a
troop ofgirls. They stop before every house;the
Dodola dances, while theother girlsform aringround
hersinging oneoftheDodola songs, andthehousewife
pours apailofwater over her.
Oneofthesongs they singruns thus—
"Wegothrough thevillage;
Theclouds gointhesky;
Wegofaster,
Faster gotheclouds;
They have overtaken us,
Andwetted thecornandthevine."
Asimilar custom isobserved bytheGreeks, Bul-
garians, andRoumanians.- Insuchcustoms the leaf-
dressed girlrepresents the spirit ofvegetation, and
drenching herwithwater isanimitation ofrain. In
Russia, intheGovernment ofKursk, when rain is
much wanted, thewomen seize apassing stranger and

incouples withanox-yoke ontheir shoulders, apriest

when theground isparched with drought, some girls
strip themselves naked, and, ledbyanolderwoman,
who isalsonaked, they steal aharrow andcarry it
across the field toabrook, where they set itafloat.

rain-charm isresorted toinIndia;nakedwomen drag

without it.

Awildmusic begins toplay;maddened bythedinof

Another wayofconstraining therain-god istodis-
turbhim inhishaunts. This seems thereason why
rain issupposed tobetheconsequence oftroubling a
sacred spring. TheDards believe that ifacowskin
oranything impure isplaced incertain springs, storms
willfollow.^ Gervasius mentions aspring intowhich
ifastone orastickwere thrown, rainwould atonce
issuefrom itanddrench thethrower." There wasa
fountain inMunster such that ifitwere touched or
even looked atbyahuman being, itwould atonce
flood thewhole province with rain.^ Sometimes an
appeal ismade tothepityofthegods. When their
corn isbeing burnt upbythesun,theZulus look out
fora"heaven-bird," kill it,andthrow itintoapool.
Then theheaven melts with tenderness forthedeath
ofthebird;"itwails for itbyraining, wailing a

Apeculiar mode ofmaking rainwasadopted bythe
heathen Arabs. They tiedtwo sorts ofbushes tothe
tailsandhind-legs oftheir cattle, and setting fireto
thebushes drove thecattle tothetopofamountain,
praying forrain." Thismay be,asWellhausen sug-

mode ofrain-making istoburnhuman hair.'-
Like other peoples theGreeks andRomans sought
toprocure rainbymagic, when prayers andprocessions^
hadproved ineffectual. Forexample, inArcadia,
when thecornand trees were parched with drought,
thepriest ofZeus dipped anoakbranch intoacertain
spring onMount Lycaeus. Thus troubled, thewater
sentupamisty cloud, fromwhich rainsoon fellupon
the land.*Asimilar mode ofmaking rain isstill
practised, aswehave seen, inHalmahera nearNew
Guinea. The people ofCrannon inThessaly hada
bronze chariot which theykept inatemple. When
they desired ashower theyshook thechariot andthe
shower fell.^ Probably therattling ofthechariot was
meant toimitate thunder ;wehave already seen that
inRussia mock thunder andlightning form part of

mademock thunder bydragging bronze kettles behind

There were Etruscan wizards whomade rain ordis-

They were thought tobring therainorthewater out

Again, primitive man fancies hecanmake thesun

They thought thatthedemon would notstaywhere he

andcoerced byhimintodoing hiswill. Atthisstage
ofthought theworld isviewed asagreat democracy
;
allbeings in it,whether natural orsupernatural, are
supposed tostand onafooting oftolerable equality.
Butwith thegrowth ofhisknowledge man learns to
realise more clearly thevastness ofnature and his
own littleness andfeebleness inpresence of it.The
recognition ofhisownhelplessness does not,however,
carry with itacorresponding belief intheimpotence
ofthose supernatural beings withwhich hisimagination
peoples theuniverse. Onthecontrary itenhances his
conception oftheir power. Fortheideaoftheworld

directing thecourse ofnature byhisown unaided
resources, that is,bymagic, andlooksmore andmore
tothegods asthesolerepositories ofthose supernatural
powers which heonce claimed toshare with them.

ground andsinks tothelevel ofablack art. Itisnow
regarded asanencroachment, atonce vainandimpious,
onthedomain ofthegods, andassuchencounters the
steady opposition ofthe priests, whose reputation and
influence gainorlosewiththose oftheir gods. Hence,
when atalateperiod thedistinction between religion
andsuperstition hasemerged, wefindthat sacrifice and
prayer aretheresource ofthepious andenlightened
portion ofthecommunity, while magic istherefuge of
thesuperstitious and ignorant. Butwhen, still later,
theconception oftheelemental forces aspersonal
agents isgiving way totherecognition ofnatural law;
then magic, based as itimplicitly isontheidea ofa
necessary and invariable sequence ofcause and effect,
independent ofpersonal will, reappears from the
obscurity anddiscredit intowhich ithad fallen, andby
investigating thecausal sequences innature, directly
prepares theway forscience. Alchemy leads upto
chemistry.
The notion ofaman-god orofahuman being
endowed with divine orsupernatural powers, belongs
essentially tothat earlier period ofreligious history in
which gods andmen are stillviewed asbeings of
much thesame order, andbefore they aredivided by
theimpassable gulfwhich, tolater thought, opens out
between them. Strange, therefore, asmayseem tous
theidea ofagod incarnate inhuman form, ithas
nothing very startling forearly man,who sees ina
man-god oragod-man onlyahigher degree ofthe
same supernatural powers which hearrogates in
perfect good faith tohimself Such incarnate gods
arecommon inrude society. The incarnation may
betemporary orpermanent. Intheformer case, the
incarnation—commonly known asinspiration orpos-

session—reveals itself insupernatural knowledge
rather than insupernatural power. Inother words,
itsusual manifestations aredivination andprophesy
rather than miracles. Ontheother hand, when the
incarnation isnotmerely temporary, when thedivine
spirit haspermanently taken up itsabode inahuman
body, thegod-man isusually expected tovindicate his
character byworking miracles. Only wehave to
remember thatbymen atthis stage ofthought
miracles arenotconsidered asbreaches ofnatural
law. Not conceiving theexistence ofnatural law,
primitive man cannot conceive abreach of it.A
miracle istohimmerely anunusually striking mani-
festation ofacommon power.
The belief intemporary incarnation orinspiration
isworld-wide. Certain persons aresupposed tobe
possessed from time totimebyaspirit ordeity;
while thepossession lasts, theirown personality lies
inabeyance, thepresence ofthe spirit isrevealed by
convulsive shiverings andshakings oftheman's whole
body, bywildgestures andexcited looks, allofwhich
arereferred, nottotheman himself, buttothespirit
which hasentered intohim;and inthisabnormal state
allhisutterances areaccepted asthevoice ofthegod
orspirit dwelling inhimandspeaking through him. In
Mangaia thepriests inwhom thegods tookuptheir
abode from time totimewere called "god-boxes" or,
forshortness, "gods." Before giving oracles asgods,
theydrank anintoxicating liquor, and inthefrenzy
thusproduced their wildwords were received asthe

particular modes ofproducing temporary inspiration,

andbecause weshall have occasion torefer tothem
later on.Oneofthesemodes ofproducing inspiration
isbysucking thefresh blood ofasacrificed victim. In
thetemple ofApollo Diradiotes atArgos, alambwas
sacrificed bynight once amonth;awoman, whohad
toobserve aruleofchastity, tasted theblood ofthe
lamb, and thus being inspired bythegod she
prophesied ordivined.^ AtAegira inAchaea the
priestess ofEarth drank thefresh blood ofabull
before shedescended intothecave toprophesy."* In
Southern India adevil-dancer "drinks theblood of

and loudly repeated byheraudience.^ SoApollo's
prophetess atethesacred laurel before sheprophesied.-
Itisworth observing thatmany peoples expect the
victim aswell asthepriest orprophet togive signs of
Inspiration byconvulsive movements ofthebody;and
iftheanimal remains obstinately steady, theyesteem
itunfit forsacrifice. Thuswhen theYakuts sacrifice
toanevil spirit, thebeast must bellow and rollabout,
which isconsidered atoken that the evil spirit has
entered into it.^ Apollo's prophetess could giveno
oracles unless thevictim tobesacrificed trembled in
every limbwhen thewinewaspoured on itshead.
But forordinary Greek sacrifices itwasenough that
thevictim should shake itshead;tomake itdoso,
water waspoured on it.^Many other peoples (Ton-
quinese, Hindoos, Chuwash, etc.)have adopted the
same testofasuitable victim;theypourwater orwine
onitshead;iftheanimal shakes itshead itisaccepted
forsacrifice;ifitdoes not, itisrejected.^
The person temporarily inspired isbelieved to
acquire, notmerely divine knowledge, but also, at
least occasionally, divine power. InCambodia, when

When found, theman istaken tothealtar ofthegod,
where themystery ofincarnation takes place. Then
theman becomes anobject ofveneration tohis
fellows, whoimplore him toprotect thevillage against
theplague.^ Theimage ofApollo atHylae inPhocis
wasbelieved toimpart superhuman strength. Sacred
men, inspired by it,leaped down precipices, toreup
huge trees bythe roots, and carried them ontheir
backs along thenarrowest defiles."^ The feats per-
formed byinspired dervishes belong tothesame class.
Thus farwehave seen that thesavage, failing to
discern the limits ofhis ability tocontrol nature,
ascribes tohimself andtoallmen certain powers which
weshould now callsupernatural. Further, wehave
seen thatoverandabove thisgeneral supernaturalism,
some persons aresupposed tobeinspired forshort
periods byadivine spirit, andthustemporarily toenjoy
theknowledge andpower oftheindwelling deity.
From beliefs likethese itisaneasy step tothecon-
viction thatcertain men arepermanently possessed by
adeity, orinsome other undefined way areendued
with sohigh adegree ofsupernatural powers astobe
ranked asgodsand toreceive thehomage ofprayer
and sacrifice. Sometimes thesehuman gods are re-
stricted topurely supernatural orspiritual functions.
Sometimes they exercise supreme political power in
addition. Inthelatter casethey arekings aswell as
gods, andthegovernment isatheocracy. Ishall give
examples ofboth.

posed towield asupernatural power over theelements;
theycould giveabundant harvests orsmite theground
with barrenness ;and they could inflict disease or
death. Human sacrifices were offered tothem toavert
their wrath. There were notmany ofthem, atthe
mostoneortwo ineach island. They lived inmystic
seclusion. Their powers were sometimes, butnot
always, hereditary. Amissionary hasdescribed oneof
these human gods from personal observation. The

andonthebeams ofthehouse andonthetrees round

entered theenclosure, except thepersons dedicated to
theservice ofthegod;onlyondayswhen human
victims were sacrificed might ordinary people penetrate
into theprecinct. Thishuman god received more
sacrifices than alltheother gods;often hewould siton
asortofscaffold infront ofhishouse and callfortwo
orthreehuman victims atatime. They were always
brought, fortheterror heinspired wasextreme. He
wasinvoked allover theisland, andofferings were sent
tohimfrom every side.^ Again, oftheSouth Sea
Islands ingeneral wearetold thateach island hada
manwhorepresented orpersonified thedivinity. Such
menwere called gods, and their substance wascon-
founded with that ofthedeity. Theman-god was
sometimes theking himself; oftener hewasapriest
orsubordinate chief- Tanatoa, King ofRaiatea, was
deified byacertain ceremony performed atthechief
temple. "As oneofthe divinities ofhissubjects,

therefore, thekingwasworshipped, consulted asan
oracle andhad sacrifices andprayers offered tohim."^
Thiswasnotanexceptional case. The kings ofthe
island regularly enjoyed divine honours, being deified
atthetimeoftheir accession.- Athisinauguration the
king ofTahiti received asacred girdle ofredand
yellow feathers, "which notonly raised him tothe
highest earthly station, but identified himwith their
gods."^ Thegods ofSamoa generally appeared in
animal form, butsometimes theywere permanently
incarnate inmen,whogave oracles, received offerings
(occasionally ofhuman flesh), healed thesick,answered
prayers, andsoon.^ Inregard totheoldreligion ofthe
Fijians, and especially oftheinhabitants ofSomo-

assume hisproper position inthe state. Generally
thisposition isadistinguished oneandconfers onhim
apowerful influence over thewhole community. In
some oftheislands thegod ispolitical sovereign of
theland ;andhence hisnew incarnation, however
humble hisorigin, israised tothesame high rank,and
rules, asgodand king, over alltheother chiefs.^ In

beenhonoured asitsimage atprevious festivals. The
portion ofthe sacrifice which had previously been
offered toheaven wasnowgiven totheslave,who ate
anddrank itinthename andstead ofheaven. Hence-
forth theslavewas well treated, kept forthefestivals

persons remarkable forgreat strength orvalour orfor

This Nikkal Senwasnoother than theredoubted

ofthepeople worship aspirit called Debce, towhom

WEATHER KINGS45
Waganda ofCentral Africa believe inagodofLake
Nyanza, whosometimes takes uphisabode inaman

thepeople, including thekingandthechiefs. He is
consulted asanoracle;byhisword hecan inflict or
heal sickness, withhold rain,andcause famine. Large
presents aremade himwhen hisadvice issought.^
Often theking himself issupposed tocontrol the
weather. Theking ofLoango ishonoured byhis
people "asthough hewere agod; andhe iscalled
Sambee andPango, which mean god. They believe
thathecan letthem have rainwhen helikes;and
once ayear, inDecember, which isthetimetheywant
rain, thepeople come tobegofhim togrant itto
them." On thisoccasion the kino; standing onhis
throne, shoots anarrow intothe air,which issupposed
tobring onrain." Much thesame issaidoftheking
ofMombaza.^ ThekingofQuiteva, inEastern Africa,
ranks withthedeity;"indeed, theCaffres acknowledge
noother gods than their monarch, and tohimthey
address those prayers which other nations arewont to
prefer toheaven. . . .Hence these unfortunate beings,
under thepersuasion that their king isadeity,
exhaust their utmost means and ruinthemselves in
gifts toobtain withmore facility what they need.
Thus, prostrate athisfeet,they implore ofhim,when
theweather long continues dry, tointercede with
heaven thattheymayhave rain;andwhen toomuch

iflongdrought orrain threatens tospoil thecrops,
they insult andbeathim tilltheweather changes.^
When theharvest fails orthesurfonthecoast istoo

and ifthecountry suffers inanyofthese respects the
Bodio isdeposed from hisoffice.^ SotheBurgundians

peoples havegone further and killed their kings in
times ofscarcity. Thus, inthetime oftheSwedish
kingDomalde amighty famine broke out,which lasted
several years, andcould bestayed bytheblood neither
ofbeasts norofmen. So,inagreat popular assembly
held atUpsala, thechiefs decided thatkingDomalde
himself was thecause ofthescarcity andmust be
sacrificed forgood seasons. Sothey slewhimand

hisdwelling, andburned him in it,"giving him to
Odin asasacrifice forgood crops."^In1814, a
pestilence having broken outamong thereindeer
oftheChukch, theShamans declared that the
beloved chiefKoch must besacrificed totheangry
gods;sothechiefs own sonstabbed him with a
dagger."- Onthecoral island ofNiue, orSavage
Island, intheSouth Pacific, there formerly reigned a
lineofkings. Butasthekings were alsohigh priests,
andweresupposed tomake thefood grow, thepeople
became angry withthem intimes ofscarcity andkilled
them;tillatlast, asone after another was killed, no
onewould beking,andthemonarchy came toanend.^
Asinthese cases thedivine kings, soinancient Egypt
thedivine beasts, were responsible forthecourse of
nature. When pestilence andother calamities had
fallen ontheland, inconsequence ofalongandsevere
drought, thepriests took thesacred animals secretly
bynight, andthreatened them, but iftheevildidnot
abate theyslew thebeasts.^
From thissurvey ofthereligious position occupied
bytheking inrude societies wemay infer that the
claim todivine andsupernatural powers putforward
bythemonarchs ofgreat historical empires likethose
ofEgypt, Mexico, and Peru, wasnotthesimple out-
come ofinflated vanity ortheempty expression ofa
grovelling adulation;itwasmerely asurvival and
extension oftheoldsavage apotheosis ofliving kings.

Thus, forexample, aschildren oftheSuntheIncas of

itamessenger sentfrom their father theSun tocallhis

usual words inwhich anIncaannounced hisapproach-
ingendwere these :"Myfather callsmetocome and
restwithhim." They would notoppose their father's
willbyoffering sacrifice forrecovery, butopenly
declared thathehad called them tohis rest.^ The
Mexican kings attheir accession tookanoath thatthey
would make thesun toshine, theclouds togive rain,

Chinese emperor bears theblame;forinextreme cases

sometimes castthatofthegods intotheshade. Thus
inthereign ofMerenra ahigh official declared that
hehad builtmany holy places inorder thatthespirits
ofthe king, theever-living Merenra, might bein-
voked "more than allthegods."^ TheKing of
Egypt seems tohave shared with thesacred animals
theblame ofany failure ofthe crops.^ Hewas
addressed as"Lord ofheaven, lordofearth, sun, life
ofthewhole world, lordoftime, measurer ofthesun's
course,Tum formen, lordofwell-being, creator ofthe
harvest, maker andfashioner ofmortals, bestower of
breath upon allmen, giver oflifetoallthehost of
gods, pillar ofheaven, threshold oftheearth, weigher

creaser ofthecorn"etc.^ Yet, asweshould expect,
theexalted powers thusascribed totheking differed
indegree rather than inkindfrom those which every
Egyptian claimed forhimself. Tiele observes that
"asevery goodman athisdeath became Osiris, as
every one indanger orneed could bytheuseofmagic
sentences assume theform ofadeity, itisquitecom-
prehensible how theking, notonly after death, but
already during his life,wasplaced onalevel with the

oftheWood atNemi, theSacrificial King atRome and
theKing Archon atAthens, occurs frequently outside
thelimits ofclassical antiquity and isacommon feature
ofsocieties atallstages from barbarism tocivilisation.
Further, itappears thattheroyal priest isoften aking
infactaswell asinname, swaying thesceptre aswell
asthecrosier. All thisconfirms thetradition ofthe
origin ofthetitular and priestly kings intherepublics
ofancient Greece and Italy. Atleast byshowing
thatthecombination ofspiritual andtemporal power,
ofwhich Graeco- Italian tradition preserved the
memory, hasactually existed inmany places, wehave
obviated any suspicion ofimprobability thatmight
have attached tothe tradition. Therefore wemay
now fairly ask.May nottheKing oftheWood have
hadanorigin like thatwhich aprobable tradition
assigns totheSacrificial King ofRome andtheKing
Archon ofAthens ?Inother words, may not his
predecessors inoffice havebeen alineofkingswhom
arepublican revolution stripped oftheir political power,
leaving them only their religious functions and the
shadow ofacrown ?There areatleast tworeasons
foranswering this question inthenegative. One
reason isdrawn from theabode ofthepriest ofNemi;
theother from his title, theKing oftheWood. If
hispredecessors hadbeen kings intheordinary
sense, hewould surely have been found residing, like
thefallen kings ofRome andAthens, inthecityof
which thesceptre hadpassed from him. This city
must have been Aricia, forthere wasnone nearer.
ButAricia, aswehave seen,wasthree miles offfrom
hisforest sanctuary bythelake shore. Ifhereigned,
itwasnotinthe city, but inthegreenwood. Again

his title,King oftheWood, hardly allows usto
suppose thathehadeverbeen aking inthecommon
sense oftheword. More likely hewasaking of
nature, andofaspecial side ofnature, namely, the
woods fromwhich hetook his title. Ifwecould find
instances ofwhatwemay calldepartmental kings of
nature, that isofpersons supposed toruleover
particular elements oraspects ofnature, theywould
probably present acloser analogy totheKing ofthe
Wood than thedivine kings wehave been hitherto
considering, whose control ofnature isgeneral rather
than special. Instances ofsuch departmental kings
arenotwanting.

Among tribes ontheoutskirts ofAbyssinia a

them. TheCambodian giftswere passed from tribe
totribe tillthey reached their destination ;forno
Cambodian would essay thelongandperilous journey.
The tribe amongst whom theKings ofFireand
Water reside istheChreais orJaray, arace with
European features butasallow complexion, inhabiting
the forest- cladmountains andhigh plateaux which
separate Cambodia from Annam. Their royal
functions areofapurely mystic orspiritual order;
they have nopolitical authority;they aresimple
peasants, living bythesweat oftheirbrow andthe
offerings ofthe faithful. According tooneaccount
they live inabsolute solitude, never meeting each other
and never seeing ahuman face. They inhabit
successively seven towers perched upon seven
mountains, andevery year they passfrom onetower
toanother. People come furtively and cast within
their reach what isneedful fortheir subsistence. The
kingship lasts seven years, thetime necessary to
inhabit allthetowers successively ;butmany die
before their time isout.The offices arehereditary
inoneor(according toothers) tworoyal families, who
enjoy high consideration, have revenues assigned to
them, andareexempt from thenecessity oftilling the
ground. Butnaturally thedignity isnotcoveted, and
when avacancy occurs, alleligible men(they must be
strong andhave children) fleeandhide themselves.

countenance thereport oftheir hermit-like seclusion

special gift oftheFire King, wemay conjecture
that the riceandsesame were thespecial gift of
theWater King. The latter wasdoubtless king of
rain aswell asofwater, andthe fruits oftheearth
were boons conferred byhimonmen. Intimes of
calamity, asduring plague, floods, and war, alittle
ofthissacred riceandsesame was scattered onthe

Inthe religious history oftheAryan race in
Europe theworship oftrees hasplayed anim-
portant part. Nothing could bemore natural. For
atthedawn ofhistory Europe wascovered with
immense primeval forests, inwhich the scattered
clearings must have appeared like islets inanocean
ofgreen. Down tothe first century before our

portion ofthe island. Westward itseems tohave

IIthecitizens ofLondon stillhunted thewild bull

58 TREE- WORSHIP chap,
theGermans theoldest sanctuaries were natural woods.^
However thismay be,tree-worship iswell attested
for allthegreat European families oftheAryan stock.
Amongst theCelts theoak-worship oftheDruids is
familiar toevery one.- Sacred groves werecommon
among theancient Germans, andtree-worship ishardly
extinct amongst their descendants atthepresent day.'^
AtUpsala, theoldreligious capital ofSweden, there
wasasacred grove inwhich every treewasregarded
asdivine/ Amongst theancient Prussians (aSlavon-
ianpeople) thecentral feature ofreligion was the
reverence forthesacred oaks, ofwhich thechief stood
atRomove, tended byahierarchy ofpriests whokept
upaperpetual fireofoak-wood intheholy grove.'^
The Lithuanians were notconverted toChristianity
tilltowards theclose ofthefourteenth century, and
amongst them atthedate oftheir conversion thewor-
shipoftreeswasprominent.*^ Proofs oftheprevalence
oftree-worship inancient Greece and Italy areabun-
dant' Nowhere, perhaps, intheancient world was
thisantique form ofreligion better preserved than in
theheart ofthegreat metropolis itself. IntheForum,
thebusy centre ofRoman life,thesacred fig-tree of
Romulus wasworshipped down tothedays ofthe
empire, andthewithering ofitstrunk wasenough to
spread consternation through thecity.^ Again, onthe

But itisnecessary toexamine insome detail the
notions onwhich tree-worship isbased. Tothesavage
theworld ingeneral isanimate, andtrees arenoexcep-
tion totherule.Hethinks thattheyhave souls like

Wanika inEastern Africa fancy thatevery treeand
especially every cocoa-nut tree has itsspirit; "the
destruction ofacocoa-nut tree isregarded asequi-
valent tomatricide, because that treegives them life
andnourishment, asamother doesherchild."' Siamese
monks, believing that there aresoulseverywhere and
that todestroy anything whatever isforcibly todis-
possess asoul, willnotbreak abranch ofatree"as
they willnotbreak thearmofaninnocent person."^
These monks, ofcourse, areBuddhists. ButBuddhist
animism isnotaphilosophical theory. Itissimply a
common savage dogma incorporated inthesystem of
anhistorical religion. Tosuppose with Benfey and
others thatthetheories ofanimism andtransmigration
current among rude peoples ofAsia arederived from
Buddhism istoreverse the facts. Buddhism inthis
respect borrowed from savagery, notsavagery from
Buddhism. Again, theDyaks ascribe souls totrees

inCongo place calabashes ofpalm-wine atthefootof

groom, andanother holding thesacred Tulsi {Ocym^tm

German peasants used totiefruit-trees together with
straw ropes tomake them bear fruit, saying that the
treeswere thus married.^

Sometimes itisthesouls ofthedead which are

South Australia regard asvery sacred certain trees,
which aresupposed tobetheir fathers transformed;
hence they willnotcutthetrees down, and protest
against thesettlers doing so."Some ofthePhilippine
Islanders believe thatthesouls oftheir forefathers are

onthespirits bycutting down trees tillthey find the

which tolodge, giveupthechild, and itisfound inthe

theychoose atreeofthesame kindandworship itby

The intention, perhaps, istoinduce the spirit ofthe

TheMundaris have sacred groves which were left

Sointheisland ofChedooba, onfelHng alarge tree,
oneofthewoodmen wasalways ready with agreen
sprig, which heranandplaced onthemiddle ofthe
stump the instant thetree fell/ For thesame
purpose German woodmen make across upon the
stump while thetree isfalling, inthebelief that this
enables the spirit ofthe tree toliveupon the
stump."
Thus thetree isregarded, sometimes asthebody,
sometimes asmerely thehouse ofthetree-spirit ;and
whenweread ofsacred treeswhich may notbecut

always possible tosaywith certainty inwhich way the

dwelling-place ofthespirits rather than astheir bodies.
The oldPrussians, itissaid, believed thatgods in-
habited high trees, such asoaks, fromwhich theygave
audible answers toinquirers;hence these treeswere
notfelled, butworshipped asthehomes ofdivinities.^
Thegreat oak atRomove wastheespecial dwelling-

hasbeenmade Inreligious thought. Animism is
passing intopolytheism. Inother words, instead of
regarding each tree asaliving andconscious being,
mannow sees in itmerely alifeless, inert mass,
tenanted foralonger orshorter timebyasupernatural
being who, ashecanpass freely from tree totree,
thereby enjoys acertain right ofpossession orlordship
over thetrees, and,ceasing tobeatree-soul, becomes
aforest god. Assoon asthetree-spirit isthus ina
measure disengaged from each particular tree, he
begins tochange hisshape andassume thebody of
aman, invirtue ofageneral tendency ofearly thought
toclothe allabstract spiritual beings inconcrete
human form. Hence inclassical artthesylvan deities
aredepicted inhuman shape, theirwoodland character
being denoted byabranch orsome equally obvious
symbol.^ But thischange ofshape does not affect
theessential character ofthetree-spirit. Thepowers
which heexercised asatree-soul incorporate inatree,
hestillcontinues towield asagodoftrees. This I
shallnowprove indetail. Ishall show, first, that
trees considered asayimate beings arecredited with
thepower ofmaking therain tofall,thesun toshine,
flocks andherds tomultiply, andwomen tobring
forth easily ;and, second, that theverysame powers
areattributed totree-gods conceived asanthropo-
morphic beings orasactually incarnate inliving men.
First, then, trees ortree -spirits are believed
togive rainand sunshine. When themissionary
Jerome ofPrague was persuading theheathen
Lithuanians tofell their sacred groves, amultitude

ofwomen besought thePrince ofLithuania tostop

ingthehouse ofgodfrom which they hadbeen
wont toget rainand sunshine/ The Mundaris
inAssam think ifatree inthesacred grove is
felled, thesylvan gods evince their displeasure by
withholding rain.^ InCambodia each village or
province has itssacred tree, theabode ofaspirit. If
therains are late, thepeople sacrifice tothe tree.^
Toextort rainfrom thetree-spirit abranch issome-
times dipped inwater, aswehave seenabove/ In
such cases the spirit isdoubtless supposed tobe
immanent inthebranch, andthewater thus applied
tothe spirit produces rainbyasortofsympathetic
magic, exactly aswesaw that inNew Caledonia the
rain-makers pour water onaskeleton, believing that
thesoul ofthedeceased willconvert thewater into
rain.' There ishardly room todoubt thatMannhardt
isright inexplaining asarain-charm theEuropean
custom ofdrenching with water thetrees which are
cutatcertain popular festivals, asmidsummer, Whit-
suntide, and harvest.*^
Again, tree -spirits make thecrops togrow.
Amongst theMundaris every village has itssacred
grove, and"thegrove deities areheld responsible for
thecrops, andareespecially honoured atallthegreat

trees were felled, allthe fruits oftheearth would
perish.^ Swedish peasants stick aleafy branch in
each furrow oftheir corn-fields, believing that this
willensure anabundant crop." Thesame ideacomes
outintheGerman andFrench custom oftheHarvest-
May. This isalarge branch orawhole tree,which
isdecked with earsofcorn, brought home onthe last
waggon from theharvest -field, andfastened onthe
roofofthefarmhouse orofthebarn, where itremains
forayear. Mannhardt hasproved that thisbranch
ortreeembodies the tree-spirit conceived asthespirit
ofvegetation ingeneral, whose vivifying and fructify-
inginfluence isthusbrought tobearupon thecorn
inparticular. Hence inSwabia theHarvest-May is
fastened amongst the last stalks ofcorn leftstanding
onthefield;inother places itisplanted onthecorn-
fieldandthe lastsheaf cut isfastened toitstrunk.^
The Harvest -May ofGermany has itscounterpart
intheeircsione ofancient Greece.'* The eiresione was
abranch ofolive orlaurel, bound about with ribbons
andhung with avariety offruits. This branch was
carried inprocession ataharvest festival andwas
fastened over thedoor ofthehouse, where itremained
forayear. The object ofpreserving theHarvest-
May ortheeiresione forayear isthat thelife-giving
virtue ofthebough may foster thegrowth ofthe
crops throughout theyear. Bytheendoftheyear
thevirtue ofthebough issupposed tobeexhausted
and itisreplaced byanew one. Following asimilar
train ofthought some oftheDyaks ofSarawak are

Customs likethat oftheHarvest- Mayappear to
exist inIndia and Africa. Ataharvest festival of
theLhoosai ofS.E.India thechief goes with his
people into the forest and fells alarge tree,which
isthen carried into thevillage and setupinthe

poured over the tree. Theceremony closes with
afeast and adance, atwhich theunmarried men
and girls aretheonly performers.^ Among the
Bechuanas thehack-thorn isvery sacred, and itwould
beaserious offence tocutabough from itandcarry
itintothevillage during therainy season. Butwhen

offertilising theseedbymeans ofthesacred cedar is
unmistakable. Inallthese cases thepower offoster-
ingthegrowth ofcrops, and, ingeneral, ofcultivated
plants, isascribed totrees. The ascription is"not
unnatural. For the tree isthe largest andmost
powerful member ofthevegetable kingdom, andman

Hence henaturally places thefeebler and, tohim,

How nobly doyoustand !youhave filledupmyhouse.

Here thedriving ofthegoats tothestone onwhich
thecedar hadbeen placed isclearly meant toimpart
tothem the fertilising influence ofthecedar. In
Europe theMay -tree (May -pole) issupposed to
possess similar powers over bothwomen and cattle.
Insome parts ofGermany onthe istofMay the
peasants setupMay-trees atthedoors ofstables and
byres, oneMay-tree foreach horse andcow;this is
thought tomake thecows yieldmuch milk." Camden
says ofthe Irish,"They fancy agreen bough ofa
tree, fastened onMay-day against thehouse, will
produce plenty ofmilk thatsummer."^

high tree,round which thepeople dance noisily. On
almost every dayoftheyear prayer and sacrifice are
offered tohimthathemay protect thecattle. Some-
times theimage ofMetsik ismade ofacorn-sheaf and
fastened toatall tree inthewood. The people
perform strange antics before ittoinduce Metsik to
guard thecornandthecattle.^
TheCircassians regard thepear-tree astheprotector
ofcattle. Sothey cutdown ayoung pear-tree inthe
forest, branch it,andcarry ithome, where itisadored
asadivinity. Almost every house hasonesuch pear-
tree. Inautumn, onthedayofthe festival, itis
carried into thehouse with great ceremony tothe
sound ofmusic andamid thejoyous cries ofallthe
inmates, whocompliment iton itsfortunate arrival.
Itiscovered with candles, andacheese isfastened to

Then they bid itgood-bye andtake itback tothe
courtyard, where itremains fortherestoftheyear, set
upagainst the wall, without receiving anymark of
respect."
Thecommon European custom ofplacing agreen
bush onMayDay before thehouse ofabeloved
maiden probably originated inthebelief ofthe fertil-
isingpower ofthe tree-spirit." Amongst theKara-
Kirgiz barren women rollthemselves ontheground
under asolitary apple-tree, inorder toobtain offspring.^

Lastly, thepower ofgranting towomen aneasy de-
livery atchild-birth isascribed totrees both inSweden
and Africa. Insome districts ofSweden there was
formerly abh'dtrad orguardian -tree (lime, ash, or
elm) intheneighbourhood ofevery farm. Noone
would pluck asingle leafofthesacred tree,anyinjury
towhich waspunished byill-luck orsickness. Preg-
nantwomen used toclasp thetree intheirarms in
order toensure aneasy- delivery.^ Insome negro
tribes oftheCongo region pregnant women make
themselves garments outofthebark ofacertain
sacred tree,because they believe that thistreedelivers
them from thedangers that attend child -bearing.-
The story thatLeto clasped apalm-tree andanolive-
tree ortwo laurel-trees when shewasabout togive
birth toApollo andArtemis perhaps points toa
similar Greek belief intheefficacy ofcertain trees to
facilitate delivery.^
From thisreview ofthebeneficent qualities com-
monly ascribed totree-spirits, itiseasy tounderstand
whycustoms like theMay-tree orMay-pole have
prevailed sowidely andfigured soprominently inthe
popular festivals ofEuropean peasants. Inspring or
earlysummer orevenonMidsummer Day, itwasand
still isinmany parts ofEurope thecustom togooutto
thewoods, cutdown atreeandbring itintothevillage,
where itissetupamid general rejoicings. Orthe
people cutbranches inthewoods, andfasten them on
every house. The intention ofthese customs isto
bring home tothe village, and toeach house, the
blessings which thetree-spirit hasinitspower tobestow.

Hence thecustom insome places ofplanting aMay-

evidence onthissubject afewexamples maybeselected.
SirHenry Piers, inhisDescription ofWestineath,
writing in1682 says: "On May-eve, every family
setsupbefore their door agreen bush, strewed over
withyellow flowers, which themeadows yield plentifully.
Incountries where timber isplentiful, they erect tall
slender trees, which stand high, andthey continue
almost thewhole year;soasastranger would gonigh
toimagine thattheywere allsigns ofale-sellers, and
that allhouses were ale-houses."^ InNorthampton-
shire ayoung tree *tenortwelve feethigh used tobe
planted before eachhouse onMayDaysoastoappear
growing.'-^ "An antient custom, stillretained bythe
Cornish, isthatofdecking their doors andporches on
the 1stofMay withgreen boughs ofsycamore and
hawthorn, andofplanting trees, orrather stumps of
trees, before their houses."'' Inthenorth ofEngland it
wasformerly thecustom foryoung people torisevery
early onthemorning ofthe istofMay,andgoout
with ifiusic intothewoods, where theybroke branches
andadorned them withnosegays andcrowns offlowers.
This done, theyreturned about sunrise andfastened
theflower-decked branches over thedoors andwindows
oftheir houses.^ AtAbingdon inBerkshire young
people formerly wentabout ingroups onMaymorning,
singing acarol ofwhich thefollowing aresome ofthe

they dress up inwoman's clothes, oradorn with
many-coloured shreds and ribbons. After thatcomes
afeast, attheendofwhich theytake thedressed -up
birch -tree, carry ithome totheir village with joyful
dance andsong, and set itupinoneofthehouses,
where itremains asanhonoured guest tillWhit-
sunday. Onthetwo intervening days they pay
visits tothehouse where their'guest 'is;butonthe
third day,Whitsunday, they takehertoastream and
flingherinto itswaters," throwing their garlands after
her.*'Allover Russia every village andevery town
isturned, alittle before Whitsunday, intoasort of
garden. Everywhere along the streets theyoung
birch-trees stand inrows, every house andevery room
isadorned with boughs, even theengines upon the
railway areforthetimedecked with green leaves."^
InthisRussian custom thedressing ofthebirch in
woman's clothes shows howclearly thetree isconceived
aspersonal ;andthethrowing itintoastream ismost
probably arain-charm. Insome village ofAltmark it
wasformerly thecustom forserving-men, grooms, and
cowherds togofrom farm tofarm atWhitsuntide
distributing crowns made ofbirch-branches andflowers
tothefarmers;these crowns werehung upinthe
houses and left tillthefollowing year."
Intheneighbourhood ofZabern inAlsace bands of
people goabout carrying May -trees. Amongst them
isaman dressed inawhite shirt, with hisface
blackened;infront ofhim iscarried alarge May-tree,

collects eggs, bacon, etc.^ Insome parts ofSweden on
theeveofMayDay ladsgoabout carrying each a
bunch offresh-gathered birch twigs, wholly orpartially
inleaf. With thevillage fiddler attheirhead theygo
fromhouse tohouse singing Maysongs;thepurport
ofwhich isaprayer forfine weather, aplentiful
harvest, andworldly and spiritual blessings. One of
them carries abasket inwhich hecollects gifts of
eggs andthe like. Ifthey arewell received they
stick aleafy twig intheroofover thecottage door.-
But inSweden midsummer istheseason when
these ceremonies arechiefly observed. OntheEve
ofSt.John (23d June) thehouses arethoroughly
cleansed and garnished with green boughs and
flowers. Young fir-trees areraised atthedoor-way
andelsewhere about thehomestead;andvery often
small umbrageous arbours areconstructed inthe
garden. InStockholm onthisdayaleaf-market is
held atwhich thousands ofMay-poles (^Maj Stdnger)
sixinches totwelve feet high, decorated with leaves,
flowers, slips ofcoloured paper, giltegg-shells, strung
onreeds, etc.areexposed forsale. Bonfires are lit
onthe hillsandthepeople dance round them and
jump over them. Butthechief event oftheday
issetting uptheMay-pole. This consists ofastraight
and tallspruce -pine tree, stripped ofitsbranches.
"Attimes hoops and atothers pieces ofwood, placed
crosswise, areattached to itatIntervals;whilst at
others itisprovided with bows, representing soto
say, aman with hisarms akimbo. From top to
bottom notonly the'MajStang '(May-pole) itself,
butthehoops, bows, etc.areornamented with leaves,

flowers, slips ofvarious cloth, gilt egg-shells, etc.
;
andonthetopofitisalarge vane, or itmaybea
flag." The raising oftheMay-pole, thedecoration
ofwhich isdone bythevillage maidens, isanaffair
ofmuch ceremony;thepeople flock to itfrom all
quarters anddance round itinagreat ring.^In
some parts ofBohemia alsoaMay-pole ormidsummer-
tree iserected onSt.John's Eve. The lads fetch a
tall firorpinefrom thewood and set itupona
height, where thegirlsdeck itwith nosegays, garlands,
andredribbons. Then they pilebrushwood, dry
wood, andother combustible materials about the tree,
and,when darkness has fallen, setthewhole on fire.
While the firewasburning theladsused toclimb
upthetreeand fetchdown thegarlands andribbons
which the girlshadfastened to it ;but asthis led
toaccidents, thecustom hasbeen forbidden. Some-
times theyoung people fling burning besoms intothe
air,orrunshouting down hillwith them. When the
tree isconsumed, theyoung menandtheir sweethearts
stand onopposite sides ofthe fire,andlook ateach
other through garlands andthrough the fire,' tosee
whether they willbetruelovers and willwed. Then
theythrow thegarlands thrice across thesmouldering
firetoeach other. When theblaze hasdieddown,
the couples joinhands and leap thrice across the
glowing embers. The singed garlands aretaken
home, andkept carefully inthehouse throughout
theyear. Whenever athunder-storm bursts, part of
thegarlands areburned onthehearth;andwhen
thecattle aresick orarecalving, they getaportion

ontheroof ofthehouse, tokeep house and field
frombadweather and injury.^
Itishardly necessary toillustrate thecustom of
setting upavillage May-tree orMay-pole onMay
Day. One point only—therenewal ofthevillage
May-tree—requires tobenoticed. InEngland the
village May-pole seems asarule, atleast inlater
times, tohave been permanent, notrenewed from
year toyear.-Sometimes, however, itwasrenewed
annually. Thus, Borlase saysoftheCornish people :
"From towns theymake incursions, onMay-eve,
into the country, cutdown atall elm, bring it
into thetown with rejoicings, and having fitted
astraight taper pole totheendof it,andpainted it,
erect itinthemost public part,andupon holidays
and festivals dress itwith garlands offlowers or
ensigns andstreamers."^ Anannual renewal seems
also tobeimplied inthe description byStubbs, a
Puritanical writer, ofthecustom ofdrawing home
theMay-pole bytwenty orforty yoke ofoxen.^
Insome parts ofGermany andAustria theMay-
tree orWhitsuntide- tree isrenewed annually, a
fresh treebeing felled andset up."^
Wecanhardly doubt that originally thepractice
everywhere wastosetupanewMay-tree every year.
Astheobject ofthecustom was tobring inthe
fructifying spirit ofvegetation, newly awakened in
spring, theendwould have been defeated if,instead
ofaliving tree,green andsappy, anoldwithered one
hadbeen erected year after year orallowed tostand
permanently. When, however, themeaning ofthe

custom hadbeen forgotten, andtheMay -treewas re-
garded simply asacentre forhoHday merrymaking,
people sawnoreason forfelling afresh tree every
year, andpreferred toletthesame treestand per-
manently, onlydecking itwith fresh flowers onMay
Day. Butevenwhen theMay-pole hadthusbecome a
fixture, theneed ofgiving ittheappearance ofbeing a
green tree,notadead pole,wassometimes felt.Thus
atWeverham inCheshire "aretwoMay-poles, which
aredecorated onthisday(May Day) with alldue
attention tothe ancient solemnity;the sides are
hung with garlands, andthetopterminated byabirch
orother tallslender treewith itsleaves on;thebark
being peeled, andthestem spliced tothepole, soas
togive theappearance ofonetreefrom thesummit."^
Thus therenewal oftheMay-tree isliketherenewal
oftheHarvest -May; each isintended tosecure a
fresh portion ofthe fertilising spirit ofvegetation,
andtopreserve itthroughout theyear. Butwhereas
the efficacy oftheHarvest -May isrestricted to
promoting thegrowth ofthecrops, thatoftheMay-
tree orMay-branch extends also, aswehave seen,
towomen and cattle. Lastly, itisworth noting that
theoldMay -tree issometimes burned attheend
oftheyear. Thus inthe district ofPrague young
people break pieces offthepublic May -tree and
place them behind theholy pictures intheir rooms,
where theyremain tillnextMayDay, andarethen

burned attheendoftheyear.^
Somuch forthetree-spirit conceived asincorpor-
ateorimmanent inthe tree.Wehavenow toshow
thatthetree-spirit isoften conceived andrepresented
asdetached from thetreeandclothed inhuman form,
andeven asembodied inhving men orwomen. The
evidence forthisanthropomorphic representation of
thetree-spirit islargely tobefound inthepopular
customs ofEuropean peasantry.
There isaninstructive class ofcases inwhich the
tree-spirit isrepresented simultaneously invegetable
formand inhuman form, which aresetsidebysideas
iffortheexpress purpose ofexplaining each other.
Inthese cases thehuman representative ofthetree-
spirit issometimes adollorpuppet, sometimes aliving
person;butwhether apuppet oraperson, itisplaced
beside atreeorbough;sothattogether theperson or
puppet, andthetreeorbough, form asortofbilingual
inscription, theonebeing, sotospeak, atranslation of
theother. Here, therefore, there isnoroom leftfor
doubt thatthespirit ofthetree isactually represented
inhuman form. Thus inBohemia, onthefourth
Sunday inLent,young people throw apuppet called
Death into thewater ;then the girlsgointo the
wood, cutdown ayoung tree,andfasten toitapuppet
dressed inwhite clothes tolook likeawoman;with
this treeandpuppet theygofrom house tohouse
collecting gratuities and singing songs with the
refrain—
"Wecarry Death outoftheviUage,

Here, asweshall seelater on,the"Summer" isthe
spirit ofvegetation returning orreviving inspring.
Insome places inthiscountry children goabout
asking forpence withsome small imitations ofMay-
poles, andwith afinely dressed dollwhich they call
theLady oftheMay/ Inthese cases thetreeand
thepuppet areobviously regarded asequivalent.
AtThann, inAlsace, agirlcalled the LittleMay
Rose, dressed inwhite, carries asmallMay -tree,
which isgaywith garlands and ribbons. Hercom-

Letuslook atyouround andround !

Inthecourse ofthesong awish isexpressed that
thosewho givenothing may lose their fowls bythe
marten, that their vinemaybearnoclusters, their tree
nonuts, their fieldnocorn;theproduce oftheyear is
supposed todepend onthegifts ofiered totheseMay

where children goabout with green boughs onMay
Daysinging andcollecting money, themeaning isthat
with the spirit ofvegetation they bring plenty and
good luck tothehouse, andthey expect tobepaid
fortheservice. InRussian Lithuania, onthe istof

Anexample ofthedouble representation ofthe

doubtless, liketheducking oftheGreen George in

often represented bothbytheMay-tree and inaddi-
tionbyamandressed ingreen leaves orflowers orby
agirlsimilarly adorned. Itisthesame spirit which
animates thetreeand isactive intheinferior plants
andwhich wehave recognised intheMay-tree and
theHarvest- May. Quite consistently thespirit isalso
supposed tomanifest hispresence inthe first flower
ofspring andreveals himself both inagirlrepresent-
ingaMay-rose, and also, asgiver ofharvest, inthe
person oftheWalber. The procession with this
representative ofthedivinity wassupposed toproduce
thesame beneficial effects onthefowls, the fruit-trees,
andthecrops asthepresence ofthedeity himself. In
other words, themummer wasregarded notasan
image butasanactual representative ofthespirit of
vegetation;hence thewishexpressed bytheattendants
ontheMay-rose and theMay-tree that thosewho
refuse them gifts ofeggs, bacon, etc.mayhavenoshare
intheblessings which itisinthepower oftheitinerant
spirit tobestow. Wemayconclude thatthese begging
processions withMay-trees orMay-boughs fromdoor

todoor("bringing theMay orthesummer") hadevery-
where originally aserious and,sotospeak, sacramental
significance;people really believed that thegod of
growth waspresent unseen inthebough;bythepro-
cession hewasbrought toeach house tobestow his
blessing. Thenames May, Father May,MayLady,
Queen oftheMay,bywhich theanthropomorphic spirit
ofvegetation isoften denoted, show that theconcep-
tionofthespirit ofvegetation isblent with apersoni-
fication oftheseason atwhich hispowers aremost
strikingly manifested."^
Thus farwehave seen that thetree-spirit orthe
spirit ofvegetation ingeneral isrepresented either in
vegetable form alone, asbyatree,bough, orflower; or
invegetable andhuman form simultaneously, asbya
tree,bough, orflower incombination with apuppet or
aliving person. Itremains toshow thattherepresen-
tation ofhimbyatree,bough, orflower issometimes
entirely dropped, while therepresentation ofhimbya
living person remains. Inthiscasetherepresentative
character oftheperson isgenerally marked bydress-
inghimorherinleaves orflowers;sometimes too it
isindicated bythename heorshebears.
Wesawthat inRussia atWhitsuntide abirch-tree
isdressed inwoman's clothes and setupinthehouse.
Clearly equivalent tothis isthecustom observed on
Whit-Monday byRussian girls inthedistrict ofPinsk.
They choose the prettiest oftheir number, envelop
herinamass offoliage taken from thebirch-trees and
maples, andcarry herabout through thevillage. Ina
district ofLittle Russia they takeround a"poplar,"
represented byagirlwearing bright flowers inherhair.^

LITTLE LEAFMAN

May eight ortenboys unite, clothe oneoftheirnumber
inleaves, andgofrom house tohouse begging.^
AtWhitsuntide inHolland poorwomen used togo
about begging with alittle girl called Whitsuntide
Flower [Pinxterbloem, perhaps akind ofiris);shewas
decked with flowers and satinawaggon. InNorth
Brabant shewears theflowers from which shetakes
hername andasong issung—
"Whitsuntide Flower
Turn yourself once round."-
InRuhla (Thliringen) assoon asthetrees begin
togrow green inspring, thechildren assemble ona
Sunday andgooutintothewoods, where theychoose
oneoftheir playmates tobetheLittle LeafMan.
They break branches from thetreesandtwine them
about thechild tillonly hisshoes peep outfrom the
leafy mantle. Holes aremade initforhim tosee
through, andtwoofthechildren lead theLittle Leaf
Man thathemay notstumble or fall. Singing and
dancing they takehimfrom house tohouse, asking
forgifts offood (eggs, cream, sausage, cakes). Lastly
they sprinkle theLeafMan withwater and feast on
thefood theyhave collected.^ InEngland thebest-
known example ofthese leaf-cladmummers isthe
Jack-in-the-Green, achimney-sweeper who walks
encased inapyramidal -shaped framework ofwicker-
work, which iscovered with holly and ivy,and

soon asthetrees begin tobud,aspot ischosen inthe

Often the leaf-clad person who represents the
spirit ofvegetation isknown astheking orthe
queen;thus, forexample, heorshe iscalled theMay
King, Whitsuntide King, Queen ofMay, andsoon.
These titles, asMannhardt observes, imply that the
spirit incorporate invegetation isaruler, whose
creative power extends farandwide.^

"blackcow inthe stallmilking white milk, black hen

Afterwards thedisguises ofbark arestripped offand

criticised atthearbour, afrog issecretly pinched and
poked bythecrier till itquacks. Sentence ofdeath
ispassed onthefrogbytheking;thehangman
beheads itand flings thebleeding bodyamong the
spectators. Lastly, theking isdriven from thehut
andpursued bythe soldiers.^ The pinching and
beheading ofthefrog aredoubtless, asMannhardt
observes,^ arain-charm. Wehave seen^ thatsome
Indians oftheOrinoco beat frogs fortheexpress
purpose ofproducing rain,and that killing afrog is
aGerman rain-charm.
Often the spirit ofvegetation inspring isrepre-
sented byaqueen instead ofaking. Inthe
neighbourhood ofLibchowic (Bohemia), onthefourth
Sunday inLent, girls dressed inwhite andwearing
the firstspring flowers, asviolets and daisies,- intheir
hair, leadabout thevillage agirlwho iscalled the
Queen and iscrowned with flowers. Durino- the
procession, which isconducted with great solemnity,
none ofthegirlsmaystand still,butmustkeep whirling
round continually and singing. Inevery house the
Queen announces thearrival ofspring andwishes the
inmates good luck and blessings, forwhich she
receives presents.^ InGerman Hungary the girls
choose theprettiest girltobetheirWhitsuntide Queen,
fasten atowering wreath onherbrow, andcarry her
singing through the streets. Atevery house they
stop, sing oldballads, andreceive presents.^ Inthe

south-east ofIreland onMayDay theprettiest girl
used tobechosen Queen ofthe district fortwelve
months. Shewascrowned withwildflowers;feasting,
dancing, and rustic sports followed, andwere closed by
agrand procession intheevening. During heryear
ofoffice shepresided over rural gatherings ofyoung
people atdances andmerrymakings. Ifshemarried
before nextMayDay herauthority was atanend,
buthersuccessor wasnotelected tillthatdaycame

familiar inEngland.
Again the spirit ofvegetation issometimes
represented byakingandqueen, alordand lady, or
abridegroom andbride. Here again theparallelism
holds between theanthropomorphic andthevegetable
representation ofthetree -spirit, forwehave seen
above that trees aresometimes married toeach other.^

isaRussian custom observed inthe district of
Nerechta ontheThursday before Whitsunday. The

round astately birch, twist itslower branches intoa
wreath, and kisseach other inpairs through the

forward, andmimicking adrunken man, flings herself

fastasleep. Another girlwakens thepretended sleeper
and kisses him;then thewhole bevy trips singing
through thewood totwine garlands, which theythrow

probably represents the revival ofvegetation in
spring. But itisnoteasy toassign their respective

roles totheforsaken bridegroom and tothe girl
whowakes himfrom hisslumber. Isthesleeper
the leafless forest orthebare earth ofwinter ?Is
the girlwhowakens him thefresh verdure orthe
genial sunshine ofspring? Itishardly possible, on
theevidence before us,toanswer these questions.
TheOraons ofBengal, itmay beremembered,
celebrate themarriage ofearth inthespringtime,
when the sal-tree isinblossom. Butfrom thiswe
canhardly argue that intheEuropean ceremonies
thesleeping bridegroom is"the dreaming earth"
andthegirlthespring blossoms.
Inthe Highlands ofScotland the revival of
vegetation inspring used tobegraphically re-
presented asfollows. OnCandlemas day(2dFeb-
ruary) intheHebrides "the mistress andservants of
each family take asheaf ofoats, anddress itupin
women's apparel, put itinalarge basket, and lay
awooden clubby it,and thisthey call Briid's bed;
andthen themistress and servants crythree times,
Brlid iscome, Briid iswelcome. This theydojust
before going tobed,andwhen they rise inthe
morning they lookamong theashes, expecting to
seetheimpression ofBriid's club there ;which if
theydotheyreckon itatruepresage ofagood crop
andprosperous year, and thecontrary they take as
an illomen."^ Thesame custom isdescribed by
another witness thus :"Upon the night before
Candlemas itisusual tomake abedwith cornand
hay,overwhich some blankets are laid, inapart of
thehouse near thedoor. When itisready, aperson
goes outand repeats three times, . . .'Bridget,

candles areleftburning near itallnight."^
Often themarriage ofthe spirit ofvegetation in
spring, though notdirectly represented, isimplied by
naming thehuman representative ofthe spirit "the
Bride," and dressing her inwedding attire. Thus
insome villages ofAltmark atWhitsuntide, while
theboysgoabout carrying aMay-tree orleading a
boyenveloped inleaves and flowers, the girls lead
about theMay Bride, agirldressed asabride with
agreat nosegay inher hair. They gofrom house
tohouse, theMay Bride singing asong inwhich
sheasks forapresent, and tells theinmates ofeach
house that ifthey give hersomething they will
themselves have something thewhole year through
;
but ifthey give hernothing they willthemselves
have nothing.^ Insome parts ofWestphalia two
girls lead aflower-crowned girl called "theWhitsun-
tide Bride "from door todoor, singing asong in
which they ask foreggs.^ InBresse inthemonth

I ANCIENT TREE-WORSHIP99
inthecustoms ofourEuropean peasantry. From
theremarkable persistence and similarity ofsuch
customs allover Europe wearejustified incon-
cluding that tree-worship wasonce animportant
element inthe religion oftheAryan race in
Europe, and that the rites andceremonies ofthe
worship were marked bygreat uniformity every-
where, and didnot substantially differ from those
which are still orwere tilllately observed byour
peasants attheir spring andmidsummer festivals.
For these rites bear internal marks ofgreat
antiquity, and this internal evidence isconfirmed by
theresemblance which the ritesbear tothose ofrude
peoples elsewhere.^ Therefore itishardly rash to
infer, from thisconsensus ofpopular customs, that
theGreeks andRomans, like theother Aryan
peoples ofEurope, once practised forms oftree-
worship similar tothose which are stillkept upby
our peasantry. Inthepalmy days ofancient
civilisation, nodoubt, theworship hadsunk tothe
level ofvulgar superstition and rustic merrymaking,
as ithasdone among ourselves. Weneed not
therefore besurprised that the traces ofsuch
popular rites arefewand slight inancient literature.
They are not less sointhe polite literature of
modern Europe;andthenegative argument cannot
beallowed togoformore intheonecase than in
theother. Enough, however, ofpositive evidence
remains toconfirm thepresumption drawn from
analogy. Much ofthisevidence hasbeen collected
andanalysed with hisusual learning andjudgment
byW.Mannhardt.- Here Ishall content myself
with citing certain Greek festivals which seem tobe
1Above, pp.69sqq., 85. 2Seeespecially hisAntike Wald-und Feldkulte.


THEDAEDALA
the classical equivalents ofanEnglish MayDay in
theolden time.
Every fewyears theBoeotians ofPlataea held a
festival which they called theLittle Daedala. Onthe
dayofthefestival theywent outintoanancient oak
forest, thetrees ofwhich were ofgigantic girth. Here
they setsome boiled meatontheground, andwatched
thebirds thatgathered round it.When araven was
observed tocarry offapiece ofthemeatand settle on
anoak,thepeople followed itandcutdown thetree.
With thewood ofthetreetheymade anImage, dressed
itasabride, andplaced itonabullock -cart with a
bridesmaid beside it. Itseems then tohave been
drawn tothebanks oftheriverAsopus andback
tothetown, attended byapiping anddancing crowd.
After the festival theimage wasputaway andkept
tillthecelebration oftheGreat Daedala, which fell
onlyonce insixty years. Onthisgreat occasion all
theimages thathadaccumulated from thecelebrations
oftheLittle Daedala weredragged oncarts insolemn
procession totheriver Asopus, andthen tothetopof
Mount Cithaeron. Here analtarhadbeen constructed
ofsquare blocks ofwood fitted together and sur-
mounted byaheap ofbrushwood. Animals were
sacrificed bybeing burned onthe altar, andthealtar
itself, together with theimages, wereconsumed bythe
flames. The blaze,weare told, rose toaprodigious
height andwasseen formany miles. Toexplain the
origin ofthefestival itwassaidthatonceupon atime
Hera hadquarrelled withZeus and lefthim inhigh
dudgeon. TolureherbackZeus gave outthathe
wasabout tomarry thenymph Plataea, daughter of
theriver Asopus. Hecaused awooden image tobe
made, dressed andveiled asabride, andconveyed on

abullock-cart. Transported with rageandjealousy,
Hera flew tothe cart,andtearing offthe veilofthe
pretended bride, discovered thedeceit thathadbeen
practised onher. Her ragewasnowchanged to
laughter, andshebecame reconciled toherhusband
Zeus/
Theresemblance ofthis festival tosome ofthe
European spring andmidsummer festivals istolerably
close.Wehave seen that inRussia atWhitsuntide
thevillagers gooutinto thewood, fellabirch -tree,
dress itinwoman's clothes, andbring itback tothe
village withdance andsong. Onthethird day itis
thrown intothewater.^ Again, wehave seen that in
Bohemia onMidsummer Eve thevillage lads fella
tall firorpine-tree inthewood and set itupona
height, where itisadorned with garlands, nosegays,
and ribbons, andafterwards burnt. ^The reason for
burning thetree willappear afterwards;thecustom
itself isnotuncommon inmodern Europe. Insome
parts ofthePyrenees atalland slender tree iscut
down onMayDayandkept tillMidsummer Eve. It
isthen rolled tothetopofahill, setup,andburned.^
InAngouleme onSt.Peter's Day, 29th June, atall
leafy poplar issetupinthemarket-place andburned.^
InCornwall "therewasformerly agreat bonfire on
midsummer- eve;alargesummer polewas fixed in
thecentre, round which thefuelwasheaped up. It
hadalarge bush onthetopofit.""^InDublin on

MARRIAGE OF
Probably theBoeotian festival belonged tothesame
class ofrites. Itrepresented themarriage ofthe
powers ofvegetation inspring ormidsummer, just as
thesame event isrepresented inmodern Europe by
aKingandQueen oraLordandLady oftheMay. In
theBoeotian, asintheRussian, ceremony thetree
dressed asawoman represents theEnglish May-pole
andMay-queen inone. Allsuch ceremonies, itmust
beremembered, arenot,oratleastwere notoriginally,
mere spectacular ordramatic exhibitions. They are
magical charms designed toproduce theeffect which
they dramatically represent. Iftherevival ofvege-
tation inspring isrepresented bytheawakening ofa
sleeper, the representation isintended actually to

marriage ofthepowers ofvegetation isrepresented
byaKing andQueen ofMay, theidea isthat the

pathetic magic. Theevent which itisdesired tobring
about isrepresented dramatically, andthevery repre-
sentation isbelieved toeffect, oratleast tocontribute
to,theproduction ofthedesired event. Inthecase

andhersullen retirement mayperhaps without strain-
ingbeinterpreted asamythical expression forabad
season andthefailure ofthecrops. Thesame dis-
astrous effects were attributed totheanger andseclusion
ofDemeter after thelossofherdaughter Proserpine.^
Now theinstitution ofafestival isoften explained by
amythical story oftheoccurrence upon aparticular

myth told toaccount forthe historical origin ofthe
festival, wecanoften inferfrom itthe realintention
withwhich the festival was celebrated. If,therefore,
theorigin oftheDaedala wasexplained byastory of
afailure ofcrops andconsequent famine, wemay infer
thattherealobject ofthefestival wastoprevent the
occurrence ofsuch disasters ;and, ifIamright inmy
interpretation ofthefestival, theobject wassupposed
tobeeffected byadramatic representation ofthe

was dramatically represented atannual festivals in
various parts ofGreece,^ and itisatleast afaircon-
jecture thatthenature andintention ofthese ceremonies
were such as Ihave assigned tothePlataean festival
oftheDaedala;inother words, thatZeusandHera
atthese festivals were theGreek equivalents ofthe
LordandLady oftheMay. Homer's glowing picture
ofZeus andHera couched onfresh hyacinths and
crocuses,^ like Milton's description ofthedalliance
ofZephyr andAurora, "ashemet heronce a-

Stillmore confidently may thesame character be
vindicated fortheannual marriage atAthens ofthe

Therefore attheir annual marriage inspring hecan
hardly havebeenanything butaKing, andsheaQueen,
ofMay. Thewomen who attended theQueen atthe
marriage ceremony would correspond tothebridesmaids

Ariadne waked andwedded byDionysus, resembles so
closely the littledrama acted byFrench peasants ofthe
AlpsonMayDay*that, considering thecharacter of
Dionysus asagodofvegetation, wecanhardly help
regarding itasthedescription ofaspring ceremony
corresponding totheFrench one. Inpoint offactthe
marriage ofDionysus andAriadne isbelieved by
Preller tohave been acted every spring inCrete.^
His evidence, indeed, isinconclusive, buttheview
itself isprobable. IfIamright ininstituting the
comparison, thechief difference between theFrench
andtheGreek ceremonies musthavebeen that inthe
former thesleeper wastheforsaken bridegroom, inthe

folk-custom andfrom the facts ofancient ritual and
mythology, weare justified inconcluding that the
archaic forms oftree-worship disclosed bythespring
andmidsummer festivals ofourpeasants were practised
bytheGreeks andRomans inprehistoric times. Do
then these forms oftree-worship help toexplain the
priesthood ofAricia, thesubject ofourinquiry ? I
believe they do. Inthe first place theattributes of
Diana, thegoddess oftheArician grove, arethose of
atree-spirit orsylvan deity. Her sanctuaries were in
groves, indeed every grove washersanctuary,^ andshe
isoften associated with thewood-god Silvanus in
inscriptions.- Like atree-spirit, shehelped women in
travail, and inthisrespect herreputation appears to
have stood high attheArician grove, ifwemayjudge
from thevotive offerings found onthespot.^ Again,
shewas thepatroness ofwild animals;^just asin
Finland thewood-god Tapio wasbelieved tocare for
thewild creatures thatroamed thewood, theybeing
considered his catde.^ So, too, theSamogitians
deemed thebirds and beasts ofthewoods sacred,
doubtless because theywere under theprotection of
thegod ofthewood.^' Again, there areindications
thatdomestic catde were protected byDiana,' asthey
certainly were supposed tobebySilvanus.^ But
wehave seen that special influence over cattle is
ascribed towood-spirits;inFinland theherds enjoyed
theprotection ofthewood-gods both while theywere

Lastly, inthesacred spring which bubbled, andthe
perpetual firewhich seems tohave burned inthe
Arician grove,^ wemayperhaps detect traces ofother
attributes offorest gods, thepower, namely, tomake
therain tofallandthesuntoshine,'^This last attri-
bute perhaps explains why Virbius, thecompanion
deity ofDiana atNemi, wasbysome believed tobe
thesun/
Thus thecultoftheArician grove wasessentially
thatofatree-spirit orwood deity. Butourexamina-
tionofEuropean folk-custom demonstrated thatatree-
spirit isfrequently represented byaliving person, who
isregarded asanembodiment ofthe tree-spirit and
possessed ofitsfertilising powers;andourprevious
survey ofprimitive belief proved that thisconcep-
tion ofagodincarnate inaliving man iscommon
among rude races. Further wehave seen that the
living person who isbelieved toembody inhim-
selfthetree-spirit isoften called aking, inwhich
respect, again, hestrictly represents thetree -spirit.
For thesacred cedar oftheGilgit tribes iscalled,
aswehave seen, "the Dreadful King";" and
thechief forest god oftheFinns, byname Tapio,
represented asanoldmanwith abrown beard, ahigh
hatoffir-cones andacoatoftree-moss, wasstyled the
Wood King, Lord oftheWoodland, Golden King of
theWood.^ May notthen theKing oftheWood in

conclusion, which isconfirmed byhisrelation tothe
Golden Bough. For since theKing oftheWood
could onlybeassailed byhimwhohadplucked the
Golden Bough, his lifewas safefrom assault solong
asthebough orthetreeonwhich itgrew remained
uninjured. Inasense, therefore, his lifewasbound
upwith thatofthetree ;andthus tosome extent he
stood tothetree inthesame relation inwhich the
incorporate orimmanent tree-spirit stands to it.The
representation ofthetree-spirit bothbytheKing of
theWood andbytheGolden Bough (for itwillhardly
bedisputed thattheGolden Bough waslooked upon
asavery special manifestation ofthedivine lifeofthe
grove) need notsurprise us,sincewehave found that
thetree-spirit isnotunfrequently thus represented in
double, firstbyatree orabough, andsecond bya
living person.
Onthewhole then, ifweconsider hisdouble char-
acter askingand priest, hisrelation totheGolden
Bough, and the strictly woodland character ofthe
divinity ofthegrove, wemay provisionally assume
that theKing oftheWood, liketheMayKing and
hiscongeners ofNorthern Europe, wasdeemed a
living incarnation ofthetree-spirit. Assuchhewould

§I.—
Royal andpriestly taboos
Inthepreceding chapter wesaw that inearly
society theking orpriest isoften thought tobe
endowed with supernatural powers ortobeanincar-
nation ofadeity ;inconsequence ofwhich thecourse
ofnature issupposed tobemore orlessunder his
control, andhe isheld responsible forbadweather,
failure ofthecrops, and similar calamities. Thus far
itappears tobeassumed that theking's power over
nature, like that over hissubjects and slaves, is
exerted through definite acts ofwill ;andtherefore
ifdrought, famine, pestilence, orstorms arise, the
people attribute themisfortune tothenegligence or
guilt oftheir king, andpunish himaccordingly with
stripes andbonds, or, ifheremains obdurate, with
deposition anddeath. Sometimes, however, thecourse
ofnature, while regarded asdependent ontheking,
issupposed tobepartly independent ofhiswill. His
person isconsidered, ifwemayexpress itso,asthe

force radiate toallquarters oftheheaven;sothatany
motion ofhis—theturning ofhishead, the lifting of
hishand—instantaneously affects andmay seriously
disturb some part ofnature. He isthepoint of
support onwhich hangs thebalance oftheworld;
andtheslightest irregularity onhispartmay over-
throw thedelicate equipoise. The greatest caremust,
therefore, betaken bothbyandofhim;andhiswhole
life,down toitsminutest details, must besoregulated
thatnoactofhis,voluntary orinvoluntary, may dis-
arrange orupset theestablished order ofnature. Of
this class ofmonarchs theMikado orDairi, the
spiritual emperor ofJapan, isatypical example. He
isanincarnation ofthesungoddess, thedeitywho
rules theuniverse, gods andmen included;once a
year allthegods waitupon himandspend amonth
athiscourt. During thatmonth, thename ofwhich
means "without gods," noonefrequents thetemples,
forthey arebelieved tobedeserted.^
Thefollowing description oftheMikado's mode of
lifewaswritten about twohundred years ago :-—
"Even tothisdaytheprinces descended ofthis
family, more particularly thosewho sitonthethrone,
arelooked upon aspersons most holy inthemselves,
and asPopes bybirth. And, inorder topreserve

would bethought ridiculous andimpertinent. Itwill
notbeimproper togive afewinstances of it.He
thinks that itwould bevery prejudicial tohisdignity
andholiness totouch theground with hisfeet ;forthis
reason, when heintends togoanywhere, hemust
becarried thither onmen's shoulders. Much less will
they suffer thatheshould expose hissacred person to
theopen air,and thesun isnotthought worthy to
shine onhishead. There issuch aholiness ascribed
toalltheparts ofhisbody, thathedares tocutoff
neither hishair, norhisbeard, norhis nails. How-
ever, lestheshould grow too dirty, theymay clean
him inthenightwhen heisasleep;because, they say,
thatwhich istaken from hisbody atthattime hath
been stolen from him,and thatsuch atheft doth not
prejudice hisholiness ordignity. Inancient times, he
wasobliged tositonthethrone forsome hours every
morning, with theimperial crown onhishead, butto
sitaltogether likeastatue, without stirring either hands
orfeet,head oreyes, norindeed anypartofhisbody,
because, bythismeans, itwasthought thathecould
preserve peace and tranquillity inhisempire;for if,
unfortunately, heturned himself onone side orthe
other, orifhelooked agood while towards anypart
ofhisdominions, itwasapprehended thatwar, famine,
fire,orsome great misfortune wasnear athand to
desolate thecountry. But ithaving been afterwards
discovered thattheimperial crown was thepalladium
which byitsmobility could preserve peace inthe
empire, itwas thought expedient todeliver his
imperial person, consecrated only toidleness and
pleasures, from thisburthensome duty, andtherefore
thecrown isatpresent placed onthethrone forsome
hours every morning. His victuals must bedressed

dishes :both arevery clean and. neat, butmade only
ofcommon clay ;thatwithout anyconsiderable ex-
pense theymaybelaid aside, orbroken, after they
have served once. They aregenerally broke, forfear
they should come intothehands oflaymen, forthey
believe religiously that ifanylayman should presume
toeathisfood outofthese sacred dishes, itwould
swell andinflame hismouth and throat. The like ill
effect isdreaded from theDairi's sacred habits;for
they believe that ifalayman should wear them, with-
outtheEmperor's express leave orcommand, they
would occasion swellings andpains inallparts ofhis
body." Tothesame effect anearlier account ofthe
Mikado says:"Itwas considered asashameful
degradation forhimeven totouch theground with his
foot. Thesunandmoon were noteven permitted to
shine upon hishead. None ofthesuperfluities ofthe
bodywere ever taken from him, neither hishair, his
beard, norhisnailswere cut.Whatever heeatwas

ifnature may bedisturbed bythe slightest in-
voluntary actoftheking, itiseasy toconceive the
convulsion which hisdeath might occasion. The
death oftheChitome, aswehave seen,wasthought
toentail thedestruction oftheworld. Clearly, there-
fore, outofaregard fortheirown safety, which might
beimperilled byanyrash actoftheking, and still
morebyhisdeath, thepeople willexact oftheirking
orpriest astrict conformity tothose rules, the
observance ofwhich isnecessary forhisown pre-
servation, andconsequently forthepreservation of
hispeople and the world. The idea that early
kingdoms aredespotisms inwhich thepeople exist
only forthesovereign, iswholly inapplicable tothe
monarchies weareconsidering. Onthecontrary,
thesovereign inthem exists only forhissubjects;
hislife isonly valuable solong ashedischarges the
duties ofhisposition byordering thecourse ofnature
forhispeople's benefit. Sosoon ashefails todoso
the care, thedevotion, thereligious homage which
they had hitherto lavished onhim, cease and are
changed intohatred andcontempt;he isdismissed
ignominiously, andmaybethankful ifheescapes with
his life.Worshipped asagodbythem oneday,he
iskilled bythem asacriminal thenext. But inthis
changed behaviour ofthepeople there isnothing capri-
cious orinconsistent. Onthecontrary, their conduct
isentirely ofapiece. Iftheirking istheir god,heis
orshould bealso their preserver ;and ifhewillnot
preserve them, hemustmake room foranother who
will. Solong, however, asheanswers their expecta-
tions, there isnolimit tothecarewhich theytakeof

Aking ofthissort liveshedged inbyaceremonious

etiquette, anetwork ofprohibitions andobservances,
ofwhich the intention isnot tocontribute tohis
dignity, much lesstohiscomfort, buttorestrain him
from conduct which, bydisturbing theharmony of
nature, might involve himself, hispeople, andtheuni-
verse inonecommon catastrophe. Farfromadding to
hiscomfort, these observances, bytrammelling his
every act,annihilate hisfreedom andoften render the
very life,which itistheir object topreserve, aburden
andsorrow tohim.
Ofthesupernaturally endowed kings ofLoango

enjoined asimple diet;theonly flesh hemight eat

atRome furnish astriking example. Astheworship
ofVirbius atNemi wasconducted, aswehave seen,^
byaFlamen, whomay possibly have been theKing
oftheWood himself, andwhose mode oflifemayhave
resembled thatoftheRoman Flamen, these ruleshave
aspecial interest for us.They were such asthe

Theburdensome observances attached totheroyal
orpriestly office produced their natural effect. Either
men refused toaccept the office, which hence tended
tofallintoabeyance ;oraccepting it,theysank under
itsweight into spiritless creatures, cloistered recluses,
fromwhose nerveless fingers thereigns ofgovern-
ment slipped into the firmer grasp ofmenwho
were often content towield thereality ofsovereignty

separation ofthespiritual andtemporal powers, theold
royal house retaining their purely religious functions,
while thecivilgovernment passed intothehands ofa
younger andmore vigorous race.

Andhowdoeshethink itmaybeguarded against ?
Asthesavage commonly explains theprocesses of
inanimate nature bysupposing thatthey areproduced
byliving beings working inorbehind thephenomena,
soheexplains thephenomena oflife itself Ifan
animal livesandmoves, itcanonly be,hethinks, be-
cause there isalittle animal inside which moves it.
Ifaman livesandmoves, itcanonlybebecause he
hasalittleman insidewhomoves him. Theanimal

explained bythepresence ofthesoul, sotherepose
ofsleep ordeath isexplained by itsabsence ;sleep
ortrance being thetemporary, death being the
permanent absence ofthe soul. Hence ifdeath be
thepermanent absence ofthe soul, theway toguard
against itiseither toprevent thesoulfrom leaving
thebody, or, ifitdoes depart, tosecure that itshall
return. Theprecautions adopted bysavages tosecure
oneorother ofthese ends take theform ofprohibi-

toensure either thecontinued presence orthereturn

trated byexamples.
Addressing some Australian blacks, aEuropean
missionary said, "Iamnotone,asyouthink, buttwo."
Upon thisthey laughed. "You may laugh asmuch
asyou like," continued themissionary, "Itellyouthat
Iamtwo inone;thisgreat body thatyousee isone;
within that there isanother little onewhich isnot
visible. The great body dies,and isburied, butthe
littlebody fliesawaywhen thegreat one dies." To
thissome oftheblacks replied, "Yes, yes.Wealso
aretwo,wealsohave alittlebody within thebreast."
Onbeing asked where the littlebodywent after death,
some said itwent behind thebush, others said itwent
intothesea,andsome saidthey didnotknow.^ The
Hurons thought that thesoulhadahead andbody,
arms and legs;inshort, that itwasacomplete little
model ofthemanhimself^ TheEskimos believe that
"thesoul exhibits thesame shape asthebody it
belonq-s to,but isofamore subtle andethereal nature."^
Soexact istheresemblance ofthemannikin tothe
man, inother words, ofthesoul tothebody, that, as
there are fatbodies and thin bodies, sothere are fat
souls and thinsouls;^asthere areheavy bodies and
light bodies, long bodies andshort bodies, sothere are
heavy soulsandlight souls, long soulsandshort souls.
Thepeople ofNias (anisland tothew^est ofSumatra)

long orhowheavy asoulhewould like,andasoulof

The heaviest soul ever given outweighs about ten
grammes. Thelength ofaman's life isproportioned
tothelength ofhissoul;children who dieyoung had
short souls.^ Sometimes, however, asweshall see,the
human soul isconceived not inhuman but inanimal
form.
The soul iscommonly supposed toescape bythe
natural openings ofthebody, especially themouth and
nostrils. Hence inCelebes theysometimes fasten fish-
hooks toasickman's nose, navel, and feet, sothat if
hissoulshould trytoescape itmaybehooked and
held fast.' One ofthe"properties" ofaHaida
medicine-man isahollow bone, inwhich hebottles up
departing souls, andsorestores them totheir owners."
TheMarquesans used tohold themouth andnose of
adying man, inorder tokeephim inlife,byprevent-
inghissoulfrom escaping.^ When anyoneyawns
intheir presence theHindus always snap theirthumbs,
believing that this willhinder thesoulfrom issuing
through theopen mouth. ^The Itonamas inSouth
America sealuptheeyes, nose, andmouth ofadying

inside and outside thehouse, forfearoneofthem

allpersons present inthehouse, even themother
herself areobliged tokeep their mouths shut the

question was put,Why they didnothold their noses
also, lestthechild's soulshould getintooneofthem ?
theanswer was thatbreath being exhaled aswell as
inhaled through the nostrils, thesoulwould beex-
pelled before itcould have time tosettle down.^
Often thesoul iscon'ceived asabirdready totake
flight. This conception hasprobably lefttraces in
most languages,- and itlingers asametaphor inpoetry.

done very gradually, toallow the soul time to

murder tochange theappearance ofasleeper, as
bypainting hisface infantastic colours orgiving

Itmay quithim inhiswaking hours, andthen
sickness or(iftheabsence isprolonged) death will

explain sickness bysupposing that the patient's
soul isabsent, and either does notcare toreturn
to itsbody orcannot find theway back. To
secure thereturn ofthesoul itistherefore neces-
sary ontheonehand tomake itsbody as
attractive aspossible, andontheother hand to
show itthewayhome. Tomake thebody at-
tractive allthe sick man's best clothes andmost
valued possessions are placed beside him;he
iswashed, incensed, andmade ascomfortable as
possible;and allhisfriends march thrice round the
hut calling outthe sick man's name andcoaxing
hissoul toreturn. Tohelp thesoul tofind itsway
back acoloured cord isstretched from thepatient's
head tothedoor ofthe hut. The priest inhis
robes reads alistofthehorrors ofhelland the
dangers incurred bysouls which wilfully absent
themselves from their bodies. Then turning tothe
assembled friends and thepatient heasks, "Is it
come?" Allanswer Yes, andbowing tothe re-
turning soulthrow seed over the sickman. The
cord which guided thesoulback isthen rolled up
andplaced round thepatient's neck,whomustwear
itforseven days without taking itoff.Noone
may frighten orhurt him, lest hissoul, notyet
familiar with itsbody, should again take flight.^ In
anIndian story aking conveys hissoul intothedead
body ofaBrahman, andahunchback conveys hissoul
intothedeserted body oftheking. Thehunchback
isnowkingandtheking isaBrahman. However,

reanimates thedead body ofaking byconveying
hisown soul into it.Meantime theBrahman's
body hasbeen burnt, andhissoul isobliged toremain

The departure ofthesoul isnotalways volun-
tary. Itmaybeextracted from thebody against its

tietheir children with aspecial kind ofstring toa
particular part ofthehouse, incase the souls of
thechildren should leave their bodies andgointo

And after thecorpse hasbeen laid inthegrave, but

with abamboo split lengthwise inonehand anda

into thegrave, anddrawing the stick along the
groove ofthebamboo points out tohissoul that
inthisway itmay easily climb upoutofthegrave.
While theearth isbeing filled in,thebamboos are

death prevails inEngland, Scotland, andMadagascar.*
The SuniMohammedans ofBombay cover with a
cloth themirror intheroom ofadying mananddo
notremove ituntil thecorpse iscarried outforburial.
They alsocover thelooking-glasses intheirbedrooms
before retiring torestatnight.^ The reason why sick
people should notseethemselves inamirror, and
why themirror inasick-room istherefore covered up,*^
isalso plain;intime ofsickness, when the soul
might take flight soeasily, itisparticularly dangerous
toproject thesoul outofthebodybymeans ofthe
reflection inamirror. The rule istherefore precisely
parallel totheruleobserved bysome peoples ofnot
allowing sickpeople tosleep;^forinsleep thesoul
isprojected outofthebody, andthere isalways a
riskthat itmaynotreturn. "In theopinion ofthe

Aswithshadows and reflections, sowith portraits;
they areoften believed tocontain thesouloftheperson

loth tohave their likenesses taken;for iftheportrait

toexercise afatal influence over theoriginal of it.
Thus theCanelos Indians ofSouth America think that
their soul iscarried away intheir picture. Two of
them having beenphotographed were soalarmed that
theycame back nextdayonpurpose toask ifitwere
really true that their souls hadbeen taken away.''
When Mr.Joseph Thomson tried tophotograph some
oftheWa-teita inEastern Africa, theyimagined that
hewasamagician trying togetpossession oftheir souls,
and that ifhegot their Hkenesses they themselves

would soon die iftheir portrait was inthehands of

still lingers invarious parts ofEurope. Some old

Some people inRussia object tohaving their silhouettes

forthesafety ofhisown soul.Now inpoint offact
theHfeoftheearly kings isregulated, aswehave seen
and shall seemore fully presently, byavery exact
code ofrules. Maywenotthen conjecture thatthese
rules aretheverysafeguards which onapriori grounds
weexpect tofindadopted fortheprotection ofthe
king's life ?Anexamination oftherules themselves
confirms thisconjecture. Forfrom this itappears that
some oftherules observed bythekings areidentical
with those observed byprivate persons outofregard
forthesafety oftheir souls;andeven ofthose which
seem peculiar totheking, many, ifnot all,aremost
readily explained onthehypothesis that they are
nothing butsafeguards orlifeguards oftheking. I
willnowenumerate some ofthese royal rules or
taboos, offering oneach ofthem suchcomments and
explanations asmayserve tosettheoriginal intention
oftherule initsproper light.
Astheobject oftheroyal taboos istoisolate the
king from allsources ofdanger, their general effect
istocompel him tolive inastate ofseclusion,
more orlesscomplete, according tothenumber and
stringency ofthetaboos heobserves. Now ofall
sources ofdanger none aremore dreaded bythe
savage than magic and witchcraft, andhesuspects
allstrangers ofpractising these black arts.Toguard
against thebaneful influence exerted voluntarily or
involuntarily bystrangers istherefore anelementary
dictate ofsavage prudence. Hence before strangers
areallowed toenter adistrict, oratleast before they
arepermitted tomingle freely with thepeople ofthe
district, certain ceremonies areoften performed bythe
natives ofthecountry forthepurpose ofdisarming the
strangers oftheir magical powers, ofcounteracting the

baneful influence which isbeHeved toemanate from
them, orofdisinfecting, sotospeak, thetainted
atmosphere bywhich they aresupposed tobe
surrounded. Thus intheisland ofNanumea (South
Pacific) strangers from ships orfrom other islands
were notallowed tocommunicate with thepeople until
they all,orafew asrepresentatives ofthe rest,had
been taken toeach ofthefourtemples intheisland,
andprayers offered that thegodwould avert any
disease ortreachery which these strangers might have
brought with them. Meat offerings were also laid
upon thealtars, accompanied bysongs anddances in
honour ofthegod. While these ceremohies were
going on, allthepeople except thepriests and their
attendants kept outofsight.^Onreturning from an
attempted ascent ofthe great African mountain
Kilimanjaro, which isbelieved bytheneighbouring
tribes tobetenanted bydangerous demons, Mr.
Newandhisparty, assoon astheyreached theborder
oftheinhabited country, were disenchanted bythe
inhabitants, being sprinkled with "aprofessionally
prepared liquor, supposed topossess thepotency of
neutralising evil influences, andremoving the spell
ofwicked spirits."'Intheinterior ofYoruba (West
Africa) thesentinels atthegates oftowns often oblige
European travellers towait tillnightfall before they
admit them, thefearbeing that ifthestrangers were
admitted bydaythedevils would enter behind them.^

European traveller lestheshould make them ill,
warned their wives andchildren nottogonear him.
These who could not restrain their curiosity killed
fowls toappease theevil spirits andsmeared them-
selves with theblood. ^InLaos before astranger
canbeaccorded hospitality themaster ofthehouse
must offer sacrifice totheancestral spirits;otherwise
thespirits would beoffended andwould send disease
ontheinmates.^ IntheMentawej Islands when a
stranger enters ahouse where there arechildren, the
father orothermember ofthefamily takes theorna-
ment which thechildren wear intheir hairandhands
ittothestranger, who holds itinhishands fora
while andthen gives itback tohim. This isthought
toprotect thechildren from theevil effect which the
sight ofastranger might have upon them.^ At

concluded byleaping tothelevel ofCaptain Moresby's

several times,"asiftoshow thathehadconquered

North American Indians "have anidea thatstrangers,
particularly white strangers, areofttimes accompanied
byevil spirits. Ofthese they have great dread, as

plainbythecustom observed inAmboina andUHase
ofsprinkling sickpeople withpungent spices, such as
ginger andcloves, chewed fine, inorder bytheprickling
sensation todriveaway thedemon ofdisease which

intention some ofthenatives ofBorneo andCelebes
sprinkle riceupon thehead orbody ofaperson
supposed tobeinfested bydangerous spirits;afowl
isthen brought, which, bypicking upthericefrom the
person's head orbody, removes along with itthespirit

This isdone, forexample, topersons who have

theirhands scratched withaknife from the tipofthe

toefface allconnection between thethings andthe

thetraveller, before heenters avillage, isfrequently
received withasacrifice ofanimal lifeorfood, orof
fireandincense. Therecent Afghan Boundary Mission,
inpassing byvillages inAfghanistan, wasoftenmet
with fireand incense.^ Sometimes atray oflighted
embers isthrown under thehoofs ofthetraveller's horse,
withthewords, "You arewelcome."" Onentering a
village inCentral Africa Emin Pasha wasreceived
with the sacrifice oftwo goats ;their blood was
sprinkled onthepathandthechief stepped over the
blood togreet Emin.^ Amongst theEskimos of
Cumberland Inlet, when astranger arrives atan
encampment, thesorcerer goes outtomeet him. The
stranger folds hisarms and inclines hishead toone
side, soastoexpose hischeek, upon which the
sorcerer deals aterrible blow, sometimes felling him to
theground. Next thesorcerer inhisturn presents
hischeek and receives abuffet from thestranger.
Then they kisseach other, theceremony isover, and
thestranger ishospitably received by all.'^ Sometimes
thedread ofstrangers andtheir magic istoogreat to
allow oftheir reception onany terms. Thus when
Speke arrived atacertain village thenatives shut

persuasion could avail withthem, andtheparty hadto
proceed tothenext village."^
The fearthusentertained ofalien visiters isoften
mutual. Entering astrange land, thesavage feels
thathe istreading- enchanted orround, andhetakes
steps toguard against thedemons thathaunt itand
themagical artsofitsinhabitants. Thus ongoing to
astrange landtheMaoris performed certain ceremonies
tomake itnoa(common), lest itmight have been
previously tapu (sacred).^ When Baron Miklucho-
Maclay wasapproaching avillage ontheMaclay Coast
ofNew Guinea, oneofthenatives whoaccompanied
himbroke abranch from atreeandgoing aside
whispered to itforawhile;thengoing uptoeach
member oftheparty, oneafter another, hespatsome-
thing upon hisback andgave himsome blows with
thebranch. Lastly, hewent intotheforest andburied
thebranch under withered leaves inthethickest part
ofthejungle. Thisceremony wasbelieved toprotect
theparty against alltreachery anddanger inthe
village theywere approaching." The ideaprobably
wasthatthemalignant influences weredrawn offfrom
thepersons intothebranch andburied with itinthe
depths ofthe forest. InAustralia, when astrange
tribe hasbeen invited intoadistrict and isapproaching
theencampment ofthetribe which owns theland,
"thestrangers carry lighted bark orburning sticks in
their hands, forthepurpose, they say,ofclearing and
purifying theair."^ Sowhen twoGreek armies were

Again, itisthought thatamanwhohasbeenona

Bechuanas "cleanse orpurify themselves afterjourneys
byshaving their heads, etc., lestthey should have
contracted from strangers some evilbywitchcraft or
sorcery.'"^ Insome parts ofWestern Africa when a
man returns home after along absence, before heis
allowed tovisit hiswife,hemustwash hisperson with
aparticular fluid,andreceive from thesorcerer acer-
tainmark onhisforehead, inorder tocounteract any
magic spell which astranger woman mayhave cast
onhim inhisabsence, andwhich might becommuni-

considered tohave sopolluted themselves bycontact
with strangers thatnothing butbeing born again could
restore them topurity. "Forthepurpose ofregener-

When precautions likethese aretaken onbehalf

surprised tofind that special measures areadopted to
protect thekingfrom thesame insidious danger. In

reason assigned forthecustom was that the fire
purged away anymagic influence which thestrangers
might mean toexercise over theKhan.^ When
subject chiefs come with their retinues tovisit

intheCongo Basin) forthe firsttime orafterbeing
rebelHous, they have tobathe, men andwomen
together, intwobrooks ontwosuccessive days, pass-

After thesecond bath they proceed, entirely naked, to
thehouse ofKalamba, whomakes along white mark
onthebreast andforehead ofeach ofthem. Then
they return tothemarket-place and dress, afterwhich
theyundergo thepepper ordeal. Pepper isdropped
into theeyes ofeach ofthem, andwhile this isbeing
done thesufferer has tomake aconfession ofallhis
sins, toanswer allquestions thatmaybeputtohim,
andtotake certain vows. This ends theceremony,
and thestrangers arenow free totakeuptheir
quarters inthetown foraslong asthey choose to

betohinder evil influences from entering thebody

theformer rather than tothe latter motive isto
beascribed thecustom observed bysome African
sultans ofveiling their faces. The Sultan ofDarfur

Byanextension ofthelikeprecaution kings are
sometimes forbidden ever toleave their palaces;or, if
they areallowed todoso,their subjects areforbidden
toseethem abroad. Wehave seen that thepriestly
king atShark Point, West Africa, maynever quit his
house oreven hischair, inwhich heisobliged tosleep
sitting/ After hiscoronation theKing ofLoango is
confined tohispalace, which hemaynotleave.'^The
King ofIbo(West Africa) "does notstepoutofhis
house intothetown unless ahuman sacrifice ismade
topropitiate thegods :onthisaccount henever goes
outbeyond theprecincts ofhispremises."^Thekings
ofAethiopia wereworshipped asgods, butwere mostly
kept shutupintheir palaces."* The kings ofSabaea
(Sheba), thespice country ofArabia, were notallowed
togooutoftheir palaces ;ifthey did so,themob
stoned them todeath." But atthetopofthepalace
therewasawindow with achain attached to it. It
anymandeemed hehadsuffered wrong, hepulled the
chain, andtheking perceived himandcalled him in

highandcarefully kept inrepair, lined every street in

which thekingwas likely atanytime topass. Behind

thebanana falls illandsends tothedisease -maker,
offering him presents ifhewill stop burning the
banana skin." Hence noonemay touch thefood
which theKing ofLoango leaves upon hisplate;it
isburied inahole intheground. Andnoonemay
drink outofthe king's vessel.^ Similarly noman
maydrink outofthesame cuporglass with theKing

wasbelieved that ifanyone else atehisfood outof
these sacred dishes hismouth andthroat would be-
come swollen and inflamed. Thesame illeffect was
thought tobeexperienced byanyonewho should
wear theMikado's clothes without hisleave;hewould
have swellings andpains allover hisbody.^ Inthe
evil effects thussupposed tofollow upon theuseof
theMikado's vessels orclothes weseethatother side
ofthedivine king's orgod-man's character towhich
attention hasbeen already called. The divine person
isasource ofdanger aswell asofblessing ;hemust

Hissacred organism, sodelicate thatatouch may
disorder it,isalso electrically charged with apowerful
spiritual force which may discharge itself with fatal
effect onwhatever comes incontact with it.Hence
theisolation oftheman-god isquite asnecessary for
thesafety ofothers asforhisown. Hisdivinity isa
fire,which, under proper restraints, confers endless
blessings, but, ifrashly touched orallowed tobreak
bounds, burns and,destroys what ittouches.
Hence thedisastrous effects supposed toattend a
breach oftaboo;theoffender hasthrust hishand into
thedivine fire,which shrivels upandconsumes him

Stout, hungry fellow, coming upafter thechief had

hewasinformed byahorror-stricken spectator that

Nowonder therefore thatthesavage should rank
thesehuman divinities amongst what heregards asthe
dangerous classes, andshould impose exactly thesame
restraints upon theone asupon theother. For in-
stance, thosewhohave defiled themselves bytouching
adead body areregarded bytheMaoris asina

isolated. But thetaboos observed byandtowards
these defiled persons {e.g.theymay nottouch food
with their hands, andthevessels usedbythemmay
notbeused byother people) areidentical with those
observed byandtowards sacred chiefs."^ And, in

Thus the rules ofceremonial purity observed by
divine kings, chiefs, and priests, byhomicides, women
atchild-birth, andsoon,are insome respects alike.
Tousthese different classes ofpersons appear todiffer
totally incharacter andcondition; some ofthemwe
should callholy, others wemight pronounce unclean
and polluted. Butthesavage makes nosuch moral
distinction between them;theconceptions ofholiness
and pollution arenotyetdifferentiated inhismind.
Tohim thecommon feature ofallthese persons is
that they aredangerous and indanger, and the
danger inwhich they stand and towhich they
expose others iswhatweshould call spiritual or
supernatural, that is,imaginary. The danger,
however, isnot less realbecause itisimaginary;
imagination actsuponman asreally asdoes gravi-
tation, andmay killhim ascertainly asadose of
prussic acid.To seclude these persons from the
restoftheworld sothatthedreaded spiritual danger
shall neither reach them, norspread from them, is
theobject ofthetaboos which theyhave toobserve.

would notallow iron tobeused intheconstruction
ofbuildings within histerritory, believing that itsuse
would inevitably befollowed bysmall-pox andother

This superstitious objection toironperhaps dates
from that early time inthehistory ofsociety when

many with suspicion and dislike. Foreverything new

account forthesuperstitious aversion toiron enter-
tained bykings and priests and attributed bythem
tothegods;possibly thisaversion mayhave been
intensified inplaces bysome such accidental cause as
theseries ofbadseasons which cast discredit oniron
ploughshares inPoland. Butthedisfavour inwhich
iron isheldbythegodsandtheir ministers hasanother
side. Thevery factthat iron isdeemed obnoxious to
spirits furnishes men with aweapon which may be
turned against the spirits when occasion serves. As
their dislike ofiron issupposed tobesogreat that
they willnotapproach persons andthings protected
bytheobnoxious metal, ironmayobviously beemployed
asacharm forbanning ghosts andother dangerous
spirits. And itoften issoused. Thuswhen Scotch
fishermen were atsea,andone ofthem happened
totake thename ofGod invain, the firstmanwho
heard him called out "Cauld airn," atwhich every
man ofthecrew grasped thenearest bitofironand
held itbetween hishands forawhile.^ InMorocco
iron isconsidered agreat protection against demons
;
hence itisusual toplace aknife ordagger under

from such special circumstances theprohibition isalso

America, "through astrong principle ofreligion,
abstain inthestrictest manner from eating theblood
ofanyanimal, as itcontains the lifeand spirit ofthe
beast." These Indians "commonly pull their new-
killed venison (before they dress it)several times
through thesmoke andflame ofthe fire,bothbythe
wayofasacrifice and toconsume theblood, life,or
animal spirits ofthebeast, which withthem would be
amost horrid abomination toeat."^' Many ofthe
Slave, Hare, andDogrib Indians scruple totaste the
blood ofgame;hunters oftheformer tribes collect the
blood intheanimal's paunch andbury itinthesnow.^
Jewish hunters poured outtheblood ofthegame
theyhad killed andcovered itupwith dust. They
would nottaste theblood, believing that thesoulor
lifeoftheanimal was intheblood, oractually wasthe
blood. ^Thesame belief washeldbytheRomans,'^
and isshared bytheArabs,"^andbysome ofthe
Papuan tribes ofNew Guinea.^
Itisacommon rule that royal blood must notbe

devised bywhich theroyal blood shall notbespilt

the sufferer's neck isbroken with sandal-wood clubs

orsuffocate itinsmoke.^ The explanation ofthe
reluctance toshed blood ontheground isprobably to
befound inthebelief thatthesoul isintheblood, and
thattherefore anyground onwhich itmay fallneces-
sarily becomes taboo orsacred. InNew Zealand
anything upon which even adrop ofahigh chiefs
blood chances tofallbecomes taboo orsacred tohim.
For instance, aparty ofnatives having come tovisit
achief inafinenewcanoe, thechief gotinto it,butin
doing soasplinter entered his foot,andtheblood
trickled onthecanoe, which atoncebecame sacred to
him. Theowner jumped out,dragged thecanoe
ashore opposite thechiefs house, and left itthere.
Again, achief inentering amissionary's house knocked
hishead against abeam, andtheblood flowed. The
natives saidthat informer times thehouse would have
belonged tothe chief.' Asusually happens with
taboos ofuniversal application, theprohibition tospill
theblood ofatribesman ontheground applies
with peculiar stringency tochiefs and kings, and
isobserved intheir caselong after ithasceased to
beobserved inthecase ofothers.
Wehave seen that theFlamen Dialis wasnot
allowed towalk under atrellised vine.^ The reason
forthisprohibition wasperhaps asfollows. Ithasbeen
shown that plants areconsidered asanimate beings
which bleedwhen cut,theredjuice which exudes from
some plants being regarded astheblood oftheplant*
Thejuice ofthegrape istherefore naturally conceived
astheblood ofthevine.^ And since, aswehave just

seen, thesoul isoften believed tobeintheblood, the
juice ofthegrape isregarded asthe soul, oras
containing the soul, ofthe vine. This belief is
strengthened bythe intoxicating effects ofwine.
For, according toprimitive notions, allabnormal
mental states, such asintoxication ormadness, are
caused bytheentrance ofaspirit into theperson;
such mental states, inother words, areregarded as
forms ofpossession orinspiration. Wine, therefore,
isconsidered ontwo distinct grounds asaspirit or
containing aspirit ;firstbecause, asaredjuice, itis
identified with theblood ofthe plant, andsecond
because itintoxicates orinspires. Therefore ifthe
Flamen Dialis hadwalked under atrellised vine, the
spirit ofthevine,embodied intheclusters ofgrapes,
would havebeen immediately over hisheadandmight
have touched it,which foraperson likehim inastate
ofpermanent taboo^would havebeen highly danger-
ous. This interpretation oftheprohibition willbe
made probable ifwecanshow, first, thatwine has
been actually viewed bysome peoples asblood
and intoxication asinspiration produced bydrinking
theblood ;and, second, that itisoften considered
dangerous, especially fortabooed persons, tohave
either blood oraliving person over their heads.
With regard tothe first point,weareinformed by
Plutarch thatofoldtheEgyptian kings neither drank
wine noroffered itinlibations tothegods, because
they held ittobetheblood ofbeings whohadonce
fought against thegods, thevinehaving sprung from
their rotting bodies; andthefrenzy ofintoxication was
explained bythesupposition thatthedrunken manwas
1Dialis cotidie feriatus est,Aulus Gellius, x.15,16.

filled with theblood oftheenemies ofthegods/ The
Aztecs regarded pulqiie orthewine ofthecountry as
bad,onaccount ofthewilddeeds whichmen didunder
itsinfluence. Butthese wilddeeds were believed to
betheacts, notofthedrunken man, butofthewine-
godbywhom hewaspossessed andinspired;andso
seriously was thistheory ofinspiration held that ifany
onespoke illoforinsulted atipsyman,hewas liable
tobepunished fordisrespect tothewine-god incarnate
inhisvotary. Hence, saysSahagun, itwasbelieved,
notwithout ground, thattheIndians intoxicated them-
selves onpurpose tocommit with impunity crimes
forwhich theywould certainly have been punished if
theyhadcommitted them sober.'- Thus itappears
thatontheprimitive view intoxication ortheinspira-
tionproduced bywine isexactly parallel tothe in-
spiration produced bydrinking theblood ofanimals.^
The soulorlife isintheblood, andwine istheblood
ofthevine. Hence whoever drinks theblood ofan
animal isinspired with thesouloftheanimal orofthe
god,who, aswehave seen,'* isoften supposed toenter
intotheanimal before itisslain;andwhoever drinks
wine drinks theblood, andsoreceives intohimself
thesoulorspirit, ofthegodofthevine.
With regard tothesecond point, thefearofpassing
under blood orunder aliving person, wearetoldthat
some oftheAustralian blacks have adread ofpassing
under aleaning tree oreven under the rails ofa
fence. The reason they give isthatawoman may

from hermayhave fallen on itandmight fallfrom it
onthem.^ InUgi, oneoftheSolomon Islands, a
man will never, ifhecanhelp it,passunder atree
which has fallen across thepath, forthereason that
awoman may have stepped over itbefore him."
Amongst theKarens ofBurma "going under ahouse,
especially ifthere arefemales within, isavoided;as
isalso thepassing under trees ofwhich thebranches
extend downwards inaparticular direction, andthe
but-end offallen trees, etc."^ TheSiamese think it
unlucky topassunder aropeonwhich women's clothes

Probably inallsuch cases therule isbased ona
fearofbeing brought intocontact with blood, especi-
allytheblood ofwomen. From alike fearaMaori
willnever lean hisback against thewall ofanative

disastrous effects upon males. IntheEncounter Bay

oftheBooandik tribe think that ifthey seetheblood

The people ofCeram also believe thatmenwho see

Again, thereason fornotpassing under dangerous
objects, likeavine orwomen's blood, isafear that
theymaycome incontact with thehead;foramong
primitive people thehead ispeculiarly sacred. The
special sanctity attributed toitissometimes explained
byabelief that itistheseat ofaspirit which is
very sensitive toinjury ordisrespect. Thus the
Karens suppose thatabeing called the tsoresides in
theupper part ofthehead, andwhile itretains its
seatnoharm canbefall theperson from theefforts of
theseven Kelahs, orpersonified passions. "But if
the tsobecomes heedless orweak certain evil tothe

attended to,and allpossible pains aretaken toprovide
such dress and attire aswillbepleasing tothe tso.''^''

guardian spirit. The spirit must becarefully protected
from injury ofevery kind ;hence theactofshaving
orcutting thehair isaccompanied withmany cere-
monies. TheKhian isvery sensitive onpoints of
honour, andwould feelmortally insulted ifthehead
inwhich heresides were touched bythehand ofa
stranger. When Dr.Bastian, inconversation with a
brother oftheking ofSiam, raised hishand totouch
theprince's skull inorder toillustrate some medical
remarks hewasmaking, asullen and threatening
murmur bursting from the lips ofthecrouching
courtiers warned himofthebreach ofetiquette hehad
committed, forinSiam there isnogreater insult toa
man ofrank than totouch hishead. IfaSiamese
touch thehead ofanother with hisfoot,both ofthem
must build chapels totheearth -spirit toavert the
omen. Nordoes theguardian spirit ofthehead like
tohave thehairwashed toooften;itmight injure or
incommode him. Itwasagrand solemnity when the
king ofBurmah's headwaswashed withwater taken
from themiddle ofthe river. Whenever thenative
professor, fromwhom Dr.Bastian took lessons in
Burmese atMandalay, had hishead washed, which
took place asaruleonce amonth, hewasgenerally
absent forthree days together, thattime being con-
sumed inpreparing for,and recovering from, the
operation ofhead-washing. Dr.Bastian's custom of
washing hishead dailygave risetomuch remark.^
Again, theBurmese think itanindignity tohave
anyone, especially awoman, over their heads, and for
thisreason Burmese houses have never more thanone
story. The houses areraised onposts above the
ground, andwhenever anything fellthrough the'floor

Dr.Bastian had always difficulty inpersuading a
servant tofetch itfromunder thehouse. InRangoon

climbed upaladder andgotinatthewindow rather

passed under agallery. ApiousBurman ofRangoon,
finding some images ofBuddha inaship's cabin,
offered ahigh price forthem, thattheymight notbe
degraded bysailors walking overthem onthedeck.^
Similarily theCambodians esteem itagrave offence
totouch aman's head;some ofthem willnotenter a
place where anything whatever issuspended over
theirheads ;andthemeanest Cambodian would never
consent toliveunder aninhabited room. Hence the
houses are built ofone story only ;andeven the
Government respects theprejudice bynever placing
aprisoner inthestocks under thefloor ofahouse,
though thehouses areraised highabove theground."^
Thesame superstition exists amongst theMalays
;
foranearly traveller reports that inJava people "wear
nothing ontheir heads, andsaythatnothing must
beontheir heads . . .and ifanyperson were toput
hishand upon their head theywould killhim;and
theydonotbuild houses with storeys, inorder that

head ofaMaori chief was sosacred that "ifhe
only touched itwith his fingers, hewas obliged
immediately toapply them tohisnose,andsnuff up
thesanctity which theyhadacquired bythetouch,
andthus restore ittothepartfromwhence itwas

isforbidden totouch hishead atall.Thus inNorth

crime forasacred person inNew Zealand toleave

might notwalkunder avinewasthefear ofbringing
hissacred head intocontact with thespirit ofthevine.
When thehead wasconsidered sosacred that it
might notevenbetouched without grave offence, itis
obvious thatthecutting ofthehairmust have been
adelicate and difficult operation. The difficulties and
dangers which, onthe primitive view, beset the
operation areoftwokinds. There isfirst thedanger
ofdisturbing the spirit ofthehead, which may be
injured intheprocess andmayrevenge itselfupon the
person who molests him. Secondly, there isthe
difficulty ofdisposing oftheshorn locks. For the
savage believes thatthesympathetic connection which
exists between himself andevery part ofhisbody
continues toexist even after thephysical connection
hasbeen severed, and that therefore hewill suffer
fromanyharm thatmay befall thesevered parts of
hisbody, such astheclippings ofhishair orthe
parings ofhis nails. Accordingly hetakes care that
these severed portions ofhimself shall notbeleft in
places where theymight either beexposed toacci-
dental injury or fall into thehands ofmalicious
persons who might work magic onthem tohis
detriment ordeath. Such dangers arecommon to
all,butsacred persons havemore tofearfromthem
than ordinary people, sotheprecautions taken by
them areproportionately stringent. The simplest
way ofevading thedanger isofcourse nottocut
thehair atall ;and this istheexpedient adopted
where thedanger isthought tobemore than usually
ofreat. ThePrankish kinors were notallowed tocut
their hair.^AHaida medicine-man may neither cut

Amongst theAlfoers ofCelebes theLeleen orpriest
wholooks after the rice-fields may notcuthishair

that is,from amonth before therice issown until itis

married men did so,theywould lose their wives;if

they might work hisdestruction through it.The
Egyptians onajourney kept their hair uncut till

might nothave hishair cut :"Allthedays ofthe
vowofhisseparation there shall norazorcome upon
hishead."^ Possibly inthiscase there wasaspecial
objection totouching thetabooed man's head with
iron. TheRoman priests, aswehave seen, were
shorn with bronze knives. Thesame feeling prob-
ablygave rise totheEuropean rule that achild's
nails should notbecutduring the first year, but
that ifitisabsolutely necessary toshorten them they

Butwhen itisnecessary tocutthe hair, pre-
cautions aretaken tolessen thedangers which are
supposed toattend theoperation. Amongst the

was surehehadburied itand that itwas rotting,
"Her hair," she said,"was rotting somewhere, and
herMarm-bu-la (kidney fat)waswasting away, and
when herhairhadcompletely rotted, shewould die."^
AMarquesan chief toldLieutenant Gamble thathe

lock ofhishairandburied itinaplantain leaf for
thepurpose oftaking his life. Lieut. Gamble argued
with him, but invain;diehemust unless thehair

toobtain them hehad offered theHappahs the

charm iswellknown.
Some people burn their loose hair tosave itfrom
falling into thepower ofsorcerers. This isdone by
thePatagonians andsome oftheVictorian tribes.-
TheMakololo ofSouth Africa either burn itorbury
itsecretly,^ and thesame alternative issometimes
adopted bytheTirolese.^ Cutandcombed outhair is
burned inPomerania andsometimes atLiege.^ In
Norway theparings ofnails areeither burned orburied,
lesttheelves ortheFinns should findthemandmake
them into bullets wherewith toshoot the cattle.^
This destruction ofthehair ornails plainly involves
aninconsistency ofthought. The object ofthede-
struction isavowedly toprevent these severed portions
ofthebody from being usedbysorcerers. Butthe
possibility oftheir being soused depends upon the
supposed sympathetic connection between them and
themanfromwhom theywere severed. And ifthis
sympathetic connection still exists, clearly these severed
portions cannot bedestroyed without injury tothe
man.
Before leaving this subject, onwhich Ihave per-
haps dwelt toolong, itmaybewell tocallattention to
themotive assigned forcutting ayoung child's hair in

bythevirus ofthetaboo and assuch aredangerous.
The cutting ofthe child's hairwould thusbeexactly
parallel tothedestruction ofthevessels which have

outbyapractice, observed bysome Australians, of
burning offpart ofawoman's hair after childbirth as
well asburning every vessel which hasbeen usedby
herduring herseclusion.- Here theburning ofthe
woman's hairseems plainly intended toserve thesame
purpose astheburning ofthevessels usedbyher;and
asthevessels areburned because theyarebelieved tobe
tainted with adangerous infection, so,wemust suppose,
isalso the hair.We can, therefore, understand the
importance attached bymany peoples tothe first cut-
tingofachild's hairandtheelaborate ceremonies by
which theoperation isaccompanied.^ Again, wecan
understand why aman should poll hishead after a
journey.* Forwehave seen that atraveller isoften
believed tocontract adangerous infection from
strangers and that, therefore, onhisreturn home heis
obliged tosubmit tovarious purificatory ceremonies
before he isallowed tomingle freely with hisown

simply oneofthese purificatory ordisinfectant cere-

Asmight have been expected, thesuperstitions of
thesavage cluster thick about thesubject offood ;and
heabstains from eating many animals and plants,
wholesome enough inthemselves, butwhich forone
reason oranother heconsiders would prove dangerous
orfatal tothe eater. Examples ofsuch abstinence
aretoofamiliar and fartoonumerous toquote. But
iftheordinary man isthus deterred bysuperstitious
fearfrom partaking ofvarious foods, therestraints of
thiskindwhich arelaidupon sacred ortabooed per-
sons, such askings and priests, are stillmorenumerous
andstringent. Wehave already seen thattheFlamen
Dialis wasforbidden toeatorevenname several plants
andanimals, and that the flesh dietoftheEgyptian
kings wasrestricted tovealandgoose." TheGangas
orfetish priests oftheLoango Coast areforbidden to

often they liveonlyonherbs and roots, though they

ofManipur (adistrict ofEastern India, ontheborder
ofBurma), "there aremany prohibitions inregard to

history andbeliefs ofthetribe thanwepossess. The
o-eneral motive ofsuch prohibitions isdoubtless the
same which underlies thewhole taboo system, namely,
theconservation ofthetribeandtheindividual.
Itwould beeasy toextend the listofroyal and
priestly taboos, buttheabovemay suffice asspecimens.
Toconclude thispartofoursubject itonlyremains to
statesummarily thegeneral conclusions towhich our
inquiries have thus farconducted us.Wehave seen

posed divinity istheessential factwithwhich wehave
todeal. Invirtue ofitthey areapledge andguar-
antee totheir worshippers ofthecontinuance and
orderly succession ofthose physical phenomena upon
which mankind depends forsubsistence. Naturally,
therefore, the lifeand health ofsuch agod-man are
matters ofanxious concern tothepeople whose welfare
andeven existence arebound upwith his ;naturally
heisconstrained bythem toconform tosuch rules as
thewitofearlyman hasdevised foraverting the ills
towhich flesh isheir, including the last ill,death.
These rules, asanexamination ofthem hasshown, are
nothing butthemaxims with which, ontheprimitive
view, everyman ofcommon prudence must comply
ifhewould livelong intheland. Butwhile inthe
case ofordinary men theobservance oftherules is
lefttothechoice oftheindividual, inthecase ofthe
god-man itisenforced under penalty ofdismissal from
hishigh station, oreven ofdeath. For hisworship-

KILLING THEGOD

§I,—
Killing thedivine king
Lacking theidea ofeternal duration primitive man
naturally supposes thegods tobemortal likehimself.
TheGreenlanders believed thatawind could killtheir
most powerful god,and thathewould certainly die
ifhetouched adog.When theyheard oftheChristian
God, they kept asking ifhe7iever died, andbeing
informed thathedid not,theyweremuch surprised
and said thathemust beavery great god indeed.^
Inanswer totheinquiries ofColonel Dodge, aNorth
American Indian stated that theworld wasmade by
theGreat Spirit. Being asked which Great Spirit he
meant, thegood oneorthebadone,"Oh, neither of
them.'' replied he,"the Great Spirit thatmade the
world isdead long ago.Hecould notpossibly have
lived aslong asthis.""- Atribe inthePhilippine
Islands toldtheSpanish conquerors thatthegrave of

theCreator wasupon thetopofMount Cabunian.^
Heitsi-eibib, agodordivine hero oftheHottentots,
died several times andcame toHfeagain. Hisgraves
aregenerally tobemetwith innarrow passes between
mountains.- The grave ofZeus, thegreat godof
Greece, wasshown tovisiters inCrete aslateasabout
thebeginning ofourera.^ Thebody ofDionysus was
buried atDelphi beside thegolden statue ofApollo,
andhistomb bore theinscription, 'T-iere liesDionysus
dead, thesonofSemele."^ According tooneaccount,
Apollo himself wasburied atDelphi ;forPythagoras

setting forthhow thegodhadbeen killed bythe
python and buried under the tripod.^ Cronus was
buried inSicily,'^andthegraves ofHermes, Aphrodite,
andAres wereshown inHermopoHs, Cyprus, and
Thrace.^
Ifthegreat invisible gods arethussupposed to
die, itisnottobeexpected thatagodwho dwells in
thefleshandblood ofamanshould escape thesame
fate.Now primitive peoples, aswehave seen, some-
times believe that their safety andeven that ofthe
world isbound upwith the lifeofoneofthese god-
men orhuman incarnations ofthedivinity. Naturally,
therefore, they take theutmost care ofhis life,outof
aregard fortheir own. Butnoamount ofcareand
precaution willprevent theman-god fromgrowing old
and feeble and atlastdying. Hisworshippers have

tolaytheir account with thissadnecessity and to
meet itasbestthey can.Thedanger isaformidable
one;for ifthecourse ofnature isdependent onthe
man-god's life,what catastrophes maynotbeexpected
from thegradual enfeeblement ofhispowers andtheir
final extinction indeath ?There isonlyoneway
ofaverting these dangers. Theman-god must be
killed assoon asheshows symptoms that hispowers
arebeginning tofail,and hissoulmust betransferred
toavigorous successor before ithasbeen seriously
impaired bythethreatened decay. Theadvantages
ofthusputting theman-god todeath instead ofallow-
inghim todieofoldageand disease are, tothe
savage, obvious enough. For iftheman-god dies
whatwe callanatural death, itmeans, according
tothesavage, that hissoul has either voluntarily
departed from hisbodyandrefuses toreturn, ormore
commonly that ithasbeen extracted oratleastdetained
initswanderings byademon orsorcerer,^ Inanyof
these cases thesoul oftheman-god islost tohis
worshippers;andwith ittheir prosperity isgone and
their very existence endangered. Even ifthey could
arrange tocatch thesoulofthedying godasitlefthis
lipsorhisnostrils andsotransfer ittoasuccessor, this
would not effect their purpose ;for,thus dying of
disease, hissoulwould necessarily leave hisbody in
thelaststage ofweakness andexhaustion, andassuch
itwould continue todrag outafeeble existence inthe
body towhich itmight betransferred. Whereas by
killing him hisworshippers could, inthe first place,
make sure ofcatching hissoul as itescaped and
transferring ittoasuitable successor ;and, inthe
second place, bykilling himbefore hisnatural force

PREFERENCE FOR
wasabated, theywould secure that theworld should
not fallintodecay with thedecay oftheman-god.
Every purpose, therefore, wasanswered, and alldangers
averted bythus killing theman-god andtransferring
hissoul, while yetatitsprime, toavigorous successor.
Some ofthereasons forpreferring aviolent death
totheslow death ofoldageordisease areobviously
asapplicable tocommon men astotheman-god. Thus
theMangaians think that "thespirits ofthosewho die
anatural death areexcessively feeble andweak, as
their bodies were atdissolution ;whereas thespirits ot
thosewhoareslain inbattle arestrong andvigorous,
their bodies nothaving been reduced bydisease."^
Hence, mensometimes prefer tokillthemselves orto
bekilled before theygrow feeble, inorder that inthe
future lifetheir soulsmay start fresh andvigorous as
they lefttheir bodies, instead ofdecrepit andworn out
withageanddisease. Thus inFiji,"self-immolation
isbynomeans rare,andthey believe that asthey
leave this life,sothey willremain ever after. This
forms apowerful motive toescape from decrepitude,
orfrom acrippled condition, byavoluntary death.'"'
Or,asanother observer oftheFijians puts itmore
fully, "the custom ofvoluntary suicide onthepartof
theoldmen,which isamong theirmost extraordinary
usages, isalsoconnected with their superstitions respect-
ingafuture life.They believe thatpersons enter
upon thedelights oftheir elysium with thesame
faculties, mental and physical, that they possess at
thehour ofdeath, inshort, that the spiritual life
commences where thecorporeal existence terminates.

hisstrength declining with theadvance ofage,and
feels thathewillsoon beunequal todischarge the

that"they never letaperson dieanatural death, but

The Ethiopian kings ofMeroe were worshipped as

messenger totheking, ordering him todie,andalleg-
inganoracle ofthegods astheir authority forthe

down tothereign ofErgamenes, acontemporary of
Ptolemy II,King ofEgypt. Having received a
Greek education which emancipated himfrom thesuper-
stitions ofhiscountrymen, Ergamenes ventured todis-
regard thecommand ofthepriests, and,entering the
Golden Temple with abody ofsoldiers, putthepriests

asthelossofatooth, wasconsidered asufficient cause
forputting oneofthesegod-men todeath, aswelearn
from thefollowing passage ofanoldhistorian. "Con-
tiguous tothedomains oftheOuiteva [theking ofthe

another prince called Sedanda. This prince becoming
afflicted with leprosy, resolved onfollowing implicitly
thelaws ofthecountry, andpoisoning himself, con-
ceiving hismalady tobeincurable, oratleast that it
would render him soloathsome intheeyes ofhis
people thattheywould with difficulty recognise him.
Inconsequence henominated hissuccessor, holding as
hisopinion that sovereigns who should serve inall

able being, much lessamonarch, ought toanticipate
thescythe oftime;and, abrogating thismortal law,
heordained that allhissuccessors, ifsane, should fol-
lowtheprecedent hegave, andthenewlawestablished
byhim."^
ThisKing ofSofala was, therefore, aboldreformer
likeErgamenes, King ofEthiopia. Wemay con-
jecture that theground forputting theEthiopian
kings todeath was, asinthecase oftheZulu and
Sofala kings, theappearance ontheir person ofany
bodily defect orsign ofdecay;and that theoracle
which thepriests alleged astheauthority fortheroyal
execution was totheeffect thatgreat calamities would
result from thereign ofakingwhohadanyblemish
onhisbody;justasanoracle warned Sparta against
a"lame reign," that is,thereign ofalame king.^
This conjecture isconfirmed bythefactthatthekings
ofEthiopia were chosen fortheir size, strength, and
beauty long before thecustom ofkilling them was
abolished.^ TothisdaytheSultan ofWadai must
have noobvious bodily defect, andaking ofAngoy
cannot becrowned ifhehasasingle blemish, such as
abroken orfiled tooth orthescarofanoldwound.'*
Itisonly natural, therefore, tosuppose, especially

appointed toreign inhisturnayear,and suffer death
attheendof it.Atleast this istheconclusion to
which thefollowing evidence points. According to
thehistorian Berosus, who asaBabylonian priest
spoke withample knowledge, there wasannually cele-
brated inBabylon afestival called theSacaea. It
began onthei6thdayofthemonth Lous, and lasted
forfive days. During these fivedays masters and
servants changed places, theservants giving orders
andthemasters obeying them.Aprisoner condemned
todeath wasdressed intheking's robes, seated onthe
king's throne, allowed toissuewhatever commands he
pleased, toeat, drink, andenjoy himself, and tolie
with theking's concubines. But attheend ofthe
fivedayshewasstripped ofhisroyal robes, scourged,
and crucified.^ Thiscustom might perhaps havebeen
explained asmerely agrim jestperpetrated inaseason
ofjollity attheexpense ofanunhappy criminal. But
onecircumstance —theleave given tothemock king
toenjoy theking's concubines—isdecisive against this
interpretation. Considering thejealous seclusion of

anoriental despot's harem wemaybequite certain
thatpermission toinvade itwould never have been
granted bythedespot, least ofalltoacondemned
criminal, except forthevery gravest cause. This
cause could hardly beother than that thecondemned
manwasabout todie intheking's stead, and that to
make thesubstitution perfect itwas necessary he
should enjoy the fullrights ofroyalty during hisbrief
reign. There isnothing surprising inthis substi-
tution. The rulethat thekingmust beputtodeath
either ontheappearance ofanysymptom ofbodily
decay orattheendofafixed period iscertainly one
which, sooner orlater, thekings would seek toabolish
ormodify. Wehave seen that inEthiopia andSofala
therulewasboldly setasidebyenlightened monarchs
;
and that inCalicut theoldcustom ofkilling theking
attheendoftwelve years waschanged intoaper-
mission granted toanyone attheendofthetwelve
years' period toattack theking, and, intheevent of
killing him, toreign inhisstead;though, astheking
took care atthese times tobesurrounded byhis
guards, thepermission was littlemore than aform.
Another way ofmodifying thestern oldrule isseen
intheBabylonian custom justdescribed. When the
timedrew near fortheking tobeput todeath (in
Babylon thisappears tohave been attheendofa
single year's reign) heabdicated forafewdays, during
which atemporary king reigned and suffered inhis
stead. Atfirstthetemporary kingmayhavebeenan
innocent person, possibly amember oftheking'sown
family; butwith thegrowth ofcivilisation thesacrifice
ofaninnocent person would berevolting tothepublic
sentiment, andaccordingly acondemned criminal would
beinvested with thebriefand fatal sovereignty. In

thesequel weshall findother examples ofadying
criminal representing adying god. Forwemust not
forget that theking isslain inhischaracter ofa
god, hisdeath and resurrection, astheonlymeans of
perpetuating thedivine lifeunimpaired, being deemed
necessary forthesalvation ofhispeople andtheworld.
Insome places thismodified form oftheoldcustom
hasbeen further softened down. Theking stillab-
dicates annually forashort timeand hisplace isfilled
byamore orlessnominal sovereign;but attheclose
ofhisshort reign thelatter isnolonger killed, though
sometimes amock execution stillsurvives asamemorial
ofthetimewhen hewas actually puttodeath. To
takeexamples. Inthemonth ofMeac (February) the
King ofCambodia annually abdicated forthree days.
During thistimeheperformed noactofauthority, he
didnottouch theseals, hedidnoteven receive the
revenues which felldue. Inhisstead there reigned a
temporary king called Sdach Meac, that is,King Feb-

day, after theusual procession, thetemporary king
gave orders that theelephants should trample under

InUpper Egypt onthe firstdayofthesolar year
byCoptic reckoning, that isonlothSeptember, when
theNile hasgenerally reached itshighest point, the
regular government issuspended forthree daysand
every town chooses itsown ruler. This temporary
lordwears asortoftall fool's capandalong flaxen
beard, and isenveloped inastrange mantle. With a
wand ofoffice inhishand andattended bymen dis-
guised asscribes, executioners, etc.,heproceeds tothe

deposed;andthemock king, mounting thethrone,
holds atribunal, tothedecisions ofwhich even the
governor andhisofficials mustbow. After three days
themock king iscondemned todeath;theenvelope
orshell inwhich hewasencased iscommitted tothe
flames, andfrom itsashes theFellah creeps forth.'
Sometimes thetemporary king occupies thethrone,
notannually, butonce forallatthebeginning ofeach

exercise theroyal prerogatives forasingle day.The
origin ofthecustom isexplained byatradition that
there were once five royal brothers, thefour elder
ofwhom alldeclined thecrown ontheground of
various bodily defects, leaving ittotheir youngest
brother. Buttheeldest occupied thethrone forone
day,andreserved forhisdescendants asimilar privilege
atthebeginning ofevery reign. Thus the office of
temporary king ishereditary inafamily akin tothe
royal house.^ InBilaspur itseems tobethecustom,
after thedeath ofaRajah, foraBrahman toeatrice
outofthedead Rajah's hand, andthen tooccupy the
throne forayear. AttheendoftheyeartheBrahman
receives presents and isdismissed from theterritory,
being forbidden apparently toreturn. "Theideaseems

ontosurrender themarble seat totheprince oncon-
dition ofreceiving sixty pence, thecowandmare, and
exemption from taxes. Butbefore yielding hisplace
hegave theprince alightblowonthecheek.^
Some points about these temporary kings deserve
tobespecially noticed before wepass tothenext
branch oftheevidence. Inthe first place, theCam-
bodian andSiamese examples bring clearly outthe
factthat itisespecially thedivine orsupernatural func-
tions ofthekingwhich aretransferred tohistemporary
substitute. Thisappears from thebelief thatbykeeping
uphisfootthetemporary kingofSiam gained avictory
over the evil spirits;whereas byletting itdown he
imperilled theexistence ofthestate. Again, theCam-
bodian ceremony oftrampling down the"mountain
ofrice," andtheSiamese ceremony ofopening the
ploughing andsowing, arecharms toproduce aplentiful
harvest, asappears from thebelief thatthosewhocarry
homesome ofthetrampled riceoroftheseedsown
willthereby secure agood crop. Butthetaskofmaking
thecrops grow, thusdeputed tothetemporary kings,
isoneofthesupernatural functions regularly supposed
tobedischarged bykings inprimitive society. The
rulethatthemock kingmust stand ononefootupon
araised seat inthe rice-field wasperhaps originally
meant asacharm tomake thecropgrow high;at
least thiswastheobject ofasimilar ceremony observed
bytheoldPrussians. The tallest girl,standing onone
footupon aseat, with her lap fullofcakes, acup
ofbrandy inherrighthand andapiece ofelm-bark

orlinden -bark inher left,prayed tothegodWaiz-
ganthos that the flaxmight grow ashigh asshe

itrefilled, andpoured thebrandy ontheground as
anoffering toWaizganthos, andthrewdown thecakes
forhisattendant sprites. Ifsheremained steady on
one footthroughout theceremony, itwasanomen
that the flaxcropwould begood;but ifshe lether
footdown, itwas feared that thecropmight fail.^
Thegilded plough withwhich theSiamese mock king
opens theploughing maybecompared withthebronze
ploughs which theEtruscans employed atthecere-
mony offounding cities;-inboth cases theuseof
ironwasprobably forbidden onsuperstitious grounds.^
Another point tonotice about these temporary
kings isthat intwo places (Cambodia andJambi)
theycome ofastock which isbelieved tobeakin
totheroyal family. Iftheview here taken ofthe
origin ofthese temporary kingships iscorrect, thefact
thatthetemporary king issometimes ofthesame race
astherealkingadmits ofaready explanation. When
theking firstsucceeded ingetting the lifeofanother
accepted asasacrifice inlieuofhisown, hewould
have toshow thatthedeath ofthatother would serve
thepurpose quite aswell ashisownwould have done.
Now itwasasagodthatthekinghad todie;there-
forethesubstitute whodied forhimhadtobeinvested,
atleast fortheoccasion, with thedivine attributes of
theking. This, aswehave just seen,was certainly
thecasewith thetemporary kings ofSiam andCam-

bodia ;they were invested with the supernatural
functions, which inanearHer stage ofsociety were
thespecial attributes oftheking. Butnoonecould
sowell represent theking inhisdivine character as
hisson,whomight besupposed toshare thedivine
afflatus ofhis father. Noone, therefore, could so
appropriately diefortheking and,through him, for
thewhole people, astheking's son.There isevidence
thatamongst theSemites ofWestern Asia (thevery
region where theredemption oftheking's lifebythe
sacrifice ofanother comes outsounmistakably in
theSacaean festival) theking, inatime ofnational
danger, sometimes gave hisown son todieasa
sacrifice forthepeople. Thus Philo ofByblus,
inhiswork ontheJews, says :"Itwasanancient
custom inacrisis ofgreat danger that theruler ofa
cityornation should give hisbeloved sontodiefor
thewhole people, asaransom offered totheavenging
demons;andthechildren thus offered were slain with
mystic rites. SoCronus, whom thePhoenicians call
Israel, being king ofthelandandhaving anonly-
begotten soncalled Jeoud (forinthePhoenician tongue
Jeoud signifies 'only-begotten'), dressed him inroyal
robes andsacrificed himuponanaltar inatime ofwar,
when thecountry was ingreat danger from theenemy."^
When theKing ofMoab wasbesieged bytheIsraelites
andhard beset, hetook hiseldest son,who should
have reigned inhisstead, andoffered him foraburnt
offering onthewall.- Butamongst theSemites the
practice ofsacrificing their children wasnotconfined
tokings. Intimes ofgreat calamity, such as
pestilence, drought, ordefeat inwar, thePhoenicians

sacrifices."^ When theCarthaginians were defeated
andbesieged byAgathocles, they ascribed their dis-
asters tothewrath ofBaal;forwhereas informer
times theyhadbeenwont tosacrifice tohimtheirown
children, theyhad latterly fallen into thehabit ofbuy-
ingchildren andrearing them tobevictims. So,to
appease theangry god,twohundred children ofthe
noblest families were picked outforsacrifice, andthe
taleofvictims wasswelled bynot lessthan three
hundred morewhovolunteered todieforthefather-
land. They were sacrificed bybeing placed, oneby
one,onthesloping hands ofthebrazen image, from
which they rolled intoapitoffire." Ifanaristocracy
thusadopted thepractice ofsacrificing other people's
children instead oftheir own, kingsmay very well
have followed orsettheexample. Afinal mitigation
ofthecustom would bethesubstitution ofcondemned
criminals forinnocent victims. Such asubstitution
isknown tohave taken place inthehuman sacrifices
annually offered inRhodes toBaal.^
Thecustom ofsacrificing children, especially the
first born, isnotpeculiarly Semitic. Insome tribes
ofNew South Wales thefirst-born child ofevery
woman waseaten bythetribe aspart ofareligious
ceremony.'^ The Indians ofFlorida sacrificed their
first-born male children.'^ Amongst thepeople of

theseasons became regular again. Toavert the
recurrence ofsuch aconfusion oftheseasons, the
soothsayers arereported tohave enjoined theking

Since then certain families areobliged todeliver up

Thecondemnation andpretended death byfireof
themock king inEgypt isprobably areminiscence
ofarealcustom ofburning him. Evidence ofa
practice ofburning divine personages willbeforth-
coming later on. InBilaspur theexpulsion ofthe
Brahman whohadoccupied the king's throne for
ayear isperhaps asubstitute forputting him to
death.
The explanation here given ofthecustom of
killing divine persons assumes, oratleast isreadily
combined with, theidea that thesoul ofthe slain
divinity istransmitted tohissuccessor. Ofthistrans-
mission Ihave nodirect proof; andsofaralink in
1J.L.Krapf, Travels, Researches, maybedoubted, butthat the restof
and Missionary Labours during an thestory harmonises wellenough with
Eighteen Years' Residence inEastern African superstition.

thechain ofevidence iswanting. But ifIcannot
prove byactual examples thissuccession tothesoul
ofthe slain god, itcan atleast bemade probable
thatsuch asuccession wassupposed totake place.
For ithasbeen already shown that thesoul ofthe
incarnate deity isoften supposed totransmigrate at
death into another incarnation;^and ifthis takes
place when thedeath isanatural one, there seems
noreason why itshould nottake place when the
death isaviolent one. Certainly theidea that the
soul ofadying person may betransmitted tohis
successor isperfectly familiar toprimitive peoples.
InNias theeldest sonusually succeeds hisfather
inthe chieftainship. But iffrom any bodily or
mental defect the eldest son isincapacitated from
ruling, thefather determines inhis life-time which
ofhissons shall succeed him. Inorder, however,
toestablish hisright ofsuccession itisnecessary
thatthesonuponwhom hisfather's choice falls shall
catch inhismouth orinabagthe lastbreath, and
with itthe soul, ofthedying chief. Forwhoever
catches his last breath ischief equally with the
appointed successor. Hence theother brothers, and
sometimes also strangers, crowd round thedying
man tocatch hissoul as itpasses. Thehouses in
Nias areraised above theground onposts, and it
hashappened thatwhen thedying man laywith his
faceonthe floor, oneofthecandidates hasbored a
hole inthe floor and sucked inthe chief's last
breath through abamboo tube.When thechief has
noson, hissoul iscaught inabag,which isfastened
toanimage made torepresent thedeceased ;the

soul isthen believed topass into the image.^
Amongst theTakilis orCarrier Indians ofNorth-
West America, when acorpse isburned thepriest
pretends tocatch thesoulofthedeceased inhishands,
which hecloses withmany gesticulations. Hethen
communicates thecaptured soul tothedead man's
successor bythrowing hishands towards andblowing
upon him. The person towhom thesoul isthus
communicated takes thename and rank ofthe
deceased. Onthedeath ofachief the priest thus
fillsaresponsible and influential position, forhemay
transmit thesoul towhom hewill,though, doubtless,
hegenerally follows theregular line ofsuccession.'
Algonkin women who wished tobecome mothers
flocked totheside ofadying person inthehope of
receiving andbeing impregnated bythepassing soul.
Amongst theSeminoles ofFlorida when awoman
died inchildbed the infant was held over herface
toreceive herparting spirit.^ TheRomans caught
thebreath ofdying friends intheir mouths, andso
received intothemselves thesoul ofthedeparted.*
Thesame custom issaid tobe still practised in
Lancashire.^ Wemay therefore fairly suppose that
when thedivine king orpriest isput todeath his
spirit isbelieved topass into hissuccessor.

240 KILLING THE
§2.—
Killing thetree-spirit
Itremains toaskwhat light thecustom ofkilHng
thedivine king orpriest sheds upon thesubject ofour
inquiry. Inthe firstchapter wesawreason tosuppose
thattheKing oftheWood wasregarded asanincar-
nation ofthetree-spirit orofthespirit ofvegetation,
andthatassuchhewould beendowed, inthebelief of
hisworshippers, with asupernatural power ofmaking
thetrees tobear fruit, thecrops togrow, andsoon.
His lifemust therefore have been heldvery precious
byhisworshippers, andwas probably hedged in
byasystem ofelaborate precautions ortaboos
likethose bywhich, insomany places, the lifeof
thegod-man hasbeenguarded against themalignant
influence ofdemons andsorcerers. Butwehave seen
that thevery value attached tothe lifeoftheman-
god necessitates hisviolent death astheonlymeans
ofpreserving itfrom theinevitable decay ofage.
Thesame reasoning would apply totheKing ofthe
Wood ;hetoohad tobekilled inorder that the
divine spirit, incarnate inhim,might betransferred
inunabated vigour tohissuccessor. The rule that
heheld office tillastronger should slayhimmight
besupposed tosecure both thepreservation ofhis
divine life infullvigour and itstransference to
asuitable successor assoon asthat vigour began
tobeimpaired. For solong ashecould maintain
hisposition bythestrong hand, itmight beinferred
that hisnatural force wasnotabated;whereas his
defeat anddeath atthehands ofanother proved
that hisstrength wasbeginning tofailand that it
wastime hisdivine lifeshould belodg-ed inaless

dilapidated tabernacle. This explanation oftherule
that theKing oftheWood had tobeslainbyhis
successor atleast renders that ruleperfectly intelligible.
Moreover itiscountenanced bytheanalogy ofthe
Chitombe, uponwhose lifetheexistence oftheworld
wassupposed tohang, andwhowastherefore slainby
hissuccessor assoon asheshowed signs ofbreaking
up. Again, theterms onwhich inlater times the
King ofCalicut held office areidentical with those
attached tothe office ofKing oftheWood, except
thatwhereas theformer might beassailed bya
candidate atany time, theKing ofCalicut might
onlybeattacked once every twelve years. But as
theleave granted totheKing ofCalicut toreign
solong ashecould defend himself against all
comers wasamitigation oftheoldrulewhich seta
fixed term tohis life,sowemayconjecture that the
similar permission granted totheKing oftheWood
wasamitigation ofanolder custom ofputting him
todeath attheendofasetperiod. Inboth cases the
new rulegave tothegod-man atleast achance for
his life,which under theoldrulewasdenied him;and
people probably reconciled themselves tothechange
byreflecting that solong asthegod-man could
maintain himself bythesword against allassaults,
there wasnoreason toapprehend that the fatal
decay hadsetin.
The conjecture that theKing oftheWood was
formerly put todeath attheexpiry ofasetterm,
without being allowed achance forhis life, willbe
confirmed ifevidence canbeadduced ofacustom
ofperiodically killing hiscounterparts, thehumxan
representatives ofthetree-spirit, inNorthern Europe.

InLower Bavaria theWhitsuntide representative
ofthetree-spirit—thePfingstl ashewas called—was

andsurmounted with anosegay ofpeonies. The
sleeves ofhiscoatwere alsomade ofwater-plants, and

people, inhiding, soused theleaf-clad boywith water.
Allrejoiced when hewaswell drenched. Finally he
waded into thebrook uptohismiddle;whereupon
oneoftheboys, standing onthebridge, pretended
tocut offhishead.^ AtWurmlingen inSwabia
ascore ofyoung fellows dress themselves onWhit-
Monday inwhite shirts andwhite trousers, with
redscarves round their waists andswords hanging

tothemarket-place, where theywere chased upand

about with strange gestures andspirted blood onthe
people from bladders which they carried. When they
were down, thehuntsmen placed them onboards
andcarried them tothealehouse, theminers march-

Theceremony ofdecapitation, which isheresomewhat

Inthepersonages whoarethus slain inmimicry it
isimpossible nottorecognise representatives ofthe

flowers inwhich theactors aredressed, andtheseason
oftheyear atwhich theyappear, show thattheybelong
tothesame class astheGrass King, King oftheMay,
Jack-in-the-Green, andother representatives ofthe
vernal spirit ofvegetation which weexamined inthe

incarnation asheadvances inyears, itmustbedetached
from him before, oratleast assoon as,heexhibits
signs ofdecay, inorder tobetransferred toavigorous
successor. This isdonebykilling theoldrepresenta-
tiveofthegodandconveying thedivine spirit from
him toanew incarnation. The killing ofthegod,
that is,ofhishuman incarnation, is,therefore, only a
necessary step tohisrevival orresurrection inabetter
form. Farfrom being anextinction ofthedivine
spirit, itisonly thebeginning ofapurer andstronger

thecustom ofkilling divine kings and priests in
general, itisstillmore obviously applicable tothe
custom ofannually killing therepresentative ofthe
tree-spirit orspirit ofvegetation inspring. Forthe
decay ofvegetation inwinter isreadily interpreted by
primitive man asanenfeeblement ofthe spirit ofvege-
tation;thespirit has(hethinks) grown oldandweak
andmust therefore berenovated bybeing slainand
brought tolifeinayounger andfresher form. Thus the
killing oftherepresentative ofthetree-spirit inspring is
regarded asameans topromote andquicken the
growth ofvegetation. Forthekilling ofthetree-spirit
isassociated always (wemust suppose) implicitly, and
sometimes explicitly also,with arevival orresurrection
ofhim inamore youthful andvigorous form. Thus

The points ofsimilarity between these North
European personages andthesubject ofourinquiry—theKing oftheWood orpriest ofNemi—are
sufficiently striking. Inthese northern maskers wesee

agility;forinseveral ofthese northern customs the
flight andpursuit oftheking isaprominent partofthe

run hispursuers heretains his lifeand hisoffice for

justastheKing ofCalicut inlater times held office on
condition ofdefending his lifeagainst allcomers once
every twelve years, andjust asthepriest ofNemi held
office oncondition ofdefending himself against any
assault atanytime. Inallthese cases the lifeofthe
god-man isprolonged oncondition ofshowing, ina
severe physical contest offight orflight, that hisbodily
strength isnotdecayed, and that, therefore, theviolent
death, which sooner orlater isinevitable, may forthe
present bepostponed. With regard toflight itis
noticeable that flight figured conspicuously both inthe
legend andthepractice oftheKing oftheWood. He

hadtobearunaway slave {fngitizms) inmemory ofthe
flight ofOrestes, thetraditional founder oftheworship

hence theKings oftheWood aredescribed byan
ancient writer as'
'bothstrong ofhandand fleetoffoot. "^
Perhaps ifweknew theritual oftheArician grove fully
wemight find that thekingwasallowed achance for
his lifebyflight, likehisBohemian brother. Wemay
conjecture thattheannual flight ofthepriestly king at
Rome {regifugmm)'^wasatfirst aflight ofthesame
kind;inother words, thathewasoriginally oneofthose
divine kingswhoareeither puttodeath after afixed
period orallowed toprove bythestrong hand orthe
fleet foot that their divinity isvigorous andunim-
paired. Onemore point ofresemblance may be
noted between the Italian King oftheWood and his
northern counterparts. InSaxony andThilringen the
representative ofthe tree-spirit, after being killed, is
brought tolifeagain byadoctor. This isexactly what
legend affirmed tohavehappened tothe firstKing of
theWood atNemi, Hippolytus orVirbius, who after
hehadbeen killed byhishorses wasrestored tolife
bythephysician Aesculapius.^ Such alegend tallies
wellwith thetheory thattheslaying oftheKing ofthe
Wood wasonly astep tohisrevival orresurrection in
hissuccessor.
Ithasbeenassumed that themock killino^ oftheo

least likely toquestion thetruth ofthisassumption.
Thathuman sacrifices werecommonly offered bythe
ancestors ofthe civilised races ofNorth Europe
(Celts, Teutons, andSlavs) iscertain/ Itisnot,there-
fore, surprising that themodern peasant should doin
mimicry what hisforefathers didinreality. Weknow

Thus Captain Bourke wasinformed byanoldchief
thattheIndians ofArizona used toofferhuman sacri-

Thevictim hadhisthroat cut,hisbreast opened, andhis
heart taken outbyoneofthe priests. Thiscustom
wasabolished bytheMexicans, butforalong time
afterwards amodified form of itwassecretly observed
asfollows. The victim, generally ayoung man,had
histhroat cut,andblood wasallowed toflow freely;

tators isfully convinced ofthe reality ofthissimu-
lated death and resurrection. -Sometimes themock
sacrifice iscarried out,notonaliving person buton
animage. Thus anIndian law-book, theCalica
Puran, prescribes thatwhen the sacrifice oflions,
tigers, orhuman beings isrequired, animage ofa
lion, tiger, orman shallbemade with butter, paste, or
barley meal, and sacrificed instead.^ Some ofthe
Gonds ofIndia formerly offered human sacrifices;they
now sacrifice straw-men instead."^ Colonel Dalton
was told that insome oftheir villages theBhagats
(Hindooised Oraons) "annually make animage ofa
man inwood, putclothes andornaments on it,and
present itbefore thealtar ofaMahadeo. Theperson
who officiates aspriest ontheoccasion says :'O,

Carrying outDeath
Thus far Ihave offered anexplanation ofthe
rulewhich required thatthepriest ofNemi should be
slainbyhissuccessor. The explanation claims tobe
nomore than probable;ourscanty knowledge ofthe
custom andofitshistory forbids ittobemore. But
itsprobability willbeaugmented inproportion to
theextent towhich themotives andmodes ofthought
which itassumes canbeproved tohave operated in
primitive society. Hitherto thegod withwhose
death and resurrection wehave been chiefly con-
cerned hasbeen thetree-god. Tree-worship may
perhaps beregarded (though this isaconjecture)
asoccupying anintermediate place inthehistory
ofreligion, between thereligion ofthehunter and
shepherd ontheone side, whose gods aremostly
animals, andthereligion ofthehusbandman onthe
other hand, inwhose worship thecultivated plants
playaleading part. Ifthen Icanshow thatthecustom
ofkilling thegodandthebelief inhisresurrection ori-
ginated, oratleast existed, inthehunting andpastoral
stage ofsociety, when theslaingodwasananimal, and
survived intotheagricultural stage,when theslaingod

theprobability ofmyexplanation willhave been con-
siderably increased. This Ishall attempt todoin

254 BURYING THECARNIVAL chap.
Ihope toclear upsome obscurities which still
remain, and toanswer some objections which may
have suggested themselves tothereader.
We start from thepoint atwhich we leftoff—
thespring customs ofEuropean peasantry. Besides
theceremonies already described there aretwo kin-
dred setsofobservances inwhich thesimulated death
ofadivine orsupernatural being isaleading feature.
These observances arecommonly known as"Burying
theCarnival," and "Driving orcarrying outDeath."
Both customs arechiefly practised, oratleast best
known, onGerman andSlavonic ground. Theformer
custom isobserved onthe lastdayoftheCarnival,
namely. Shrove Tuesday [Fastiiac/d), oronthe first
dayofLent, namely, AshWednesday. The latter
custom iscommonly observed ontheFourth Sunday
inLent, which hence getsthename ofDead Sunday
(Todteitsonntag);butinsome places itisobserved a
week earlier;inothers again, asamongst theCzechs
ofBohemia, aweek later. Originally thedateofthe
celebration ofthe''Carrying outDeath"appears not
tohave been fixed, buttohavedepended ontheap-
pearance ofthe firstswallow orofsome other natural
phenomenon.^ ABohemian form ofthecustom of
"Burying theCarnival"hasbeen already described.-
The following Swabian form isobviously similar.
Intheneighbourhood ofTubingen onShrove Tues-
dayastraw-man, called theShrovetide Bear, ismade
up ;he isdressed inapair ofoldtrousers, anda

fresh black-pudding ortwosquirts filled withblood are
inserted inhisneck. After aformal condemnation he
isbeheaded, laid inacoffin, andonAshWednesday
isburied inthechurchyard. This iscalled "Burying
theCarnival" i^'dic Fastnacht vergrabeji ").^Amongst
some oftheSaxons ofTransylvania theCarnival is
hung. Thus atBraller onAshWednesday orShrove
Tuesday twowhite andtwochestnut horses draw a
sledge onwhich isplaced astraw-man swathed ina
white cloth;beside him isacart-wheel which iskept
turning round. Two ladsdisguised asoldmen follow
thesledge lamenting. The restofthevillage lads,
mounted onhorseback anddecked with ribbons, accom-
pany theprocession, which isheaded bytwo girls
crowned with evero-reen anddrawn inawagfo-on or
sledge. Atrial isheldunder atree, atwhich lads
disguised assoldiers pronounce sentence ofdeath.
Thetwooldmen trytorescue thestraw-man andto
flywith him, buttonopurpose;he iscaught bythe
twomrlsandhanded over totheexecutioner, whohanofs

and atlast indespair theythrow themselves onthe
ground andweep andhowl forthehanged man.An
official thenmakes aspeech inwhich hedeclares
that theCarnival wascondemned todeath because
hehaddone them harm, bywearing out their
shoes andmaking them tired and sleepy." Atthe

After theprocession theFool was buried under

straw amid loud lamentation.^ InWurmlingen the
Fool isrepresented byayoung fellow enveloped in

Weingarten onAshWednesday theFool, represented
byastraw-man, iscarried about andthenthrown into
thewater totheaccompaniment ofmelancholy music.
Inother villages ofSwabia thepartoffool isplayed
byaliveperson, who isthrown into thewater after
being carried about inprocession.^ AtBalwe, in
Westphalia, astraw-man ismade onShrove Tuesday
andthrown into theriver amid rejoicings. This is
called, asusual, "Burying theCarnival."'^ Onthe

Joud cries ofjoy,andfastened tothetopofatree in

tionagainst allkinds ofmisfortune.^ Sometimes the
resurrection ofthepretended dead person isenacted.
Thus, insome parts ofSwabia, onShrove Tuesday
Dr.Iron-Beard professes tobleed asickman,who
thereupon falls asdead totheground;butthedoctor
atlast restores him tolifebyblowing airintohim

long claypipes which aredistributed atfunerals. On
themorning ofShrove Tuesday inthefollowing year
thebrandy isdugupandthefestival begins byevery
onetasting thebrandy which, asthephrase goes, has
come tolifeagain.^
Theceremony of"Carrying outDeath"presents
much thesame features as"Burying theCarnival;"
except that thefigure ofDeath isoftener drowned
orburned than buried, and that thecarrying outof
Death isgenerally followed byaceremony, oratleast
accompanied byaprofession, ofbringing inSummer,
Spring, orLife. Thus, insome villages ofThiiringen
ontheFourth Sunday ofLent, thechildren used to

Theyoung people make upafigure ofstraw orthe

Inother parts ofBohemia they carry Death tothe
endofthevillage, singing—
"Wecarry Death outofthevillage,
And theNewYear intothevillage.
Dear Spring, webidyouwelcome,
Green grass, webidyouwelcome."
Behind thevillage they erect apyre, onwhich they
burn thestraw figure, reviling and scoffing at itthe
while. Then they return, singing—
"Wehave carried away Death,
Andbrought Lifeback.
Hehastaken uphisquarters inthevillage.
Therefore singjoyous songs."^
AtNurnberg, girls ofseven toeighteen years of
age, dressed intheir best, carry through thestreets

fastened toitforahead, inanopen box. They sing,
"We carry Death intothewater, itiswell," or,"We
carry Death into thewater, carry him inand out
again."-
The effigy ofDeath isoften regarded with fear
andtreated withmarks ofhatred andcontempt. In
Lusatia thefigure issometimes made tolook inatthe
window ofahouse, and itisbelieved thatsome one
inthehouse will diewithin theyear unless his life
isredeemed bythepayment ofmoney.^ Again, after
throwing theeffigy away, thebearers sometimes run

he isobliged tocarry theDeath back tothevillage.
The effigy isthen burned.^ Ontheother hand itis

been driven issometimes supposed tobeprotected
against sickness and plague.^ Insome villages of
Austrian Silesia ontheSaturday before Dead Sunday
aneffigy ismade ofoldclothes, hay,and straw, for
thepurpose ofdriving Death outofthevillage. On
Sunday thepeople, armed with sticks and straps,
assemble before thehouse where thefigure islodged.
Four ladsthendraw theeffigy bycords through the
village amid exultant shouts, while alltheothers beat
itwith their sticks and straps. Onreaching afield
which belongs toaneighbouring village they laydown
thefigure, cudgel itsoundly, andscatter thefragments
over the field. The people believe that thevillage
fromwhich Death hasbeen thus carried out willbe

straw, isflung intoapool orswamp with thewords,
"The devil take thee."-
Thecustom of"sawing theOldWoman," which is
orused tobeobserved inItalyandSpain ontheFourth
Sunday inLent, isdoubtless, asGrimm supposes,
merely another form ofthecustom of"carrying out
Death." Agreat hideous figure representing theoldest
woman ofthevillage wasdragged outandsawn in
two,amid aprodigious noisemade with cow-bells, pots
andpans, etc.^ InPalermo theceremony used tobe
stillmore realistic. AtMid-Lent anoldwoman was
drawn through thestreets onacart,attended bytwo
men dressed inthecostume oftheConipagnia de
Bianchi, asociety orreligious order whose function it
was toattend andconsole prisoners condemned to
death.Ascaffold waserected inapublic square;the
oldwoman mounted it,andtwomock executioners
proceeded, amid astorm ofhuzzas andhand-clapping,
tosawthrough herneck orrather through abladder
ofblood which hadbeen previously fitted toherneck.
Theblood gushed outandtheoldwoman pretended
toswoon and die.The lastofthesemock executions
took place in1737.^ AtFlorence, during thefifteenth
andsixteenth centuries, theOldWoman was repre-
sented byafigure stufi"ed with walnuts anddried figs
andfastened tothetopofaladder. AtMid-Lent this
effigy wassawn through themiddle under theLoggie
oftheMercato Nuovo, andasthedried fruits tumbled

white ribbons, andmarch inprocession with their
Lito(Summer) into the village, collecting giftsand
singing—
"We carried Death outofthevillage.
Wearecarrying Summer intothevillage."^
Inmany Silesian villages thefigure ofDeath, after
being treated with respect, isstripped ofitsclothes
andflung with curses intothe w^ater, ortorn inpieces

village nearHermanstadt (Transylvania) observe the
ceremony of"carrying outDeath" inthefollowing
manner. After forenoon church alltheschool-girls
repair tothehouse ofone oftheir number, and
there dress uptheDeath. This isdone bytying a
threshed-out corn-sheaf intotherough semblance ofa
head andbody, while thearms aresimulated bya
broomstick stuck horizontally. The figure isdressed
intheSunday clothes ofavillage matron. Itisthen
displayed atthewindow that allpeople maysee iton
theirway toafternoon church. Assoon asvespers
areover thegirls seize theeffigy and,singing ahymn,
carry itinprocession round the village. Boys are
excluded from theprocession. After theprocession
hastraversed thevillage fromendtoend,thefigure is
taken toanother house andstripped ofitsattire ;the
naked straw bundle isthenthrown outofthewindow
totheboys,who carry itoffand fling itinto the
nearest stream. This isthe first actofthedrama.

thefigure ofDeath, and, like it,isledinprocession
round thevillage tothesinging ofthesamehymns
asbefore. The ceremony ends with afeast at
thehouse ofthe girlwho acted thechief part ;as
before, theboys areexcluded. "According topopular
belief, itisallowed toeat fruit only after this day, as

village where itiscustomary, such neglect issupposed
toentail death tooneoftheyoung people, orlossof
virtue toagirl."^
Inthe firstofthese twoceremonies thetreewhich
isbrouQfht home after thedestruction ofthe fio^ure of
Death isplainly equivalent tothetrees orbranches
which, inthepreceding customs, were brought back
asrepresentatives ofSummer orLife, afterDeath had
beenthrown away ordestroyed. Butthetransference
oftheshirtworn bytheeffigy ofDeath tothetree
clearly indicates that thetree isakind ofrevivifica-
tion, inanew form, ofthedestroyed effigy.^ This
comes out also intheTransylvanian custom ;the
dressing ofagirlintheclothes wornbytheDeath, and
theleading herabout thevillage tothesame songs
which hadbeensungwhen theDeath wasbeing carried
about, show thatshe isintended tobeakind ofre-
suscitation ofthebeing whose effigy hasjustbeen
destroyed. These examples therefore suggest thatthe
Death whose demolition isrepresented inthese cere-
monies cannot beregarded asthepurely destructive
agent which weunderstand byDeath. Ifthetree
which isbrought back asanembodiment ofthereviv-
ingvegetation ofspring isclothed intheshirtwornby
theDeath which hasbeen just destroyed, theobject
certainly cannot betocheck andcounteract therevival
ofvegetation ;itcanonlybetofoster andpromote it.
Therefore thebeing which hasjustbeen destroyed—
theso-called Death—must besupposed tobeendowed
with avivifying andquickening influence, which itcan
communicate tothevegetable andeven theanimal
world. This ascription ofalife-giving virtue tothe

figure ofDeath isputbeyond adoubt bythecustom,
observed insome places, oftaking pieces ofthestraw
effigy ofDeath andplacing them inthefields tomake
thecrops grow, orinthemanger tomake the cattle
thrive. Thus inSpachendorf (Austrian Silesia) the
figure ofDeath made ofstraw, brushwood, andrags,
iscarried outwith wildsongs toanopen place outside
thevillage andthere burned, andwhile itisburning a
general struggle takes place forthepieces, which are
pulled outoftheflames withbare hands. Each one
whosecures afragment oftheeffigy ties ittoabranch
ofthelargest tree inhisgarden, orburies itinhis
field, inthebelief that thiscauses thecrops togrow
better.^ IntheTroppau district (Austrian Silesia) the
straw figure which theboysmake ontheFourth
Sunday inLent isdressed bythe girls inwoman's
clothes andhung with ribbons, necklace, andgarlands.
Attached toalong pole itiscarried outofthevillage,
followed byatroop ofyoung people ofboth sexes,
who alternately frolic, lament, andsingsongs. Arrived
atitsdestination—afield outside the village—the

ifthebearers ofthe figure, after throwing itaway,
meet cattle andstrike them with their sticks, this will

been previously used tobeattheDeath," andsohad
acquired thefertilising power ascribed tothe effigy.
InLeipzig atMid-Lentmen andwomen ofthe
lowest class used tocarry through allthestreets a
straw effigy ofDeath, which they exhibited toyoung
wives, and finally threw into the river, alleging that
thismade young wives fruitful, cleansed the city,
andaverted theplague andother sickness from the
inhabitants forthat year.^
Itseems hardly possible toseparate from the
May- trees the trees orbranches which arebrought
into thevillage after thedestruction oftheDeath.
Thebearers who bring them inprofess tobebring-
ing intheSummer ;^therefore the trees obviously
represent theSummer ;and the dollwhich issome-
times attached totheSummer-tree isaduplicate

sometimes represented atthesame timebyaMay-

trees areadorned likeMay-trees with ribbons, etc.;
likeMay -trees, when large, they areplanted inthe
ground andclimbed up;and likeMay -trees, when
small, they arecarried from door todoorbyboys or

and theMay/ The customs, therefore, ofbringing
intheMayandbringing intheSummer areessentially
thesame; and theSummer-tree ismerely another
form oftheMay -tree, theonly distinction (besides
that ofname) being inthetime atwhich they are
respectively brought in ;forwhile theMay-tree is
usually fetched inonthe istofMay oratWhit-
suntide, theSummer-tree isfetched inontheFourth
Sunday inLent. Therefore, iftheexplanation here
adopted oftheMay-tree (namely, that itisanembodi-
ment ofthe tree-spirit orspirit ofvegetation) is
correct, theSummer-tree must likewise beanembodi-
ment ofthe tree-spirit orspirit ofvegetation. But
wehave seen that theSummer-tree isinsome cases
arevivification ofthe effigy ofDeath. Itfollows,
therefore, that inthese cases theeffigy called Death
must beanembodiment ofthetree-spirit orspirit of
vegetation. This inference isconfirmed, first, by
thevivifying and fertilising influence which thefrag-
ments oftheeffigy ofDeath arebelieved toexercise
both onvegetable andonanimal life;forthis in-
fluence, aswesaw inthe first chapter, issupposed
tobeaspecial attribute ofthe tree -spirit. Itis
confirmed, secondly, byobserving that the effigy of

theexpulsion ofDeath andthebringing inofSummer
as,insome cases atleast, merely another form ofthat
death and resuscitation ofthe spirit ofvegetation

resurrection oftheWild Man.^ The burial and
resurrection oftheCarnival isprobably another way
ofexpressing thesame idea. The burying ofthe
representative oftheCarnival under adung-heap
isnatural, ifhe issupposed topossess aquickening
and fertilising influence like that ascribed tothe
effigy ofDeath. BytheEsthonians, indeed, thestraw
figure which iscarried outofthevillage intheusual
wayonShrove Tuesday isnotcalled theCarnival,
buttheWood-spirit [Ilfetsik), and theidentity ofit
with thewood-spirit isfurther shown byfixing it
tothetopofatree inthewood, where itremains

and offerings toprotect theherds;forlikeatrue

Death, andSummer, arecomparatively lateand in-
adequate expressions forthebeings personified or

abstractness ofthenames bespeaks amodern origin;
the personification oftimes and seasons like the

which byagradual process ofgeneralisation thewider

But thisgeneral conception ofvegetation would readily
beconfounded with theseason inwhich itmanifests

May forthetree-spirit orspirit ofvegetation would
beeasyand natural. Again theconcrete notion of
thedying tree ordying vegetation would byasimilar
process ofgeneralisation glide intoanotion ofdeath
ingeneral ;sothatinstead ofthecarrying outofthe
dying ordead vegetation inspring (asapreliminary
toitsrevival) weshould intime getacarrying out

monies Death meant originally thedying ordead
vegetation ofwinter hasthehigh support ofW.

272 KOSTRUBONKO
The supposition thatbehind theconceptions of
Death, Carnival, Summer, etc., asembodied in
these spring ceremonies, there lurk older andmore
concrete notions istoacertain extent countenanced
bythe fact that inRussia funeral ceremonies like
those of"Burying theCarnival" and "Carrying
outDeath "arecelebrated under thenames, not
ofDeath ortheCarnival, butofcertain mythic
figures, Kostrubonko, Kostroma, Kupalo, Lada, and
Yarilo. These Russian ceremonies areobserved both
inspring and atmidsummer. Thus "inLittle Russia
itused tobethecustom atEastertide tocelebrate the
funeral ofabeing called Kostrubonko, thedeity ofthe
spring. Acircle wasformed ofsingers whomoved

until thegirlsuddenly sprang up,onwhich thechorus

There theybathed her inthewater, while theoldest
girlmade abasket oflime-tree barkandbeat itlikea
drum. Then they returned tothevillage andended
thedaywith processions, games, anddances.' Inthe
Murom district, Kostroma wasrepresented byastraw

into itthe figure waslowered amid weeping and

These Russian customs areplainly ofthesame
nature asthose which inAustria andGermany are
known as"Burying theCarnival" and"Carrying out

isright, theRussian Kostroma, Yarilo, etc.must also
have been originally embodiments ofthe spirit of
vegetation, and their death must have been regarded
asanecessary preliminary totheir revival. The
revival asasequel tothedeath isenacted inthe
first oftheceremonies described, thedeath and
resurrection ofKostrubonko. The reason why in
some ofthese Russian ceremonies thedeath ofthe

bethat thedecHne ofsummer isdated from Mid-
summer Day, after which thedays begin toshorten,
andthesunsetsoutonhisdownward journey—
"Tothedarksome hollows
Where thefrosts ofwinter lie."
Such aturning-point oftheyear,when vegetation
might bethought toshare theincipient though still
almost imperceptible decay ofsummer, might very
wellbechosen byprimitive man asafitmoment for
resorting tothose magic ceremonies bywhich he
hopes tostay thedecline, oratleast toensure the
revival, ofplant life.
Butwhile thedeath ofvegetation appears tohave
been represented inall,and itsrevival insome, ofthese
spring andmidsummer ceremonies, there arefeatures
insome ofthem which canhardly beexplained on
thishypothesis alone. Thesolemn funeral, thelamen-
tations, andthemourning attire, which often characterise
these ceremonies, areindeed appropriate atthedeath
ofthebeneficent spirit ofvegetation. Butwhat shall

haps beexplained byabelief that there isacertain
infectiousness inthedead spirit ofvegetation which
renders itsapproach dangerous. But thisexplanation,
besides being rather strained, does notcover there-
joicings which often attend thecarrying outofDeath.

Wemust therefore recognise two distinct andseem-
ingly opposite features inthese ceremonies ;onthe
onehand, sorrow forthedeath, andaffection andrespect
forthedead;ontheother hand, fearandhatred ofthe
dead, andrejoicings athisdeath. How theformer of
these features istobeexplained Ihave attempted
toshow; howthelattercame tobesoclosely associated
with theformer isaquestion which Ishall trytoanswer
inthesequel.
Before wequit these European customs togo
farther afield, itwillbewell tonotice that occasionally
theexpulsion ofDeath orofamythic being iscon-
ducted without anyvisible representative oftheper-
sonage expelled. Thus atKonigshain, near Gorlitz
(Silesia), allthevillagers, young and old,used togo
outwith straw torches tothetopofaneighbouring
hill, called Todtcnstein (Death-stone), where they lit
their torches, andsoreturned home singing, "We
have driven outDeath, we are bringing back
Summer."^ InAlbania young people light torches of
resinous wood onEaster Eve,andmarch inproces-
sionthrough thevillage brandishing them. Atlast
theythrow thetorches into the river, saying, "Ha,
Kore,weflingyou into the river, likethese torches,
thatyoumay return nomore." Some saythat the
intention oftheceremony istodrive outwinter;but
Kore isconceived asamalignant beingwhodevours
children.-
IntheKanagra district, India, there isacustom
observed byyoung girls inspring which closely
resembles some oftheEuropean spring ceremonies
just described. Itiscalled theRaliKameld, or

fairofRali, theRali being asmall painted earthen
image ofSiva orParvati. Itlasts through most
ofChet (March-April) uptotheSankrant ofBai-
sakh (April), and isinvogue allover theKanagra
district. Itscelebration isentirely confined toyoung
girls. Onamorning inMarch alltheyoung girls
ofthevillage take small baskets ofd/tbgrass and
flowers toacertain fixed spot,where theythrow them
inaheap. Round thisheap theystand inacircle and
sing. This goes onevery day fortendays, tillthe
heap ofgrass andflowers hasreached afairheight.
Then they cutinthejungle twobranches having three
prongs atoneend,andplace them, prongs downwards,
over theheap offlowers, soastomake twotripods or
pyramids. Onthesingle uppermost points ofthese
branches they getanimage -maker toconstruct two
clay images, one torepresent Siva, and theother
Parvati. The girls then divide themselves intotwo
parties, one forSivaandone forParvati, andmarry
theimages intheusual way, leaving outnopartofthe
ceremony. After themarriage theyhave afeast, the
cost ofwhich isdefrayed bycontributions solicited
from their parents. Then atthenext Sankrant
(Baisakh) they allgotogether totheriverside, throw
theimages intoadeep pool,andweep over theplace,
asthough they were performing funeral obsequies.
Theboys oftheneighbourhood often annoy them by
diving after theimages, bringing them up,andwaving
them about while thegirls arecrying overthem. The
object ofthe fair issaid tobetosecure agood

Parvati areconceived asspirits ofvegetation seems to

beproved bythe factthat their images areplaced on
branches over aheap ofgrass andflowers. Here, as
often inEuropean folk-custom, thedivinities ofvege-
tation arerepresented induplicate, byplants andby
puppets. The marriage ofthese Indian deities in
spring corresponds totheEuropean ceremonies in
which themarriage ofthevernal spirits ofvegetation
isrepresented bytheKing andQueen ofMay, the
May Bride, Bridegroom oftheMay, etc.^Thethrow-
ingoftheimages intothewater, andthemourning for
them, aretheequivalents oftheEuropean customs of
throwing thedead spirit ofvegetation (under thename
ofDeath, Yarilo, Kostroma, etc.) intothewater and
lamenting over it.Again, inIndia, asoften in
Europe, the rite isperformed exclusively byfemales.
The notion that theceremony was effective forpro-
curing husbands tothegirls canbeexplained bythe
quickening and fertilising influence which the spirit of
vegetation isbelieved toexert upon human and
animal, aswell asupon vegetable life.-

But itisinEgypt andWestern Asia that the
death andresurrection ofvegetation appear tohave
beenmost widely celebrated withceremonies likethose
ofmodern Europe. Under thenames ofOsiris,
Adonis, Thammuz, Attis, andDionysus, theEgyp-
tians, Syrians, Babylonians, Phrygians, andGreeks
represented thedecay and revival ofvegetation with
rites which, astheancients themselves recognised,

were substantially thesame, andwhich find their
parallels inthespring andmidsummer customs ofour
European peasantry. Thenature andworship ofthese
deities havebeen discussed atlength bymany learned
writers;allthat Ipropose todo istosketch those
salient features intheir ritual andlegends which seem
toestablish theview heretaken oftheir nature. We
begin withAdonis orThammuz.
The worship ofAdonis was practised bythe
Semitic peoples ofSyria, fromwhom itwasborrowed
bytheGreeks asearly atleast asthe fifth century
before Christ. Thename Adonis isthePhoenician
Adon, "lord."^ Hewas said tohave been afair
youth, beloved byAphrodite (the Semitic Astarte),
butslainbyaboar inhisyouthful prime. Hisdeath
wasannually lamented with abitter wailing, chiefly
bywomen ;images ofhim, dressed toresemble
corpses, were carried outastoburial andthenthrown
intotheseaorintosprings;-and insome places his
revival was celebrated onthefollowing day.^ But
theceremonies varied somewhat both inthemanner
andtheseason oftheir celebration indifferent places.
AtAlexandria images ofAdonis andAphrodite were
displayed ontwocouches ;beside them were setripe
fruits ofallkinds, cakes, plants growing inflower pots,
andgreen bowers twined with anise. Themarriage
ofthelovers wascelebrated oneday,andonthenext
theimage ofAdonis wasborne bywomen attired as
mourners, with streaming hairandbared breasts, to

thesea-shore andcommitted tothewaves. ^The
date atwhich thisAlexandrian ceremony wasobserved
isnotexpressly stated;butfrom themention ofthe
ripe fruits ithasbeen inferred that ittook place in
latesummer.- AtByblus thedeath ofAdonis was
annually mourned with weeping, wailing, andbeating
ofthebreast;butnextdayhewasbelieved tocome
tolifeagain andascend uptoheaven inthepresence
ofhisworshippers.^ This celebration appears tohave
taken place inspring;foritsdatewasdetermined by
thediscoloration oftheriver Adonis, and thishas
beenobserved bymodern travellers tooccur inspring.
Atthatseason theredearth washed down from the
mountains bytherain tinges thewater oftheriver
andeven theseaforagreatwaywith ablood -red
hue,andthecrimson stain was believed tobethe
blood ofAdonis, annually wounded todeath bythe
boaronMount Lebanon.^ Again, theredanemone'^
was said tohave sprung from theblood ofAdonis;
andastheanemone blooms inSyria about Easter, this
isafresh proof thatthefestival ofAdonis, oratleast
oneofhisfestivals, wascelebrated inspring. The
name oftheflower isprobably derived fromNaaman
("darling"), which seems tohave been anepithet of
Adonis. TheArabs still calltheanemone "wounds
oftheNaaman.""

Theresemblance ofthese ceremonies totheIndian
andEuropean ceremonies previously described is
obvious. Inparticular, apart from thesomewhat
doubtful date ofitscelebration, theAlexandrian cere-
mony isalmost identical with theIndian. Inboth
ofthem themarriage oftwo divinities, whose con-
nection with vegetation seems indicated bythefresh
plants withwhich they aresurrounded, iscelebrated
ineffigy, andtheeffigies areafterwards mourned over
andthrown intothewater.^ From thesimilarity of
these customs toeach other andtothespring andmid-
summer customs ofmodern Europe weshould naturally
expect thatthey alladmit ofacommon explanation.
Hence, iftheexplanation hereadopted ofthe latter
iscorrect, theceremony ofthedeath andresurrection
ofAdonis must alsohave been arepresentation of
thedecay and revival ofvegetation. The inference
thusbased onthesimilarity ofthecustoms iscon-
firmed bythefollowing features inthelegend and
ritual ofAdonis. Hisconnection with vegetation
comes outatonce inthecommon story ofhisbirth.
Hewas said tohave been born from amyrrh-tree,
thebark ofwhich bursting, after atenmonths' gesta-
tion, allowed thelovely infant tocome forth. Accord-
ingtosome, aboar rent thebark with histuskand
soopened apassage forthebabe.Afaint ration-
alistic colour wasgiven tothelegend bysaying that
hismother was awoman named Myrrh, whohad
been turned into amyrrh -tree soon after shehad
conceived the child. ^Again thestory thatAdonis

allybysupposing that herepresented vegetation,
especially the corn, which liesburied intheearth
half theyear and reappears above ground the
other half. Certainly oftheannual phenomena of
nature there isnone which suggests soobviously
theidea ofayearly death and resurrection asthe
disappearance and reappearance ofvegetation in
autumn and spring. Adonis hasbeen taken forthe
sun;butthere isnothing inthesun's annual course
within thetemperate and tropical zones tosuggest
thathe isdead forhalf orathird oftheyearand
alive fortheother half ortwo-thirds. Hemight,
indeed, beconceived asweakened inwinter,- but

appearance contradicts thesupposition. Within the
arctic circle, where thesunannually disappears fora
continuous period offrom twenty -four hours tosix
months, according tothe latitude, hisannual death
and resurrection would certainly beanobvious idea;
butnoonehassuggested that theAdonis worship
came from those regions. Ontheother hand the

Butperhaps thebest proof thatAdonis was a
deity ofvegetation isfurnished bythegardens of
Adonis, astheywere called. These were baskets or
pots filled with earth, inwhich wheat, barley, lettuces,
fennel, andvarious kinds offlowers were sown and
tended foreight days, chiefly orexclusively bywomen.

ofthedead Adonis, and flung withthem intothesea

observed atmidsummer. Forweknow thatthefleet

These gardens ofAdonis aremost naturally inter-
preted asrepresentatives ofAdonis ormanifestations
ofhispower;they represented him, true tohisori-
ginal nature, invegetable form, while theimages of
him,withwhich theywere carried outand cast into
thewater, represented him inhis later anthropo-
morphic form. Allthese Adonis ceremonies, ifI
am right, were originally intended ascharms to
promote thegrowth and revival ofvegetation;and
theprinciple bywhich theywere supposed topro-
duce this effect was sympathetic magic. Aswas
explained inthe firstchapter, primitive people suppose
thatbyrepresenting ormimicking the effect which
they desire toproduce they actually help toproduce
it;thusbysprinkling water theymake rain,bylight-
ingafiretheymake sunshine, andsoon. Similarly
bymimicking thegrowth ofcrops, theyhope toinsure
agood harvest. The rapid growth ofthewheat
andbarley inthegardens ofAdonis wasintended
tomake thecorn shoot up ;and thethrowing of
thegardens andoftheimages into thewater was
acharm tosecure aduesupply offertilising rain.-

corresponding ceremonies ofmodern Europe. We
have seen that thecustom ofdrenching aleaf-clad
person (who undoubtedly personifies vegetation) with
water isstillresorted toinEurope fortheexpress
purpose ofproducing rain/ Similarly thecustom of
throwing water onthe lastcorn cutatharvest, oron
theperson who brings ithome (acustom observed in
Germany andFrance, and tillquite lately inEngland
and Scotland), isinsome places practised with the
avowed intent toprocure rainforthenext year's crops.

andsowers retorted byseizing every one,throwing them

Prussia, theperson whowore awreath made ofthe

was uttered that"as thecorn hadsprung upand

calexplanation ofaBabylonian festival resembling
theSyrian festival ofAdonis. Atthis festival, which
doubtless took place inthemonth Thammuz (June-
July)*andtherefore about midsummer, thedeadTham-
muzwasprobably represented ineffigy, water was
poured over him,andhecame tolifeagain. This
Babylonian legend is,therefore, ofimportance, since
itconfirms theview that thepurpose forwhich

thewater was toeffect theresurrection ofthegod, that

is,tosecure therevival ofvegetation. Theconnection
ofThammuz withvegetation isproved byafragment
ofaBabylonian hymn, inwhichThammuz isdescribed
asdwelling inthemidst ofagreat tree atthecentre of
theearth.^
The opinion that thegardens ofAdonis are
essentially charms topromote thegrowth ofvege-
tation, especially ofthecrops, and thattheybelong
tothesame class ofcustoms asthose spring and
midsummer folk-customs ofmodern Europe which
have been described, does not rest for itsevidence
merely onthe intrinsic probability ofthe case.
Fortunately, weareable toshow thatgardens of
Adonis (ifwemay usetheexpression inageneral
sense) are still planted, first,byaprimitive race at
their sowing season, and, second, byEuropean
peasants atmidsummer. Amongst theOraons and
Mundas ofBengal, when thetimecomes forplanting-
outthe ricewhich hasbeengrown inseed-beds, a
party ofyoung people ofboth sexes gototheforest
and cutayoung Karma tree, orthebranch ofone.
Bearing itintriumph they return dancing, singing.
andbeating drums, andplant itinthemiddle ofthe

tree ;andnext morning theyouth ofboth sexes,
linked arm-in-arm, dance inagreat circle round the
Karma tree,which isdecked with strips ofcoloured
clothandsham bracelets andnecklets ofplaited straw.
Asapreparation forthe festival, thedaughters ofthe
head-man ofthevillage cultivate blades ofbarley ina
peculiar way. Theseed issown inmoist, sandy soil,
mixed with turmeric, andtheblades sprout andunfold

the festival thegirls takeupthese blades andcarry
them inbaskets tothedancing-ground, where, pros-
trating themselves reverentially, they place some of
theplants before theKarma tree. Finally, theKarma
tree istaken away andthrown into astream or
tank/ Themeaning ofplanting these barley blades
andthenpresenting them totheKarma tree ishardly
open toquestion. Wehave seen that trees are
supposed toexercise aquickening influence upon the
growth ofcrops, and thatamongst thevery people in
question—theMundas orMundaris—"the grove
deities areheldresponsible forthecrops."-Therefore,
when attheseason forplanting outthe rice the
Mundas bring inatreeand treat itwith somuch
respect, their object canonlybetofoster thereby the
growth ofthericewhich isabout tobeplanted out;
and thecustom ofcausing barley blades tosprout
rapidly andthen presenting them tothetreemust
beintended tosubserve thesame purpose, perhaps
byreminding thetree- spirit ofhisduty towards the
crops, and stimulating hisactivity by this visible
example ofrapid vegetable growth. Thethrowing of
theKarma tree into thewater istobeinterpreted
asarain-charm. Whether thebarley blades are
alsothrown into thewater isnotsaid ;but, ifmy
interpretation ofthecustom isright, probably they
are so.Adistinction between thisBengal custom
andtheGreek rites ofAdonis isthat intheformer the
tree-spirit appears inhisoriginal form asatree;
whereas intheAdonis worship heappears inanthro-
pomorphic form, represented asadead man, though
hisvegetable nature isindicated bythegardens of

InSardinia thegardens ofAdonis are stillplanted
inconnection with thegreatmidsummer festival which
bears thename ofSt.John. AttheendofMarch
oronthe istofApril ayoung man ofthevillage
presents himself toagirlandaskshertobehisco^nare

The invitation isconsidered asanhonour bythegirl's
family, and isgladly accepted. Attheend ofMay
thegirlmakes apotofthebark ofthecork-tree, fills it
with earth, andsows ahandful ofwheat andbarley init.
Thepotbeing placed inthesunandoften watered, the
corn sprouts rapidly andhasagood head byMid-
summer Eve (St.John's Eve, 23dJune). The pot is
then called Erine orNeimeri. OnSt.John's Daythe
young man and the girl, dressed intheir best,
accompanied byalong retinue andpreceded by
children gambolling andfrolicking, move inprocession
toachurch outside thevillage. Here they break the
potbythrowing itagainst thedoor ofthechurch.
Then they sitdown inaringonthegrass and eat
eggsandherbs tothemusic offlutes. Wine ismixed
inacupandpassed round, each onedrinking as it
passes. Then they joinhands andsing "Sweethearts
ofSt.John" {Compare ecoma^-e diSan Giovaimi)
over andover again, the flutes playing thewhile.
When they tireofsinging, they stand upanddance
gaily inaring tillevening. This isthegeneral
Sardinian custom. Aspractised atOzieri ithassome
special features. InMay thepots aremade ofcork-
bark and planted with corn, asalready described.
Then ontheEve ofSt.John thewindow-sills are
draped with rich cloths, onwhich thepots areplaced,

adorned with crimson andblue silkandribbons of
various colours. Oneach ofthepots they used
formerly toplace astatuette orcloth dolldressed as
awoman, oraPriapus-like figure made ofpaste;but
thiscustom, rigorously forbidden bytheChurch, has
fallen into disuse. The village swains goabout in
atroop tolook atthepotsand their decorations and
towait forthegirls,whoassemble onthepublic square
tocelebrate the festival. Here agreat bonfire is
kindled, round which they dance andmake merry.
Those whowish tobe"Sweethearts ofSt.John" act
asfollows. Theyoung man stands ononesideofthe
bonfire and the girlonthe other, and they, ina
manner, joinhands byeachgrasping oneendofalong
stick, which they pass three times backwards and
forwards across the fire, thus thrusting their hands
thrice rapidly into the flames. This seals their
relationship toeach other. Dancing andmusic go
on tilllate atnight.^ Thecorrespondence ofthese
Sardinian potsofgrain tothegardens ofAdonis seems
complete, and theimages formerly placed inthem
answer totheimages ofAdonis which accompanied
hisgardens.
This Sardinian custom isoneofthosemidsummer
customs, once celebrated inmany parts ofEurope,

ently prove theconnection ofthemidsummer bonfire
withvegetation;forboth inSweden andBohemia an
essential part ofthe festival istheraising ofaMay-
pole orMidsummer-tree, which inBohemia isburned
inthe bonfire. Again, intheRussian midsummer
ceremony cited above,^ thestraw figure ofKupalo,
therepresentative ofvegetation, isplaced beside a
May -pole orMidsummer -treeandthen carried to
and froacross abonfire, Kupalo ishererepresented

and inanthropomorphic formbythestraw effigy, just
asAdonis wasrepresented bothbyanimage anda
garden ofAdonis;andtheduplicate representatives
ofKupalo, likethose ofAdonis, are finally cast into
water. IntheSardinian custom theGossips or
Sweethearts ofSt.John probably correspond tothe
LordandLady orKing andQueen ofMay. Inthe
province ofBlekinge (Sweden), partofthemidsummer
festival istheelection ofaMidsummer Bride, who
chooses herbridegroom;acollection ismade forthe
pair,who forthetimebeing arelooked upon asman
and wife." SuchMidsummer pairs areprobably, like
theMay pairs, representatives ofthespirit ofvegeta-
tion initsreproductive capacity ;they represent in
fleshandblood what theimages ofSivaandParvati
intheIndian ceremony, andtheimages ofAdonis and
Aphrodite intheAlexandrian ceremony, represented
ineffigy. The reason whyceremonies whose aim is
tofoster thegrowth ofvegetation should thus be
associated with bonfires ;why inparticular the re-
presentative ofvegetation should beburned intree-
form orpassed across the fireineffigy orintheform

Itisenough tohaveproved thefactofsuch association
andtherefore tohave obviated theobjection which
might have been raised tomyinterpretation ofthe
Sardinian custom, ontheground that thebonfires
have nothing todowith vegetation. Onemore piece
ofevidence mayherebegiven toprove thecontrary.
Insome parts ofGermany young menand girls leap
overmidsummer bonfires fortheexpress purpose of
making thehemp orflaxgrow tall.^Wemay, there-
fore,assume that intheSardinian custom theblades
ofwheat andbarley which areforced oninpots forthe
midsummer festival, andwhich correspond soclosely
tothegardens ofAdonis, formoneofthose widely-
spread midsummer ceremonies, theoriginal object of
which was topromote thegrowth ofvegetation, and
especially ofthecrops. But as,byaneasyextension
ofideas, thespirit ofvegetation wasbelieved toexercise
abeneficent influence overhuman aswell asanimal
life,thegardens ofAdonis would besupposed, like
theMay-trees orMay-boughs, tobring good luck to
thefamily ortotheindividual who planted them;
andeven after theideahadbeenabandoned thatthey
operated actively tobring good luck,omens might still
bedrawn fromthem astothegood orbadfortune
offamilies orindividuals. Itisthus thatmagic
dwindles into divination. Accordingly wefindmodes
ofdivination practised atmidsummer which resemble
more orlessclosely thegardens ofAdonis. Thus an
anonymous Italian writer ofthesixteenth century has
recorded that itwascustomary tosow barley and
wheat afewdays before the festival ofSt.John
(Midsummer Day)and also before thatofSt.Vitus;
and itwasbelieved thattheperson forwhom theywere

sown would befortunate andgetagoodhusband ora
good wife, ifthegrain sprouted well ;but ifthey
sprouted ill,heorshewould beunlucky.^ Invarious
parts ofItalyand allover Sicily itisstillcustomary to
putplants inwater orinearth ontheEveofSt.John,
andfrom themanner inwhich they arefound tobe
blooming orfading onSt.John's Dayomens are
drawn, especially astofortune inlove. Amongst
theplants used forthispurpose are Cittid diS.
Guivanni (St.John's wort?) and nettles." InPrussia
twohundred years ago thefarmers used tosend
outtheir servants, especially their maids, togather
St.John's wort onMidsummer Eve orMidsummer
Day (St. John's Day). When they had fetched
it,thefarmer took asmany plants asthere were
persons andstuck them inthewall orbetween the
beams ;and itwasthought that theperson whose
plant didnotbloom would soon fallsickordie.The
restoftheplants were tied inabundle, fastened tothe
endofapole,and setupatthegate orwherever the
cornwould bebrought inatthenext harvest. This
bundle was called Ktipole ;theceremony wasknown
asKupole's festival;and atitthefarmer prayed for
agood crop ofhay, etc." This Prussian custom is
particularly notable, inasmuch as itstrongly confirms
theopinion expressed above thatKupalo (doubtless
identical with Kupole) was originally adeity ofvege-
tation.^ ForhereKupalo isrepresented byabundle

ofplants specially associated withmidsummer in
folk-custom;and her influence over vegetation is
plainly signified byplacing herplant-formed repre-
sentative over theplacewhere theharvest isbrought
in,aswell asbytheprayers foragood cropwhich
areuttered ontheoccasion. Afresh argument is
thus supplied insupport oftheconclusion that the
Death, whose analogy toKupalo, Yarilo, etc., has
beenshown, wasoriginally apersonification ofvegeta-
tion,more especially ofvegetation asdying ordead in
winter. Further, myinterpretation ofthegardens of
Adonis isconfirmed byfinding that inthisPrussian
custom theverysame kind ofplants areused toform
thegardens ofAdonis (aswemay callthem) and
theimage ofthe deity. Nothing could set ina
stronger light thetruth oftheview thatthegardens
ofAdonis aremerely another manifestation ofthe
godhimself.
The lastexample ofthegardens ofAdonis which
Ishall cite isthe following. Attheapproach
ofEaster, Sicilian women sow wheat, lentils, and
canary-seed inplates, which arekept inthedarkand
watered every twodays. The plants soon shoot up;
thestalks aretiedtogether with redribbons, andthe
plates containing them areplaced onthesepulchres
which, with effigies ofthedead Christ, aremade up
inRoman Catholic andGreek churches onGood
Friday,^ justasthegardens ofAdonis were placed on
thegrave ofthedead Adonis.^ Thewhole custom—

Thenext ofthose gods, whose supposed death and
resurrection struck suchdeep roots intothereHgious
faithand ritual ofWestern Asia, isAttis. Hewasto
Phrygia what Adonis wastoSyria. Like Adonis, he
appears tohave been agodofvegetation, and his
death and resurrection were annually mourned and
rejoiced over atafestival inspring. Thelegends and
rites ofthetwogods were somuch alike that the
ancients themselves sometimes identified them/ Attis
was said tohave been afairyouth whowasbeloved
bythegreat Phrygian goddess Cybele. Two different
accounts ofhisdeath were current. Accordinor tothe
one,hewas killed byaboar, likeAdonis. According
totheother, hemutilated himself under apine-tree,
anddiedfrom theeffusion ofblood. The latter issaid
tohave been the local story toldbythepeople of
Pessinus, agreat centre ofCybele worship, andthe
whole legend ofwhich itforms apart isstamped with
acharacter ofrudeness andsavagery that speaks
strongly for itsantiquity.^ Butthegenuineness of

notvery fullyknown, buttheir general order appears
tohave been asfollows.^ Atthespring equinox
(22dMarch) apine-tree was cut inthewoods and
brought into thesanctuary ofCybele, where itwas
treated asadivinity. Itwasadorned with woollen
bands andwreaths ofviolets, forviolets were said to
have sprung from theblood ofAttis, asanemones
from theblood ofAdonis;andtheeffigy ofayoung
manwas attached tothemiddle ofthe tree."* On
thesecond day(23d March) the chief ceremony
seems tohave been ablowing oftrumpets.^ The
third day(24th March) wasknown astheDay of
Blood :thehigh priest drew blood from hisarms
andpresented itasanoffering.'' Itwasperhaps
onthisdayornight that themourning forAttis took
place over aneffigy, which wasafterwards solemnly
buried.^ The fourth day (25th March) was the
Festival ofJoy{Hilaria), atwhich theresurrection of
Attiswasprobably celebrated—atleast thecelebration
ofhisresurrection seems tohave followed closely upon

probably have been esteemed asacrilegious partaking
ofthe lifeorofthebruised andbroken body ofthe

From inscriptions itappears thatboth atPessinus
andRome thehigh priest ofCybele was regularly
called Attis.^ Itistherefore areasonable conjecture
thatthehigh priest played thepart ofthelegendary
Attis attheannual festival- Wehave seen thaton
theDayofBlood hedrew blood from hisarms, and
thismayhave been animitation ofthe self-inflicted
death ofAttis under thepine-tree. Itisnotincon-
sistent with thissupposition that Attiswasalsorepre-
sented atthese ceremonies byaneffigy ;forwehave
already hadcases inwhich thedivine being isfirst

Perhaps wemaygoastep farther andconjecture that
thismimic killing ofthepriest (ifitwassuch), accom-
panied byarealeffusion ofhisblood, was inPhrygia,
as ithasbeen elsewhere, asubstitute forahuman
sacrifice which inearlier times was actually offered.
Professor W.M.Ramsay, whose authority on all
questions relating toPhrygia noone will dispute, isof

Osiris
There seem tobesome grounds forbelieving that
Osiris, thegreat godofancient Egypt, wasoneof
those personifications ofvegetation, whose annual
death and resurrection have been celebrated inso
many lands. Butasthechief ofthegods heappears
tohaveabsorbed theattributes ofother deities, sothat
hischaracter and rites present acomplex ofhetero-
geneous elements which, with thescanty evidence at
ourdisposal, itishardly possible tosort out. Itmay
beworth while, however, toputtogether some ofthe
facts which lend support totheview that Osiris
oratleast oneofthedeities outofwhom hewas
compounded wasagod ofvegetation, analogous to
Adonis and Attis.
The outline ofhismyth isasfollows.^ Osiris was

laws,andtaught them toworship thegods. Before his
time theEgyptians hadbeen cannibals. But Isis,the
sister andwifeofOsiris, discovered wheat andbarley
growing wild,andOsiris introduced thecultivation of
these grains amongst hispeople, who forthwith aban-
doned cannibalism andtook kindly toacorn diet.^
Afterwards Osiris travelled over theworld diffusing
theblessings ofcivilisation wherever hewent. Buton
hisreturn hisbrother Set(whom theGreeks called
Typhon), withseventy-two others, plotted against him,
andhaving inveigled him intoabeautifully decorated
coffer, they nailed itdown onhim, soldered itfast
withmolten lead,andflung itintotheNile. Itfloated
down tothesea. Thishappened onthe 17thdayof
themonth Athyr. Isisputonmourning, andwandered
disconsolately upanddown seeking thebody, tillatlast
shefound itatByblus, ontheSyrian coast, whither it
haddrifted with thewaves. Anerica treehadshotup

ofByblus, admiring the finegrowth ofthe tree,had
caused ittobecutdown andconverted intoapillar of

carried itaway with her. Butshe left ittovisither
sonHorus atButus intheDelta, andTyphon found
thecoffer ashewashunting aboarbythelight ofa
fullmoon.- Herecognised thebody ofOsiris, rent it
intofourteen pieces, andscattered them abroad. Isis
sailed upanddown themarshes inapapyrus boat
seeking thefragments, and asshefound each she
buried it.Hence many graves ofOsiris wereshown
inEgypt. Others saidthat Isis leftaneffigy ofOsiris

Osiris might beworshipped inmany places, and to

Afterwards hersonHorus fought against Typhon,
conquered him,andbound him fast. But Isis, to

him go. This angered Horus, andhepulled the
crown from hismother's head;butHermes replaced

headed Osiris ofMemphis wasinvoked. Thesolemn
processions ofpriests which onthisdaywound round
thetemples with allthepomp ofbanners, images, and
sacred emblems, were amongst themost stately
pageants thatancient Egypt could show. Thewhole
festival ended onthei6thofNovember with aspecial
ritecalled theerection ofthe Tatic, Tat,orDed pillar.'
This pillar appears from themonuments tohavebeen

theology, asthebackbone ofOsiris. Itmight very

Plutarch describes astaking place onthethirddayof

alsohave referred totheresurrection. Hesays that

which drinking-water waspoured. Ashout thenwent
upthat Osiris was found. Then some mould was
mixed with water, andoutofthepaste thusformed a
crescent-shaped image was fashioned, which wasthen

The general similarity ofthemyth and ritual of
Osiris tothose ofAdonis andAttis isobvious. Inall
three casesweseeagodwhose untimely andviolent
death ismourned byaloving goddess andannually
celebrated bytheir worshippers. The character of
Osiris asadeity ofvegetation isbrought outbythe
legend thathewasthe first toteachmen theuseof

with ploughing theearth. He issaid also tohave
introduced the cultivation ofthe vine." Inoneof
thechambers dedicated toOsiris inthegreat temple
ofIsis atPhilae thedead body ofOsiris isrepre-
sented with stalks ofcorn springing from it,and a
priest iswatering thestalks from apitcher which he
holds inhishand. Theaccompanying inscription sets
forth that "This istheform ofhimwhom onemay

devise amore graphic wayofrepresenting Osiris as

mysteries ofthegod, theinnermost secret thatwas
only revealed tothe initiated. Inestimating the
mythical character ofOsiris very great weight must
begiven tothismonument. The legend that his
mangled remains were scattered upanddown the
landmaybeamythical way ofexpressing either the
sowing orthewinnowing ofthegrain. The latter
interpretation issupported bythestory that Isisplaced
thesevered limbs ofOsiris onacorn-sieve.^ Orthe
legend maybeareminiscence ofthecustom ofslaying
ahuman victim (probably considered asarepresenta-
tive ofthecorn-spirit) and distributing hisflesh or
scattering hisashes over the fields tofertilise them.
Wehave already seen that inmodern Europe the
figure of"Death"issometimes torn inpieces, andthat
thefragments arethen buried inthe fields tomake
thecrops grow well." Later onweshallmeet with
examples ofhuman victims being treated inthesame
way. With regard totheancient Egyptians, wehave
itontheauthority ofManetho thattheyused toburn
red-haired menandscatter their ashes withwinnowino--o
fans." That thiscustom was not, asmight perhaps
have been supposed, amereway ofwreaking their
spite on foreigners, amongst whom rather than
amongst the native Egyptians red-haired people
would generally befound, appears from the fact that
theoxenwhich were sacrificed had also tobered;a
siilgle black orwhite hairfound onabeast would have
disqualified itforthe sacrifice.* The redhair ofthe
human victims wasthusprobably essential;the fact
thattheywere generally foreigners wasonly accidental.

ACORN-SPIRIT 307
If,as Iconjecture, these human sacrifices were
intended topromote thegrowth ofthecrops—and
thezvinnowing oftheir ashes seems tosupport this
view—red-haired victims were perhaps selected as
best fitted torepresent the spirit ofthegolden grain.
Forwhen agod isrepresented byaliving person, it
isnatural that thehuman representative should be
chosen ontheground ofhissupposed resemblance to
thegod. Hence theancient Mexicans, conceiving
themaize asapersonal being whowent through the
whole course oflifebetween seed-time and harvest,
sacrificed new-born babes when themaize wassown,
older children when ithadsprouted, andsoon till it
was fully ripe,when they sacrificed oldmen.^Aname
forOsiris wasthe"crop" or"harvest";^ and the
ancients sometimes explained himasapersonification
ofthecorn.^
ButOsiris wasnotonlyacorn-spirit ;hewas also
atree-spirit, and thiswasprobably hisoriginal char-
acter;for,aswehave already observed, thecorn-spirit
seems tobeonlyanextension oftheolder tree-spirit.
Hischaracter asatree-spirit wasrepresented very
graphically inaceremony described byFirmicus
Maternus.* Apine-tree was cutdown, thecentre
washollowed out,andwith thewood thusexcavated
animao-e ofOsiris wasmade, which wasthen "buried"

imagine howtheconception ofatreeastenanted bya
personal being could bemore plainly expressed. The
image ofOsiris thusmade waskept forayearand
then burned, exactly aswasdone with theimage of
Attis which was attached tothe pine-tree. The
ceremony ofcutting thetree, asdescribed byFirmicus
Maternus, appears tobealluded tobyPlutarch.^ It
wasprobably the ritual counterpart ofthemythical
discovery ofthebody ofOsiris enclosed intheerica
tree.Wemay conjecture that theerection ofthe
Talu pillar attheclose oftheannual festival ofOsiris-
wasidentical withtheceremony described byFirmicus;
itistobenoted that inthemyth theerica treeformed
apillar intheKing's house. Like thesimilar custom
ofcutting apine-tree andfastening animage toitin
the rites ofAttis, theceremony perhaps belonged to
that class ofcustoms ofwhich thebringing inthe
May-pole isamong themost familiar. Astothe
pine-tree inparticular, atDenderah thetree ofOsiris
isaconifer, andthe coffer containing thebody of
Osiris ishere represented asenclosed within thetree.^

"the many-named," "the thousand-named," and in

fesses candidly that "it isnow impossible totell
precisely towhat natural phenomena thecharacter
ofIsisatfirstreferred."- Mr.Renouf states that Isis
was theDawn,^ butwithout assigning anyreason
whatever forthe identification. There areatleast
some grounds forseeing inheragoddess ofcorn.
According toDiodorus, whose authority appears to
have been theEgyptian historian Manetho, the dis-
covery ofwheat andbarley wasattributed toIsis,and
ather festivals stalks ofthese grains were carried in
procession tocommemorate theboon shehadconferred
onmen. Further, atharvest-time, when theEgyptian
reapers hadcutthe first stalks, they laidthemdown
andbeat their breasts, lamenting and calling upon
Isis.^Amongst theepithets bywhich she isdesignated
ontheinscriptions are"creatress ofthegreen crop,"
"thegreen one,whose greenness islikethegreenness
oftheearth," and "mistress ofbread."'"According to
Brugsch she is"notonlythecreatress ofthefresh ver-
dureofvegetation which covers theearth, but isactually
thegreen corn-field itself, which ispersonified asa

Osiris hasbeen sometimes interpreted asthesun-

distinguished writers inmodern times that afew
words ofreply seem called for. Ifweinquire on
what evidence Osiris hasbeen identified with thesun
orthesun-god, itwillbefound onexamination that
theevidence isminute inquantity anddubious, where
itisnotabsolutely worthless, inquality. The diligent
Jablonski, the firstmodern scholar tocollect andex-
amine thetestimony ofclassical writers onEgyptian
religion, says that itcanbeshown inmany ways that
Osiris isthesun,andthathecould produce acloud of
witnesses toprove it,butthat itisneedless todoso,
since nolearned man isignorant ofthe fact."^ Ofthe
writers whom hecondescends toquote, theonlytwo
whoexpressly identify Osiris withthesunareDiodorus
andMacrobius. Thepassage inDiodorus runs thus:^
"It issaid that theaboriginal inhabitants ofEgypt,
looking uptothesky,andsmitten withaweandwonder
atthenature oftheuniverse, supposed thattherewere
twogods, eternal andprimeval, thesunandthemoon,
ofwhom theynamed thesun Osiris andthemoon
Isis." Even ifDiodorus's authority forthisstatement

little ornoweight canbeattached to it.For itis
plainly aphilosophical, and therefore alate, ex-
planation ofthe firstbeginnings ofEgyptian religion,
reminding usofKant's familiar saying about thestarry
heavens andthemoral lawrather than oftherude
traditions ofaprimitive people. Jablonski's second
authority, Macrobius, isnobetter butrather worse.
ForMacrobius wasthefather ofthat large family of
mythologists who resolve allormost gods into the
sun. According tohimMercury wasthesun,Mars
wasthesun,Janus wasthesun,Saturn wasthesun,
sowas Jupiter, alsoNemesis, likewise Pan, etc.^ It
was, therefore, nearly amatter ofcourse thatheshould
identify Osiris with the sun.- But apart from the
general principle, sofrankly enunciated byProfessor
Maspero, that allthegods arethesun("Comme to2is
lesdieiix, Osiris est lesoleir'),^ Macrobius hasnot
much cause toshow foridentifying Osiris inparticular
with thesun.Heargues that Osiris must bethesun
because aneyewasoneofhissymbols. Thepremise
iscorrect,^ butwhat exactly ithastodowith thecon-
clusion isnotclear. The opinion that Osiris wasthe
sun isalsomentioned, butnotaccepted, byPlutarch,^
and itisreferred tobyFirmicus Maternus.'^
Amongst modern Egyptologists, Lepsius, inidenti-
fying Osiris with thesun,appears torelymainly onthe
passage ofDiodorus already quoted. Butthemonu-
ments, headds, alsoshow "that down toalatetime
Osiris wassometimes conceived asRa. Inthisquality

ThatRawasboth thephysical sunandthesun-god is
ofcourse undisputed ;butwithevery deference forthe
authority ofsogreat ascholar asLepsius, itmaybe
doubted whether such identification canbetaken as
evidence oftheoriginal character ofOsiris. Forthe
religion ofancient Egypt^maybedescribed asacon-
federacy oflocal cults which, while maintaining against
each other acertain measure ofjealous andeven hostile
independence, were yetconstantly subjected tothe
fusing andamalgamating action ofpolitical centralisa-
tionandphilosophical reflection. The history ofthe
religion appears tohave largely consisted ofastruggle
between these opposite forces ortendencies. Onthe
oneside there wastheconservative tendency topre-
serve thelocal cults with alltheir distinctive features,
fresh, sharp, and crisp, astheyhadbeenhanded down
from animmemorial past. Ontheother side there
wastheprogressive tendency, favoured bythegradual
fusion ofthepeople under apowerful central govern-
ment, first todulltheedge ofthese provincial distinc-
tions, and finally tobreak themdown completely and
merge them inasingle national religion. The con-
servative party probably mustered initsranks the
great bulkofthepeople, their prejudices andaffections
being warmly enlisted infavour ofthe local deity,
withwhose temple and rites theyhadbeen familiar
from childhood ;andthepopular aversion tochange,

opposition ofthelocal clergy, whose material interests
would necessarily suffer withanydecay oftheir shrines.
Ontheother hand thekings, whose power andglory
rosewith the political and ecclesiastical consolidation
ofthenation, were thenatural champions ofreligious
unity;and their efforts would beseconded bythe
cultured andreflecting minority, who could hardly fail
tobeshocked bythemany barbarous andrevolting
elements inthe local rites. Asusual insuch cases,
theprocess ofreligious unification appears tohave
been largely effected bydiscovering points ofsimilarity,
realorimaginary, between various local gods, which
werethereupon declared tobeonly different names or
manifestations ofthesame god.
Ofthedeities whothusacted ascentres ofattrac-
tion, absorbing inthemselves amultitude ofminor

fortheunity ofgod, thekingcommanded toerase the
names ofallother gods from themonuments, andto
destroy theirimages. Hisragewasparticularly directed
against thegodAmmon, whose name and likeness
were effaced wherever they were found ;even the
sanctity ofthetombwasviolated inorder todestroy
thememorials ofthehated god. Insome ofthehalls
ofthegreat temples atCarnac, Luxor, and other
places, allthenames ofthegods, with afewchance
exceptions, were scratched out. Innoinscription cut
inthisking's reign wasanygodmentioned save the

because itwascompounded ofAmmon, andtook
instead thename ofChuen-'eten, "gleam ofthesun's

The oldgodswere reinstated intheirrankand privi-

This attempt ofKingAmenhotep IV isonlyan

aswecantrace it.Therefore, tocome back toour
point, inattempting todiscover theoriginal character
ofanyEgyptian god,noweight canbegiven tothe
identification ofhimwith other o^ods, least ofallwith
thesun-god Ra. Farfrom helping tofollow upthe
trail, these identifications only cross andconfuse it.
The best evidence fortheoriginal character ofthe
Egyptian gods istobefound intheir ritual andmyths,
sofarasthese areknown (which unfortunately islittle
enough), and inthefigured representations ofthem on
themonuments. Itisonevidence drawn from these
sources that Irelymainly fortheinterpretation of
Osiris asadeity ofvegetation.
Amongst ayounger generation ofscholars, Tiele is
ofopinion that Osiris isthe sun, because "inthe
hymns, hisaccession tothethrone ofhisfather iscom-
pared totherising ofthesun,and itiseven saidof
him insomany words :'Heglitters onthehorizon, he
sends outraysoflightfrom hisdouble feather andinun-
dates theworld with it,asthesunfrom outthehighest
heaven.' "^Bythesame token Marie Antoinette must
havebeenagoddess ofthemorning star,because Burke
sawheratVersailles "just above thehorizon, decorat-
ingandcheering theelevated sphere shejustbegan to
move in,—glittering likethemorning star, fulloflife,
andsplendour, andjoy." Ifsuchcomparisons prove any-
thing, theyprove thatOsiris wasnotthesun. There
arealways twoterms toacomparison;athing cannot
becompared toitself. ButTiele alsoappeals tothe
monuments. What ishisevidence ?Osiris issome-
times represented byafigure surmounted by"theso-
called Tat pillar, entirely made upofakind ofsuperim-
posed capitals, oneofwhich hasarude facescratched
1Tiele, History oftheEgyptian Religion, p.44.


NOTTHESUN 317
upon it," Tiele isofopinion that thisrude face is"in-
tended, nodoubt, torepresent theshining sun."^ If
every "rude facescratched"istobetaken asasymbol
oftheshining sun,sun -worship willbediscovered
insome unexpected places. But, onthewhole,
Tiele, like Jablonski, prudently keeps tothehigh
ground ofvague generalities, and the result ofhis
occasional descents tothelevel offacts isnotsuch as
toencourage him toprolong hisstay. "Wereweto
come down todetails," hesays, "and toattend to
slight variations, weshould belostinanocean ofsym-
bolism andmysticism."^ This islikeDeOuincey's
attitude towards murder. "General principles Iwill
suggest. Butastoanyparticular case, once for all I
willhave nothing todowith it."There isnohaving
amanwhotakes such loftyground.
Mr.LePageRenouf also considers that Osiris is
the sun,'^andhisposition isstillstronger than Tiele's.
Forwhereas Tiele produces badarguments forhis
view, Mr.Renouf produces none atall,andtherefore
cannot possibly beconfuted.
Theground uponwhich some recent writers seem
chiefly torely fortheidentification ofOsiris with the
sun isthat thestory ofhisdeath fitsbetter with the
solarphenomena than withanyother innature. It
may readily beadmitted that thedailyappearance and
disappearance ofthesunmight very naturally beex-
pressed byamyth ofhisdeath andresurrection;and
writers who regard Osiris asthesunarecareful to
emphasise thefact that itisthediurnal, andnotthe
annual, course ofthesuntowhich theyunderstand the
myth toapply. Mr.Renouf expressly admits thatthe

thetheme ofthelegend, whywas itcelebrated byan

towhich theconception ofdeath andresurrection isas
appHcable astosunset and sunrise, andwhich, asa
matter offacthasbeen soconceived andrepresented
infolk-custom. Thisphenomenon istheannual growth
anddecay ofvegetation. Astrong reason forinter-
preting thedeath ofOsiris asthedecay ofvegetation
rather than asthesunset istobefound inthegeneral
(though notunanimous) voice ofantiquity, which
classed together theworship andmyths ofOsiris,
Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, andDemeter, asreligions of
essentially thesame type.^ Theconsensus ofancient
opinion onthissubject seems toogreat toberejected
asamere fancy. Soclosely didthe rites ofOsiris
resemble those ofAdonis atByblus thatsome ofthe
people ofByblus themselves maintained that itwas
Osiris andnotAdonis whose death wasmourned by
them.- Such aview could certainly nothave been
held ifthe rituals ofthetwogods hadnotbeen so
alike astobealmost indistinguishable. Again, Hero-
dotus found thesimilarity between the rites ofOsiris
andDionysus sogreat, thathethought itimpossible
the latter could have arisen independently ;they
must, hethought, have been recently borrowed, with
slight alterations, bytheGreeks from theEgyptians.^
Again, Plutarch, avery intelligent student ofcompara-
tive religion, insists upon thedetailed resemblance of
therites ofOsiris tothose ofDionysus."^ Wecannot

witnesses onplain matters offactwhich fellunder their
own cognisance. Their explanations oftheworships
itisindeed possible toreject, forthemeaning of
religious cults isoften open toquestion ;butresem-
blances ofritual arematters ofobservation. There-
fore, thosewho explain Osiris asthesunaredriven
tothealternative ofeither dismissing asmistaken

either sideofthis alternative. Toaccept theformer
would betoaffirm thatweknow the rites ofthese
deities better than themenwho practised, oratleast
whowitnessed them. Toaccept thelatter would in-
volve awrenching, clipping, mangling, and distorting
ofmyth and ritual fromwhich evenMacrobius shrank.^
Ontheother hand, theview that theessence ofall
these riteswasthemimic death and revival ofvege-
tation, explains them separately and collectively inan
easyandnatural way,andharmonises with thegeneral
testimony borne byantiquity totheir substantial simi-
larity. The evidence forthus explaining Adonis,

bastard sonofJupiter (Zeus), aCretan king. Going
abroad, Jupiter transferred thethrone andsceptre to
thechild Dionysus, but,knowing that hiswifeJuno
(Hera) cherished ajealous dislike ofthe child, he
entrusted Dionysus tothecare ofguards upon whose
fidelity hebelieved hecould rely. Juno, however,
bribed theguards, andamusing the child with toys
andacunningly-wrought looking-glass luredhim into

Turning from themyth tothe ritual, wefind that
theCretans celebrated abiennial^festival atwhich the
sufferings anddeath ofDionysus were represented in
every detail.'' Where theresurrection formed part
ofthemyth, italsowasenacted atthe rites, ^and it
even appears that ageneral doctrine ofresurrection,
oratleast ofimmortality, was inculcated opthe
worshippers; forPlutarch, writing toconsole hiswife
onthedeath oftheir infant daughter, comforts herwith
thethought oftheimmortality ofthesoulastaught by
tradition andrevealed inthemysteries ofDionysus.-
Adifferent form ofthemyth ofthedeath and re-
surrection ofDionysus isthat hedescended into
Hades tobring uphismother Semele from thedead.^

ofvegetation, who aresupposed topass acertain
portion ofeachyearunderground, naturally come tobe
regarded asgods ofthelower world orofthedead.
Both Dionysus andOsiris were soconceived.^
Afeature inthemythical character ofDionysus,
which atfirstsight appears inconsistent with hisnature
asadeity ofvegetation, isthathewasoften conceived
and represented inanimal shape, especially inthe
form, oratleast with thehorns, ofabull. Thus he
isspoken ofas"cow-born," "bull,""bull-shaped,"
"bull-faced,""bull-browed,""bull-horned," "horn-
bearing," "two-horned," "horned."-^ Hewasbelieved
toappear, atleast occasionally, asabull.'^ Hisimages
were often, asatCyzicus, made inbull shape,'' orwith
bullhorns;
'andhewaspainted with horns.^ Types

viving monuments ofantiquity.^ Ononestatuette he
appears clad inabull's hide, thehead, horns, and
hoofs hanging down behind.- Athisfestivals Dionysus
was believed toappear inbull form. Thewomen
ofElis hailed him asabull,andprayed himtocome
with hisbulls-foot. They sang,"Come here, Dionysus,
tothyholytemple bythesea;come with theGraces
tothytemple, rushing with thy bull's-foot, Ogoodly
bull,Ogoodly bull !"^According tothemyth, itwas
intheshape ofabullthathewastorn topieces bythe
Titans;^ andtheCretans, inrepresenting thesufferings
anddeath ofDionysus, torealive bull topieces with
their teeth. ^Indeed, therendino- anddevourino; of
live bulls andcalves appear tohave been aregular
feature oftheDionysiac rites.*^The practice ofre-
presenting thegod inbullform orwithsome ofthe
features ofabull, thebelief thatheappeared inbull
form tohisworshippers atthesacred rites, andthe
legend that itwas inbullform thathehadbeen torn
inpieces—allthese factstaken together leave noroom
todoubt that inrending anddevouring alive bull at
hisfestival hisworshippers believed that theywere
killing thegod,eating hisflesh,anddrinking hisblood.
Another animal whose formDionysus assumed was
thegoat. One ofhisnames was"Kid."" Tosave

escape thefuryofTyphon, Dionysus wasturned into
agoat." Hence when hisworshippers rent inpieces
aHvegoatanddevoured itraw,^ theymust have
beheved thattheywere eating thebodyandblood of
thegod.
Thiscustom ofkilHng agod inanimal form, which
weshallexamine more fully presently, belongs toa
very early stage inhuman culture, and isaptinlater
times tobemisunderstood. Theadvance ofthought
tends tostrip theoldanimal andplant gods oftheir
bestial andvegetable husk, and toleave theirhuman
attributes (which arealways thekernel oftheconcep-
tion) asthefinalandsoleresiduum. Inother words,
animal andplant gods tend tobecome purely anthropo-
morphic. When theyhavebecome wholly ornearly
so,theanimals and plants which were atfirst the
deities themselves, still retain avague and ill-under-
stood connection with theanthropomorphic godswhich
havebeendeveloped outofthem. The origin ofthe
relationship between thedeity andtheanimal orplant
having been forgotten, various stories areinvented to
explain it.These explanations may follow oneoftwo
lines according asthey arebased onthehabitual oron
theexceptional treatment ofthesacred animal orplant.
The sacred animal was habitually spared, andonly
exceptionally slain;andaccordingly themyth might
bedevised toexplain eitherwhy itwasspared orwhy

itwas killed. Devised fortheformer purpose, the
myth would tellofsome service rendered tothedeity
bytheanimal ;devised forthe latter purpose, the
myth would tellofsome injury inflicted bytheanimal
onthegod. Thereason given forsacrificing goats to
Dionysus isanexample ofamyth ofthe latter sort.
They were sacrificed tohim, itwas said, because
they injured the vine.^ Now thegoat, aswehave
seen,was originally anembodiment ofthegodhim-
self. Butwhen thegodhaddivested himself ofhis
animal character andhadbecome essentially anthro-
pomorphic, the killing ofthegoat inhisworship
came toberegarded nolonger asaslaying ofthegod
himself, butasasacrifice tohim;and sincesome
reason had tobeassigned whythegoat inparticular
should besacrificed, itwas alleged that thiswas
apunishment inflicted onthegoat forinjuring the
vine, theobject ofthegod's especial care. Thuswe
have thestrange spectacle ofagod sacrificed tohim-
selfontheground thatheishisownenemy. And as
thegod Issupposed topartake ofthevictim offered to
him, itfollows that,when thevictim isthegod's old
self, thegod eats ofhisown flesh. Hence the
goat-god Dionysus isrepresented aseating rawgoat's
blood ;-andthebull-god Dionysus iscalled "eater of
bulls."^Ontheanalogy ofthese instances wemay
conjecture thatwherever agod isdescribed asthe
eater ofaparticular animal, theanimal inquestion was
originally nothing butthegod himself.^

All this,however, does notexplain whyadeity of
vegetation should appear inanimal form. Butthe
consideration ofthispoint hadbetter bedeferred till
wehave discussed thecharacter and attributes of
Demeter. Meantime itremains topoint outthat in
some places, instead ofananimal, ahuman being was
torn inpieces atthe rites ofDionysus. Thiswasthe
custom inChios andTenedos ;^and atPotniae in
Boeotia thetradition ranthat ithadbeen formerly the
custom tosacrifice tothegoat-smiting Dionysus a
child, forwhom agoatwasafterwards substituted.-
AtOrchomenus thehuman victim wastaken from the
women ofacertain family, called theOleiae. Atthe
annual festival thepriest ofDionysus pursued these
women with adrawn sword, and ifheovertook oneof
them hehadaright toslay her. This rightwasex-
ercised aslateasPlutarch's time.^ Astheslain bull
orgoat represented theslain god, so,wemaysuppose,
thehuman victim alsorepresented him. Itispossible,
however, thatatradition ofhuman sacrifice maysome-
times have been amere misinterpretation ofasacrifi-
cial ritual inwhich ananimal victim was treated asa
human being. Forexample, atTenedos thenew-born

330 DEMETER
§8.—
Denicter' andProserpine
TheGreek myth ofDemeter andProserpine is
substantially identical with theSyrian myth ofAphro-
dite (Astarte) andAdonis, thePhrygian myth of
Cybele and Attis, andtheEgyptian myth of Isisand
Osiris. IntheGreek myth, asinitsAsiatic and
Egyptian counterparts, agoddess—Demeter—mourns
thelossofaloved one—Proserpine—who personifies
thevegetation, more especially thecorn, which dies
insummer^ torevive inspring. But intheGreek
myth theloved and lostone isthedaughter in-
stead ofthehusband orlover ofthegoddess ;and
themother aswell asthedaughter isagoddess
ofthe corn." Thus, asmodern scholars have
recognised,^ Demeter and Proserpine aremerely a
mythical reduplication ofthesame natural pheno-
menon. Proserpine, sorantheGreek myth,'* was
gathering flowers when theearth gaped, and Pluto,
lordoftheDead, issuing from theabyss, carried her
offonhisgolden cartobehisbride inthegloomy

Sunherdaughter's fate,shesuffered nottheseed to
grow, butkept ithidden intheground, sothat the
whole raceofmenwould have died ofhunger ifZeus
hadnotsentandfetched Proserpine from thenether
world. Finally itwasagreed that Proserpine should
spend athird, oraccording toothers ahalf,^ ofeach
yearwith Pluto underground, butshould come forth in
spring todwell with hermother andthegods inthe
upper world. Herannual death andresurrection, that
is,herannual descent into theunder world andher
ascension from it,appear tohave been represented in
her rites.^
With regard tothename Demeter, ithasbeen
plausibly argued byMannhardt^ that the first partof
theword isderived from dcai, aCretan word for
"barley";^andthatthusDemeter means theBarley-
mother ortheCorn-mother ;fortherootoftheword
appears tohave been applied todifferent kinds of
grain bydifferent branches oftheAryans, andeven
oftheGreeks themselves.^ AsCrete appears to
have been oneofthemost ancient seats ofthewor-

should beofCretan origin. This explanation of

332 THECORN-MOTHER chap.
frommodern European folk-lore, and ofwhich the
following arespecimens. InGermany thecorn is
verycommonly personified under thename ofthe
Corn-mother. Thus inspring, when thewind sets
thecorn inwave-like motion, thepeasants say,"There
comes theCorn-mother," or"The Corn-mother is
running over the field," or"TheCorn-mother isgoing
through thecorn."^When children wish togointo
the fields topull theblue corn-flowers orthered
poppies, they aretoldnottodoso,because theCorn-
mother issitting inthecornand willcatch them.^ Or
again she iscalled, according tothecrop, theRye-
mother orthePea-mother, andchildren arewarned
against straying intheryeoramong thepeasby
threats oftheRye-mother orthePea-mother. InNor-
way alsothePea-mother issaid tositamong thepeas.^
Similar expressions arecurrent among theSlavs. The
Poles andCzechs warn children against theCorn-
mother who sitsinthecorn. Orthey callhertheOld
Corn-woman, andsaythat she sits inthecornand
strangles the children who tread itdown.* The
Lithuanians say,"The OldRye-woman sits inthe
corn."^Again theCorn-mother isbelieved tomake
thecropgrow. Thus intheneighbourhood ofMagde-
burg itissometimes said, "Itwillbeagood year for
flax;theFlax-mother hasbeen seen." AtDinkelsbtihl
(Bavaria) down tofifteen ortwenty years ago,people
believed thatwhen thecrops onaparticular farmcom-
pared unfavourably with those oftheneighbourhood,
thereason wasthattheCorn-mother hadpunished the
farmer forhis sins.*^ Inavillage ofStyria itis

inwhite, maybeseen atmidnight inthe corn-fields,
which she fertilises bypassing through them;but if
she isangry with afarmer, shewithers up allhis
corn.^
Further, theCorn-mother plays animportant part in
harvest customs. She isbelieved tobepresent inthe
handful ofcornwhich isleftstanding lastontheheld;
andwith thecutting ofthis lasthandful she iscaught,
ordriven away, orkilled. Inthe firstofthese cases,
thelastsheaf iscarried joyfully home andhonoured as
adivine being. Itisplaced inthe barn, and at
threshing thecorn-spirit appears again. ^Inthe
district ofHadeln (Hanover) thereapers stand round
thelastsheaf andbeat itwith sticks inorder todrive
theCorn-mother out of it.They call toeach
other,"There she is !hither !Take careshedoesn't
catch you !"The beating goes on tillthegrain is
completely threshed out;then theCorn-mother is
believed tobedriven away.'^ Intheneighbourhood
ofDanzig theperson who cuts the lastears ofcorn
makes them intoadoll,which iscalled theCorn-mother
ortheOldWoman, and isbrought home onthe last
waggon.^ Insome parts ofHolstein the lastsheaf is
dressed inwoman's clothes andcalled theCorn-mother.
Itiscarried home onthe lastwaggon, andthen
thoroughly drenched with water. Thedrenching with
water isdoubtless arain-charm.^ Inthe district of

fifty-five years. The finest ears areplucked outofit

byscattering theseed taken from herbody (forthe

Galicia, thewreath made outofthe last stalks is
called theWheat-mother, Rye-mother, orPea-mother.
Itisplaced onagirl'shead andkept tillspring, when
some ofthegrain ismixed with theseed-corn.^ Here
again the fertilising power oftheCorn-mother is
indicated. InFrance, also, intheneighbourhood of
Auxerre, the lastsheaf goes bythename ofthe
Mother oftheWheat, Mother oftheBarley, Mother of
theRye, orMother oftheOats. Itisleftstanding

with clothes belonging tothefarmer, andadorned
with acrown andablue orwhite scarf.Abranch

isnow called theCeres. Atthedance intheevening
theCeres isplaced inthemiddle ofthefloor, andthe
reaper who reaped fastest dances round itwith the
prettiest girlforhispartner. After thedance apyre is
made. Allthegirls, each wearing awreath, strip the
puppet, pull ittopieces, andplace itonthepyre, along
with theflowers with which itwasadorned. Then
the girlwhowas the first tofinish reaping sets fire

hasremained intact, though thename Ceres isabitof

Sometimes the lastsheaf iscalled, nottheCorn-

Intheprovince ofOsnabriick (Hanover) itiscalled the
Harvest-mother ;itismade upinfemale form, and
then thereapers dance about with it.Insome parts

Sometimes again the last sheaf iscalled the
Grandmother, and isadorned with flowers, ribbons,
andawoman's apron. InEast Prussia, attherye
orwheat harvest, thereapers callouttothewoman
who binds the last sheaf, "You aregetting theOld

Oftener the lastsheaf iscalled theOldWoman
ortheOldMan. InGermany itisoften shaped and

Swabia when allthecorn ofafarm hasbeen cut
except asingle strip, allthereapers stand inarow
before thestrip;each cuts hisshare rapidly, andhe
whogives thelastcut"hastheOldWoman. "^When

thickest ofallthesheaves, isjeered atbytherest,who
singouttohim,"He hastheOldWoman andmust

issometimes herself called theOldWoman, and it
issaid thatshewillbemarried inthenext year.'^ In
Neusaass, West Prussia, both the lastsheaf—which is
dressed upinjacket, hatandribbons—andthewoman
who binds itarecalled theOldWoman. Together
they arebrought home onthe lastwaggon andare
drenched with water.*' AtHornkampe, nearTiegen-
hof(West Prussia), when aman orwoman lagsbehind
the rest inbinding thecorn, theother reapers dress
upthe lastsheaf intheform ofaman orwoman,
and this figure goesbythelaggard's name, as"the

338 THEOLDWOMAN chap.
Inthese customs, asMannhardt hasremarked, the
person who iscalled bythesame name asthe last
sheaf and sitsbeside itonthelastwaggon isobviously
identified with it;heorsherepresents thecorn-spirit
which hasbeen caught inthe last sheaf; inother
words, thecorn-spirit isrepresented induplicate, bya
human being andbyasheaf.^ The identification of
theperson with thesheaf ismade stillclearer bythe
custom ofwrapping upinthe lastsheaf theperson
who cuts orbinds it.Thus atHermsdorf inSilesia
itused tobetheregular custom totieupinthelast
sheaf thewoman whohadbound it.-AtWeiden in
Bavaria itisthecutter, notthebinder, ofthelastsheaf
who istiedupinit.^Here theperson wrapt upin
thecorn represents thecorn-spirit, exactly asaperson
wrapt inbranches orleaves represents thetree-spirit.*
The last sheaf, designated astheOldWoman, is
often distinguished from theother sheaves byitssize
andweight. Thus insome villages ofWest Prussia
theOldWoman ismade twice aslongandthick asa
common sheaf, andastone isfastened inthemiddle of
it.Sometimes itismade soheavy thataman can
barely lift it.^Sometimes eight orninesheaves aretied
together tomake theOldWoman, andthemanwho
sets itupcomplains ofitsweight.*' AtItzgrund, in
Saxe-Coburg, the lastsheaf, called theOldWoman,
ismade large with theexpress intention ofthereby
securing agood cropnext year.^ Thus thecustom of
making the lastsheaf unusually large orheavy isa
charm, working bysympathetic magic, tosecure a
largeandheavy crop inthefollowing year.

ATHARVEST 339
InDenmark alsothelastsheaf ismade larger than
theothers, and iscalled theOldRye-woman ortheOld
Barley-woman. Noonelikes tobind it,because who-
ever does sowill, itisbelieved, marry anoldman or
anoldwoman. Sometimes thelastwheat-sheaf, called
theOldWheat-woman, ismade upinhuman shape,
with head, arms, and legs, isdressed inclothes and
carried home onthelastwaggon, theharvesters sitting
beside it,drinking andhuzzaing.^ Oftheperson who
binds thelastsheaf itissaid, "She (orhe) istheOld
Rye-woman.""
InScotland, when the lastcorn was cut after
Hallowmas, thefemale figure made outof itwas
sometimes called theCarlin orCarline, i.e.theOld
Woman. But ifcutbefore Hallowmas, itwascalled
theMaiden ;ifcut after sunset, itwas called the
Witch, being supposed tobring bad luck,=^We shall
return totheMaiden presently. InCounty Antrim,
down toafewyears ago,when thesickle was finally
expelled bythereaping machine, thefewstalks ofcorn
leftstanding lastonthe fieldwere plaited together;
then thereapers, blindfolded, threw their sickles atthe
plaited corn, andwhoever happened tocut itthrough
took ithome withhimandput itover hisdoor. This
bunch ofcornwas called theCarley^—probably the
sameword asCarlin.
Similar customs areobserved bySlavonic peoples.
Thus inPoland thelastsheaf iscommonly called the
Baba, that is,theOldWoman."Inthe last sheaf,"
itissaid, "sits theBaba." The sheaf Itself isalso
called theBaba, and issometimes composed oftwelve

Bohemia theBaba,made outofthelastsheaf, hasthe
figure ofawoman with agreat straw hat. Itiscarried
home onthelastharvest-waggon and delivered, along
with agarland, tothefarmer bytwo girls. Inbinding
thesheaves thewomen strive not tobe last, for
shewho binds the lastsheaf willhave achild next
year." The lastsheaf istiedupwith others into a
large bundle, andagreen branch isstuck onthetop
ofit.3Sometimes theharvesters callouttothewoman
whobinds thelastsheaf,"ShehastheBaba," or"She
istheBaba." Shehasthen tomake apuppet, some-
times infemale, sometimes inmale form, outofthe
corn;thepuppet isoccasionally dressed with clothes,
often with flowers andribbons only. The cutter of
the last stalks, aswell asthebinder ofthe last sheaf,
wasalso called Baba;andadoll, called theHarvest-
woman, wasmade outofthe lastsheaf andadorned
with ribbons. The oldest reaper had todance, first
with this doll,andthen with thefarmer's wife.'* In
the district ofCracow, when aman binds the last
sheaf, they say,"The Grandfather issitting init;"
when awoman binds it,they say,"TheBaba issitting
init,"andthewoman herself iswrapt upinthesheaf,
sothatonlyherhead projects outofit.Thus encased
inthesheaf, she iscarried onthelastharvest-waggon
tothehouse, where she isdrenched withwater bythe
whole family. Sheremains inthesheaf tillthedance

InLithuania thename forthe lastsheaf isBoba
(OldWoman), answering tothePolish name Baba.

sheaf—theBoba—ismade intotheform ofawoman,
carried solemnly through thevillage onthelastharvest-

thenevery onedances with it.^
InRussia alsothelastsheaf isoften shaped and
dressed asawoman, andcarried withdance andsong

make adollwhich they calltheCorn-queen orCorn-
mother ;itisdressed inawoman's shirt, carried round

secure plenty ofrainanddew forthenext year's crop.
Or itisburned andtheashes strewn onthe fields,

applied tothelast sheaf, has itsanalogies inNorthern
Europe. ThusBrand quotes fromHutchinson's History
ofNortJmmberland thefollowing :"Ihave seen, in
some places, animage apparelled ingreat finery,
crowned with flowers, asheaf ofcorn placed under

other symbols ofCeres, carried inawaggon, withgreat
pomp andloud shouts, through thestreets, thehorses
being covered withwhite sheets;andwhen Iinquired
themeaning oftheceremony, wasanswered bythe
people, thattheyweredrawing theHarvest Queen."^
Often thecustoms wehave been examining are
practised, notontheharvest field, butonthethreshing-
floor. The spirit ofthecorn, fleeing before thereapers
asthey cutdown thecorn, quits thecutcornandtakes
refuge inthebarn, where itappears inthe lastsheaf
threshed, either toperish under theblows ofthe flail
ortofleethence tothe stillunthreshed corn ofaneigh-
bouring farm.'- Thus the lastcorn tobethreshed is
called theMother-corn ortheOldWoman. Some-
times theperson who gives the laststroke with the
flail iscalled theOldWoman, and iswrapt inthe
straw ofthe last sheaf, orhasabundle ofstraw
fastened onhisback. Whether wrapt inthestraw or
carrying itonhisback, heiscarted through thevillage
amid general laughter. Insome districts ofBavaria,
Thurinoren, etc.,themanwhothreshes the lastsheaf
issaid tohave theOldWoman ortheOldCorn-
woman;heistiedupinstraw, carried orcarted about
the village, and setdown atlastonthedunghill, or
taken tothethreshing-floor ofaneighbouring farmer
who hasnotfinished histhreshing.^ InPoland the
manwho gives the laststroke atthreshing iscalled
Baba (OldWoman) ;heiswrapt incornandwheeled
through thevillage.^ Sometimes inLithuania thelast
sheaf isnotthreshed, but isfashioned into female

shape andcarried tothebarn ofaneighbour whohas
notfinished histhreshing.^ Insome parts ofSweden,
when astranger woman appears onthethreshing-
floor, aflail isputround herbody, stalks ofcorn are
wound round herneck, acrown ofears isplaced on
herhead, and thethreshers call out,"Behold the
Corn-woman." Here the stranger woman, thus
suddenly appearing, istaken tobethecorn-spirit who
hasjustbeen expelled bythe flails from thecorn-
stalks." Inother cases thefarmer's wife represents
thecorn -spirit. Thus intheCommune ofSaligne,
Canton dePoiret (Vendee), thefarmer's wife, along
with the last sheaf, istiedupinasheet, placed ona
litter, and carried tothethreshing machine, under
which she isshoved. Then thewoman isdrawn out
andthesheaf isthreshed byitself, butthewoman is
tossed inthesheet (inimitation ofwinnowing).^ It
would beimpossible toexpress more clearly theidenti-
fication ofthewoman with thecorn thanbythis
graphic imitation ofthreshing andwinnowing her.
Inthese customs the spirit ofthe ripe corn is
regarded asold,oratleast asofmature age. Hence
thenames ofMother, Grandmother, OldWoman, etc.
But inother cases thecorn-spirit isconceived asyoung,
sometimes asachildwho isseparated from itsmother
bythestroke ofthesickle. This lastview appears in
thePolish custom ofcalling outtothemanwho cuts
the lasthandful ofcorn,"You have cutthenavel-
string." ^Insome districts ofWest Prussia thefigure
made outofthelastsheaf iscalled theBastard, andaboy
iswrapt upin it.Thewoman whobinds thelastsheaf

theceremony ofcutting theMaiden atBalquhidder in
September 1888.^ Onsome farms ontheGareloch,
Dumbartonshire, about sixty years agothelasthand-
fulofstanding cornwas called theMaiden. Itwas
divided intwo, plaited, andthen cutwith thesickle by
agirl,who, itwasthought, would belucky andwould
soon bemarried. When itwas cutthereapers
gathered together andthrew their sickles inthe air.
TheMaiden wasdressed with ribbons andhung inthe
kitchen near the roof,where itwaskept forseveral
years with thedate attached. Sometimes fiveorsix
Maidens might beseen hanging atonce onhooks.
The harvest supper was called theKirn." Inother
farms ontheGareloch the lasthandful ofcornwas
called theMaidenhead ortheHead;itwas neatly
plaited, sometimes decked with ribbons, andhung in
thekitchen forayear,when thegrain wasgiven to
thepoultry.^ IntheNorth ofScodand, theMaiden
iskept tillChristmas morning, andthen divided

Ill CUSTOMS COMPARED 347
theMaiden, itmust becutbytheyoungest girl.^
Here theageofthepersonal representative ofthe
corn-spirit corresponds with thatofthesupposed age
ofthecorn-spirit, justasthehuman victims offered by
theMexicans topromote thegrowth ofthemaize
varied withtheageofthemaize.' For intheMexican,
asintheEuropean, custom thehuman beings were
probably representatives ofthecorn-spirit rather than
victims offered tohim. (2.)Again, thesame fertilising
influence which thetree-spirit issupposed toexert over
vegetation, cattle, andevenwomen^isascribed tothe
corn-spirit. Thus, itssupposed influence onvegeta-
tion isshown bythepractice oftaking some ofthe
grain ofthelastsheaf (inwhich thecorn-spirit isregu-
larlysupposed tobepresent), andscattering itamong
theyoung corn inspring."* Itsinfluence oncattle is
shown bygiving thestraw ofthe lastsheaf tothe
cattle atChristmas with theexpress intention ofmak-
ingthem thrive.^ Lastly, itsinfluence onwomen is
indicated bythecustom ofdelivering theMother-sheaf,
made into thelikeness ofapregnant woman, tothe
farmer's wife \^bythebelief thatthewoman whobinds
the lastsheaf willhave achild next year ;^perhaps,
too,bytheidea thattheperson whogets itwillmarry
next year.*^
Plainly, therefore, these spring andharvest customs
arebased onthesame ancient modes ofthought, and
form parts ofthesame primitive heathendom, which
wasdoubtless practised byourforefathers long before
thedawn ofhistory, as itispractised tothisdayby

nature directly through aphysical sympathy orresem-
blance between the riteandthe effect which itisthe

Judged bythese tests, thespring andharvest customs
ofourEuropean peasantry deserve torank asprimitive.
Fornospecial class ofpersons andnospecial places

Thesupernatural beings whose existence istaken for

members ofeach class areindistinguishable. For
example, every farm has itsCorn-mother, oritsOld
Woman, oritsMaiden;butevery Corn-mother ismuch
likeevery other Corn-mother, and sowith theOld
Women andMaidens. Lastly, inthese harvest, asin
thespring, customs, the ritual ismagical rather than
propitiatory. This isshown bythrowing theCorn-
mother intotheriver inorder tosecure rainanddew

Ill MOTHER OFTHEMAIZE 351
besome error inthisdescription ofthecustom. Prob-
ably itwasthedressed-up bunch ofmaize, notthe
granary (Pirua), which wasworshipped bythePeru-
vians andregarded astheMother oftheMaize. This
isconfirmed bywhatweknow ofthePeruvian custom
from another source. The Peruvians, weare told,
believed alluseful plants tobeanimated byadivine
being who causes their growth. According tothe
particular plant, these divine beings were called the
Maize -mother i^Zara-^nama), theOuinoa -mother
(Oitinoa-uiajfia), theCocoa-mother (Coca-mama), and
thePotato -mother iyAxo-mama). Figures ofthese
divine mothers weremade respectively ofears of
maize andleaves ofthequinoa andcocoa plants;they
were dressed inwomen's clothes andworshipped.
Thus theMaize-mother wasrepresented byapuppet
made ofstalks ofmaize, dressed infullfemale attire;
andtheIndians believed that"asmother, ithadthe
power ofproducing andgiving birth tomuch mxaize."^
Probably, therefore, Acosta misunderstood hisinform-
ant,andtheMother oftheMaize which hedescribes
wasnotthegranary (Pirua) butthebunch ofmaize
dressed inrichvestments. ThePeruvian Mother of

astrong confirmation oftheexplanation already given
ofthecustom ofkilling thegod,both periodically and
occasionally. TheMother oftheMaize wasallowed,
asarule, tolivethrough ayear, thatbeing theperiod
during which herstrength might reasonably besup-
posed tolastunimpaired;butonanysymptom ofher
strength failing shewasput todeath andafresh and
vigorous Mother oftheMaize took her place, lest
themaize which depended onher for itsexistence
should languish anddecay.
Hardly lessclearly does thesame train ofthought
come out intheharvest customs formerly observed
bytheZapotecs ofMexico. Atharvest the priests,
attended bythenobles andpeople, went inprocession
tothemaize fields, where theypicked outthelargest
and finest sheaf. This theytook with great ceremony
tothetown orvillage, andplaced itinthetemple upon
analtaradorned with wild flowers. After sacrificing
totheharvest god, thepriests carefully wrapt upthe
sheaf infinelinenandkept ittillseed-time. Then the
priests andnobles metagain atthetemple, oneofthem
bringing theskin ofawild beast, elaborately orna-
mented, inwhich thelinen cloth containing thesheaf
wasenveloped. The sheaf wasthen carried once
more inprocession tothefieldfromwhich ithadbeen
taken. Here asmall cavity orsubterranean chamber
hadbeen prepared, inwhich theprecious sheaf was
deposited, wrapt in itsvarious envelopes. After
sacrifice hadbeen offered tothegods ofthefields for
anabundant crop, thechamber wasclosed andcovered
over with earth. Immediately thereafter thesowing
began. Finally, when thetime ofharvest drew near,
theburied sheaf wassolemnly disinterred bythe


Ill THEMOTHER-COTTON 353
priests, who distributed thegrain toallwhoasked for
it.Thepackets ofgrain sodistributed were carefully
preserved astalismans tillthe harvest.^ Inthese
ceremonies, which continued tobeannually celebrated
long after theSpanish conquest, theintention ofkeep-
ingthefinest sheaf buried inthemaize fieldfrom seed-
time toharvest wasundoubtedly toquicken thegrowth
ofthemaize.
InthePunjaub, totheeast oftheJumna, when
thecotton boles besfin toburst, itisusual "toselecto
thelargest plant inthe field,andhaving sprinkled it
with butter-milk and rice-water, itisbound allover
with pieces ofcotton, taken from theother plants of
the field. This selected plant iscalled Sirdar, or
Bhogaldai, i.e.mother-cotton, from bhogla, aname
sometimes given toalarge cotton -pod, and dai(for
daiya) amother, and after salutations aremade to it,
prayers areoffered thattheother plants mayresemble
itintherichness oftheir produce.""-
Ifthereader still feels anydoubts astothe
original meaning oftheharvest customs practised
byourpeasantry, these doubts maybedispelled by
comparing theharvest customs oftheDyaks ofBorneo.
Atharvest theDyaks ofNorthern Borneo have a
special feast, theobject ofwhich is"tosecure thesoul
ofthe rice,which ifnotsodetained, theproduce of
their farms would speedily rotanddecay." Themode
ofsecuring thesoul ofthe ricevaries indifferent
tribes. Sometimes thepriest catches it,intheform
ofafewgrains ofrice, inawhite cloth. Sometimes

timesome ofthissoul ofthe rice isplanted with the
other seeds, "and isthuspropagated andcommuni-
cated."^Thesame need ofsecuring thesoul ofthe
rice, ifthecrop istothrive, iskeenly feltbythe
Karens ofBurma. When arice-field does not
flourish, they suppose that thesoul {kelah) ofthe
rice isinsomewaydetained from the rice. Ifthe

rice."^ Again, theEuropean custom ofrepresenting the
corn-spirit inthedouble form ofbrideandbridegroom^
isparalleled byacustom observed attherice-harvest
inJava. Before thereapers begin tocutthe rice,the
priest orsorcerer picks outanumber ofearsofrice,
which aretied together, smeared with ointment, and
adorned with flowers. Thus decked out,theearsare
called thepadi-pengantht, that is,theRice-bride and
theRice-bridegroom ;theirwedding feast iscelebrated,
andthecutting ofthe ricebegins immediately after-
wards. Later on,when the rice isbeing got in,a
bridal chamber ispartitioned offinthebarn, and
furnished with anew mat, alamp, and allkinds of
toilet articles. Sheaves of rice, torepresent the
wedding guests, areplaced beside theRice -bride
and theRice -brides^room. Not tillthishasbeen
donemay thewhole harvest behoused inthebarn.
And forthe first forty days after the ricehasbeen
housed, noonemay enter thebarn, forfearofdis-
turbing thenewly-wedded pair.^
Compared with theCorn-mother ofGermany and
theharvest Maiden ofBalquhidder, theDemeter and
Proserpine ofGreece are lateproducts ofreligious
growth. But,asAryans, theGreeks must atonetime
oranother have observed harvest customs likethose
which are stillpractised byCelts, Teutons, andSlavs,
andwhich, farbeyond thelimits oftheAryan world,
have been practised bytheIncas ofPeru, theDyaks
ofBorneo, andtheMalays ofJava—asufficient proof
thattheideas onwhich these customs restarenotcon-
fined toanyone race,butnaturally suggest themselves

toalluntutored peoples engaged inagriculture. Itis
probable, therefore, thatDemeter and Proserpine,
those stately andbeautiful figures ofGreek mythology,
grew outofthesame simple beliefs and practices
which stillprevail among ourmodern peasantry, and
that theywere represented byrude dollsmade out
oftheyellow sheaves onmany aharvest -field long
before their breathing images werewrought inbronze
andmarble bythemaster hands ofPhidias andPraxi-
teles.Areminiscence ofthatolden time—ascent, so
tosay,oftheharvest-field —lingered tothelast inthe
tideoftheMaiden {Kore) bywhich Proserpine was
commonly known. Thus iftheprototype ofDemeter
istheCorn-mother ofGermany, theprototype of
Proserpine istheharvest Maiden, which, autumn after
autumn, isstillmade from thelastsheaf ontheBraes
ofBalquhidder. Indeed ifweknew more about the
peasant -farmers ofancient Greece weshould prob-
ably find thateven inclassical times they continued
annually tofashion theirCorn -mothers (Demeters)
andMaidens (Proserpines) outoftheripe cornon

andProserpine whom weknow arethedenizens of

itwas forsuch divinities alone that therefined
writers ofantiquity had eyes ;therude rites per-
formed byrustics amongst thecornwere beneath
their notice. Even ifthey noticed them, they prob-
ably never dreamed ofanyconnection between the
puppet ofcorn-stalks onthesunny stubble-field and
themarble divinity intheshady coolness ofthetemple.

Plutus ("wealth," "abundance") byDemeter ona

Prussian custom ofthemock birth ofachildonthe

mother represents theCorn-mother {Zytniainatka)
;
thepretended child represents theCorn -baby, and
thewhole ceremony isacharm toensure acrop

served both inspring and atharvest, withwhich
thelegend ofthebegetting ofthe child Plutus
isprobably stillmore intimately connected. Their
general purport istoimpart fertility tothe fields by
performing, oratleast mimicking, upon them thepro-
cessofprocreation.^ Another glimpse ofthesavage

andbyaMaiden. Why then didtheGreeks repre-
sentthecornboth asamother andadaughter? In
theBreton custom themother-sheaf —alarge figure
made outofthelastsheaf withasmall corn-doll inside
ofit^clearly represents both theCorn-mother andthe
Corn-daughter, the latter stillunborn.^ Again, inthe
Prussian custom justdescribed, thewoman who plays
thepartofCorn-mother represents theripecorn;the
child appears torepresent next year's corn, whichmay
beregarded, naturally enough, asthechild ofthis
year's corn, since itisfrom theseed ofthis year's
harvest thatnext year's corn will spring. Demeter
would thusbetheripecorn ofthisyear ;Proserpine
theseed-corn taken from itandsown inautumn, to
reappear inspring. The descent ofProserpine into
thelower world would thus beamythical expres-
sion forthesowing oftheseed;herreappearance
inspring^would express thesprouting oftheyoung
corn. Thus theProserpine ofthis yearbecomes
theDemeter ofthe next, and thismay very well
have been the original form ofthemyth. But
when with theadvance ofreligious thought the
corncame tobepersonified, nolonger asabeing
thatwent through thewhole cycle ofbirth, growth,
reproduction, anddeath within ayear, but asan
immortal goddess, consistency requires thatone of
thetwo personifications, themother orthedaughter,
should besacrificed. Butthedouble conception of

deeply rooted inthepopular mind tobeeradicated by
logic, andsoroom had tobefound inthereformed
myth both formother anddaughter. Thiswasdone
byassigning toProserpine theroleofthecornsown in
autumn andsprouting inspring, while Demeter was
lefttoplay thesomewhat vague and ill-defined partof
mother ofthecorn,wholaments itsannual disappear-
anceunderground, and rejoices over itsreappearance
inspring. Thus instead ofaregular succession of
divine beings, each living ayearandthengiving birth
tohersuccessor, thereformed myth exhibits thecon-
ception oftwo divine andimmortal beings, one of
whom annually disappears intoandreappears from the
ground, while theother has little todobuttoweep
andrejoice attheappropriate times.
This explanation ofthedouble personification of
thecorn inGreek myth assumes that both personi-
fications (Demeter and Proserpine) are original.
But ifweassume that theGreek myth started witha
single personification, theafter-growth ofasecond
personification mayperhaps beexplained asfollows.
Onlooking over thepeasant harvest customs which
havebeen passed under review, itmaybenoticed that
they involve two distinct conceptions ofthecorn-
spirit. Forwhereas insome ofthecustoms thecorn-
spirit istreated asimmanent inthecorn, inothers itis
regarded asexternal to it.Thuswhen aparticular
sheaf iscalled bythename ofthecorn -spirit, and
isdressed inclothes and treated with reverence,^
thecorn -spirit isclearly regarded asimmanent in
thecorn. Butwhen thecorn -spirit issaid tomake

thecorngrow bypassing through it,ortoblight the
corn ofthose against whom shehasagrudge/ she
isclearly conceived asquite separate from, though
exercising power over, thecorn. Conceived inthe
latterwaythecorn-spirit isinafairway tobecome a
deity ofthecorn, ifshehasnotbecome soalready.
Ofthese two conceptions, that ofthecorn-spirit as
immanent inthecorn isdoubtless theolder, since the
view ofnature asanimated byindwelling spirits
appears tohave generally preceded theview ofitas
controlled bydeities external to it ;toput itshortly,
animism precedes deism. Intheharvest customs of
ourEuropean peasantry theconception ofthecorn-
spirit asimmanent appears tobetheprevalent one;
theconception of itasexternal occurs rather asan
exception. InGreek mythology, ontheother hand,
Demeter isdistinctly conceived inthe latterway;she
isthedeity ofthecorn rather thanthespiritimmanent
in it.-The process ofthought which seems tobe
chiefly instrumental inproducing thetransition from
theonemode ofconception totheother isanthropo-
morphism, orthegradual investment oftheimmanent
spirits withmore andmore ofthe attributes of
humanity. Asmenemerge from savagery theten-
dency toanthropomorphise orhumanise their divinities
gains strength;andthemore anthropomorphic these
become, thewider isthebreach which severs them
from those natural objects ofwhich theywere atfirst
merely theanimating spirits orsouls. But inthe
progress upwards from savagery, men ofthesame
generation donotmarch abreast;andthough the
anthropomorphic godsmay satisfy thereligious wants

ofmore advanced individuals, themore backward
members ofthecommunity willcling bypreference to
theolder animistic notions. Nowwhen the spirit of
anynatural object (asthecorn) hasbeen invested with
human qualities, detached from theobject, andcon-
verted intoadeity controlling it,theobject itself is,by
thewithdrawal ofitsspirit, leftinanimate, itbecomes,
sotosay,aspiritual vacuum. Butthepopular fancy,
intolerant ofsuch avacuum, inother words, unable to
conceive anything asinanimate, immediately creates a
fresh mythical being, withwhich itpeoples thevacant
object. Thus thesame natural object isnow repre-
sented inmythology bytwoseparate beings;first,by
theoldspiritnow separated from itand raised tothe
rank ofadeity ;second, bythenew spirit, freshly
created bythepopular fancy tosupply theplace
vacated bytheold spirit onitselevation toahigher
sphere. Theproblem formythology now is,having
gottwoseparate personifications ofthesame object,
what todowiththem ?How aretheir relations to
each other tobeadjusted, androom found forboth in
themythological system ?When theoldspirit ornew
deity isconceived ascreating orproducing theobject
inquestion, theproblem iseasily solved. Since the
object isbelieved tobeproduced bytheoldspirit, and
animated bythenew one,the latter, asthesoulofthe
object, must alsoowe itsexistence totheformer;thus
theoldspirit willstand tothenewoneasproducer to
produced, that is(inmythology), asparent tochild,
and ifboth spirits areconceived asfemale, their relation
willbethatofmother anddaughter. Inthisway, start-
ingfrom asingle personification ofthecorn asfemale,
mythology might intimereach adouble personification
ofitasmother anddaughter. Itwould bevery rash

toaffirm that thiswastheway inwhich themyth of
Demeter andProserpine actually took shape;but it
seems alegitimate conjecture thatthereduplication of
deities, ofwhich Demeter andProserpine furnish an
example, maysometimes have arisen intheway indi-
cated. Forexample, among thepairs ofdeitieswhom
wehave been considering, ithasbeenshown that
there aregrounds forregarding both Isisandher
companion god Osiris aspersonifications ofthecorn.^
Onthehypothesis justsuggested, Isiswould bethe
oldcorn -spirit, and Osiris would bethenewer one,
whose relationship tothe old spirit was variously
explained asthat ofbrother, husband, andson;-for
ofcourse mythology would always befree toaccount
forthecoexistence ofthetwodivinities inmoreways
than one. Further, thishypothesis offers atleast a
possible explanation ofthe relation ofVirbius to
theArician Diana. The latter, aswehave seen,^
was atree-goddess ;and if,as Ihave conjectured,
theFlamen Virbialis wasnoother than the priest
ofNemi himself, that is,theKing oftheWood,
Virbius must alsohave been atree-spirit. Onthe
present hypothesis hewas thenewer tree -spirit,
whose relation totheoldtree-spirit (Diana) wasex-
plained byrepresenting him asher favourite or
lover. Itmust not,however, beforgotten that this
proposed explanation ofsuch pairs ofdeities as
Demeter andProserpine, Isisand Osiris, Diana and
Virbius, ispurely conjectural, and isonly given for
what itisworth.

DEATH OFCORN-SPIRIT 363
§9.—
Lityerses
Inthepreceding pages anattempt hasbeenmade
toshow that intheCorn-mother andharvest Maiden of
Northern Europe wehave theprototypes ofDemeter
andProserpine. Butanessential feature isstillwant-
ingtocomplete theresemblance. Aleading incident
intheGreek myth isthedeath and resurrection of
Proserpine;itisthisincident which, coupled with the
nature ofthegoddess asadeity ofvegetation, links
themyth with thecults ofAdonis, Attis, Osiris, and
Dionysus ;and itisinvirtue ofthisincident thatthe
myth isconsidered inthischapter. Itremains, there-
fore, toseewhether theconception oftheannual death
andresurrection ofagod,which figures soprominently
inthese great Greek andOriental worships, hasnot
also itsorigin intherustic ritesobserved byreapers
andvine-dressers amongst thecorn-shocks andthe
vines.
Our general ignorance ofthepopular supersti-
tions andcustoms oftheancients hasalready been
confessed. But the obscurity which thus hangs
over the firstbeginnings ofancient religion isfortun-
ately dissipated tosome extent inthepresent case.
Theworships ofOsiris, Adonis, andAttishadtheir re-
spective seats, aswehave seen, inEgypt, Syria, and
Phrygia;and ineachofthese countries certain harvest
andvintage customs areknown tohavebeen observed,
theresemblance ofwhich toeach other and tothe
national rites struck theancients themselves, and,com-
pared with theharvest customs ofmodern peasants and
barbarians, seem tothrow some lightontheorigin of
therites inquestion.


364 MANEROS
Ithasbeen already mentioned, ontheauthority of
Diodorus, that inancient Egypt thereapers were
wont tolament over the first sheaf cut,invoking
Isisasthegoddess towhom theyowed thediscovery
ofcorn.^ Totheplaintive song orcrysung oruttered
byEgyptian reapers theGreeks gave thename of
Maneros, andexplained thename byastory that
Maneros, theonly sonofthe firstEgyptian king,
invented agriculture, and,dying anuntimely death, was
thuslamented bythepeople.' Itappears, however, that
thename Maneros isduetoamisunderstanding ofthe
{oxm\A?i mcid-ne-hra, "come thou back," which hasbeen
discovered invarious Egyptian writings, forexample
inthedirge ofIsisintheBook oftheDead.^ Hence
wemaysuppose that thecrymdd-ne-hra waschanted
bythereapers over thecutcorn asadirge forthe
death ofthecorn-spirit (Isis orOsiris) andaprayer
for itsreturn. Asthecrywasraised over thefirstears
reaped, itwould seem thatthecorn-spirit wasbelieved
bytheEgyptians tobepresent inthefirstcorn cutand
todieunder the sickle.Wehave seen that inJava
the first earsofricearetaken torepresent theCorn-
bride andtheCorn-bridegroom.^ Inparts ofRussia
the firstsheaf istreated much inthesameway that

InPhoenicia andWestern Asiaaplaintive song, like
thatchanted bytheEgyptian corn-reapers, wassung
atthevintage andprobably (tojudge byanalogy) also
atharvest. This Phoenician songwas called bythe
Greeks Linus orAilinus andexplained, likeManeros,
asalament forthedeath ofayouth named Linus.^
According toonestory Linus wasbrought upbya
shepherd, buttorn topieces byhisdogs.' But, like
Maneros, thename Linus orAilinus appears tohave
originated inaverbal misunderstanding, and tobe
nothing more than thecryailauti, that is"woe tous,"
which thePhoenicians probably uttered inmourning
forAdonis ;^atleastSappho seems tohave regarded
Adonis andLinus asequivalent.-^
InBithynia alikemournful ditty, called Bormus
orBorimus, waschanted byMariandynian reapers.
Bormus was said tohavebeen ahandsome youth, the
sonofKing Upias orofawealthy anddistinguished
man. Onesummer day,watching thereapers atwork
inhis fields, hewent tofetchthem adrink ofwater
andwasnever heard ofmore. Sothereapers sought
forhim, calling him inplaintive strains, which they
continued touseever afterwards.^
InPhrygia thecorresponding song, sung by
harvesters both atreaping and atthreshing, wascalled
Lityerses. According toone story, Lityerses wasa
bastard sonofMidas, King ofPhrygia. Heused to
reap thecorn,andhadanenormous appetite. When

inthecorn-stalks, being afterwards thrown intowater

thathuman beings have beencommonly killed by

Ill WITHHARVEST CUSTOMS 367
willexamine these grounds successively, beginning with
theformer.
Incomparing thestory with theharvest customs
ofEurope,^ three points deserve special attention,
namely :I.thereaping match and thebinding of
persons inthesheaves; 11.the killing ofthecorn-
spirit orhisrepresentatives; III.thetreatment of
visitors totheharvest-field orofstrangers passing it.
I.Inregard tothe first head,wehave seen that
inmodern Europe theperson who cuts orbinds or
threshes thelastsheaf isoften exposed torough treat-
ment atthehands ofhisfellow-labourers. Forexample,
heisbound upinthelast sheaf, and,thus encased, is
carried orcarted about, beaten, drenched with water,
thrown onadunghill, etc. Or, ifhe isspared this
horseplay, he isatleast thesubject ofridicule oris
believed destined tosuffer some misfortune inthe
course ofthe year. Hence the harvesters are
naturally reluctant togive the lastcutatreaping or
the laststroke atthreshing ortobind thelastsheaf,
andtowards theclose ofthework thisreluctance pro-
duces anemulation among thelabourers, each striving
tofinish histask asfastaspossible, inorder thathe
may escape theinvidious distinction ofbeing last."
For example, intheneighbourhood ofDanzig,
when thewinter corn iscutandmostly bound upin
sheaves, theportion which stillremains tobebound is
divided among^st thewomen binders, each ofwhom

reapers, children, and idlers gathers round towitness
thecontest, and attheword, "Seize theOldMan," the

andthewoman whocannot keep pace with therest

OldMan (that is,thelastsheafmade upintheform

withthewords, "Here Ibring youtheOldMan." At
thesupper which follows, theOldMan isplaced atthe
tableandreceives anabundant portion offood which,
ashecannot eat it,falls totheshare ofthewoman who
carried him. Afterwards theOldMan isplaced inthe
yardand allthepeople dance round him.Orthewoman
whobound thelastsheaf dances foragood while with
theOldMan, while therestform aringround them;
afterwards they all,oneafter theother, dance asingle
round withhim. Further, thewoman whobound the
lastsheaf goes herself bythename oftheOldMan till
thenext harvest, and isoftenmocked with the cry,
"Herecomes theOldMan."^AtAschbach, Bavaria,
when thereaping isnearly finished, thereapers say,
"Nowwewilldrive outtheOldMan." Each ofthem

OldMan gets twice aslarge aportion offood asthe

theperson whogives thelaststroke issaid tohave the

These examples illustrate thecontests inreaping,
threshing, andbinding which take place amongst the
harvesters, onaccount oftheir unwillingness tosuffer
theridicule andpersonal inconvenience attaching to
theindividual whohappens tofinish hiswork last.
Itwillberemembered that theperson who islast at
reaping, binding, orthreshing, isregarded asthe
representative ofthecorn -spirit,^ and this idea is
more fully expressed bybinding him orher incorn-
stalks. The latter custom hasbeen already illustrated,
butafewmore instances maybeadded. AtKloxin,
near Stettin, theharvesters callouttothewoman who
binds the last sheaf, "Youhave theOldMan, and
mustkeep him." TheOldMan isagreat bundle of
corndecked with flowers and ribbons, andfashioned
into arude semblance ofthehuman form. Itis
fastened onarake orstrapped onahorse, andbrought
withmusic tothevillage. Indelivering theOldMan
tothefarmer, thewoman says—
"Here, dear Sir, istheOldMan.
Hecanstaynolonger onthe field.
Hecanhidehimself nolonger.
Hemustcome intothevillage.
Ladies andgentlemen, praybesokind
Astogive theOldMan apresent."
Forty orfiftyyears agothecustom was totieup
thewoman herself inpease-straw, andbring herwith
music tothefarmhouse, where theharvesters danced
withher tillthepease-straw felloff^Inother villages

Dingelstedt, inthe district ofErfurt, about fifty
years ago itwas thecustom totieupaman in
the last sheaf. Hewas called theOldMan, and
wasbrought home onthe lastwaggon, amid huzzas
andmusic. Onreaching thefarmyard hewas rolled
round thebarn anddrenched with water.- At
Nordlingen, Bavaria, themanwho gives the last

"In allthese cases theidea isthat the spirit of

II.Passing tothesecond point ofcomparison

customs, wehavenow toseethat inthelatter thecorn-
spirit isoften believed tobekilled atreaping orthresh-
ing. IntheRomsdal andother parts ofNorway, when
thehaymaking isover, thepeople saythat "theOld
Hay-man hasbeen killed." Insome parts ofBavaria
themanwhogives thelaststroke atthreshing issaid
tohave killed theCorn-man, theOats-man, orthe
Wheat-man, according tothecrop." IntheCanton of
Tillot, inLothringen, atthreshing the lastcorn the
menkeep time with their flails, calling outasthey
thresh,"Wearekilling theOldWoman!W'e are
killing theOldWoman!" Ifthere isanoldwoman
inthehouse she iswarned tosave herself, orshe will
bestruck dead.^ InLithuania, near Ragnit, the last
handful ofcorn isleftstanding by itself, with the
words,"TheOldWoman i^Boba) issitting inthere."
Then ayoung reaper whets hisscythe, and, with a
strong sweep, cutsdown thehandful. Itisnow said
ofhimthat"HehascutofftheBoba's head ;"andhe

toanother account, every Lithuanian reaper makes haste
tofinish histask;fortheOldRye-woman Hves inthe
laststalks, andwhoever cutsthelaststalks killstheOld
Rye-woman, andbykilling herhebrings trouble on
himself.'' InWilkischken (district ofTilsit) theman
who cutsthelastcorngoesbythename of"The killer
oftheRye-woman."^ InLithuania, again, thecorn-
spirit isbelieved tobekilled atthreshing aswell asat
reaping. When onlyasingle pileofcornremains tobe
threshed, allthethreshers suddenly stepback afew
paces, asifattheword ofcommand. Then they fall
towork plying their flails with theutmost rapidity
andvehemence, tilltheycome tothe lastbundle.
Upon thisthey fling themselves with almost frantic
fury, straining every nerve, andraining blows on ittill
theword"Halt!"rings outsharply from theleader.
Themanwhose flail isthe last tofall after the
command tostop hasbeen given isimmediately
surrounded byallthe rest,crying outthat "Hehas
struck theOldRye-woman dead." Hehastoexpiate
thedeed bytreating them tobrandy;and, likethe
manwho cuts the last corn, he isknown as"The
killer oftheOldRye-woman."^Sometimes in
Lithuania the slain corn -spirit wasrepresented bya
puppet. Thus afemale figure wasmade out of
corn-stalks, dressed inclothes, and placed onthe
threshing-floor, under theheap ofcornwhich was to
bethreshed last. Whoever thereafter gave the
laststroke atthreshing "struck theOldWoman
dead."^ Wehave already hadexamples ofburning

times, again, thecorn-spirit isrepresented byaman,
who Hesdown under the lastcorn;itisthreshed
upon hisbody, andthepeople saythat "theOld
Man isbeing beaten todeath."^Wehave already
seen that sometimes the farmer's wife isthrust,
together with the last sheaf, under thethreshing-
machine, asiftothresh her,and that afterwards a
pretence ismade ofwinnowing her. "AtVolders,
intheTyrol, husks ofcorn arestuck behind theneck
ofthemanwhogives thelaststroke atthreshing, and
heisthrotded with astraw garland. Ifheistall, itis
believed thatthecorn willbetallnext year. Then he
istiedonabundle andflung intothe river.^ In
Carinthia, thethresher whogave the laststroke, and
theperson whountied thelastsheaf onthethreshing-
floor, arebound hand and footwith straw bands, and
crowns ofstraw areplaced ontheir heads. Then
they are tied, face toface, onasledge, dragged
through the village, andflung into abrook.'* The
custom ofthrowing therepresentative ofthecorn-
spirit intoastream, like that ofdrenching himwith
water, is,asusual, arain-charm.''
III.Thus fartherepresentatives ofthecorn-
spirit have generally been theman orwoman who
cuts, binds, orthreshes thelast corn.Wenowcome
tothecases inwhich thecorn -spirit isrepresented
either byastranger passing theharvest-field (asinthe

Thus, like Lityerses, modern reapers layhold of
apassing stranger and tiehimupinasheaf. Itis
not tobeexpected that they should complete the
parallel bycutting offhishead;but iftheydonot
takesuch astrong step, their language andgestures
are atleast indicative ofadesire todo so.For
instance, inMecklenburg onthe firstdayofreaping, if
themaster ormistress orastranger enters the field, or
merely passes by it,allthemowers facetowards him
andsharpen their scythes, clashing their whet-stones
against them inunison, asiftheyweremaking ready

Near Ratzeburg when themaster orother person of

orwith asilken band;theother dehvers arhyming
address. Thefollowing arespecimens ofthespeeches
made bythereaper onthese occasions. Insome parts
ofPomerania every passer-by isstopped, hisway
being barred with acorn-rope. The reapers form a
circle round himandsharpen their scythes, while their
leader says—
"Themen areready,
Thescythes arebent,
Thecorn isgreatandsmall,
Thegentleman must bemowed."
Then theprocess ofwhetting thescythes isrepeated.^
AtRamin, inthedistrict ofStettin, thestranger, stand-
ingencircled bythereapers, isthusaddressed—
"We'll stroke thegentleman
With ournaked sword.
Wherewith weshearmeadows and fields.
Weshear princes and lords.
Labourers areoften athirst;
Ifthegentleman willstand beerandbrandy
Thejoke willsoonbeover.
But, ifourprayer hedoes not like,

That inthese customs thewhetting ofthescythes
isreally meant asapreliminary tomowing appears
from thefollowing variation ofthepreceding customs.
Inthe district ofLtineburg when anyoneenters the
harvest -field, he isasked whether hewillengage a
good fellow. Ifhesays yes,theharvesters mowsome

accordingly. AtWiedingharde inSchleswig when a
stranger comes tothethreshing-floor he isasked
"Shall Iteach youtheflail-dance.^" Ifhesays yes,
theyputthearms ofthethreshing-flail round hisneck
(as ifhewere asheaf ofcorn), andpressthem together
sotightly thatheisnearly choked/ Insome parishes
ofWermland (Sweden) when astranger enters the
threshing-floor where thethreshers areatwork, they
saythat"they willteach him thethreshing -song."
Then they putaflailround hisneckandastraw rope
about hisbody. Also, aswehave seen, ifastranger
woman enters thethreshing-floor, thethreshers put
aflailround herbody andawreath ofcorn-stalks
round herneck, and callout, "SeetheCorn-woman !
See !that ishow^theCorn-maiden looks !"-
Inthese customs, observed both ontheharvest-
fieldandonthethreshing-floor, apassing stranger is
regarded asapersonification ofthecorn, inother
words, asthecorn -spirit ;andashow ismade of
treating him likethecornbymowing, binding, and
threshing: him. Ifthereader stilldoubts whether
European peasants canreally regard apassing stranger
inthis light, thefollowing custom should settheir
doubts atrest. During themadder- harvest inthe
Dutch province ofZealand astranger passing bya
fieldwhere thepeople aredigging themadder-roots
willsometimes callouttothem Koortspillers (aterm

make after him, and, ifthey catch him, they bring
himback tothemadder-field andburyhim inthe
earth uptohismiddle atleast, jeering athimthe
while;then theyease nature before hisface.^ This
last act istobeexplained asfollows. The spirit
ofthecornandofother cultivated plants issome-
times conceived, notasimmanent inthe plant, but
asitsowner ;hence thecutting ofthecorn atharvest,
thedigging ofthe roots, andthegathering offruit
from thefruit-trees areeach and allofthem acts
ofspoliation, which striphim ofhisproperty and
reduce him topoverty. Hence heisoftenknown as
"thePoorMan"or"thePoorWoman.' Thus inthe
neighbourhood ofEisenach asmall sheaf issometimes
leftstanding onthefield for"thePoorOldWoman."-

38o ROBBING THESPIRIT chap.
AltLest inSilesia themanwhobinds thelastsheaf is
called theBeggar-man.^ Inavillage near Roeskilde,
inZealand (Denmark), old-fashioned peasants some-
timesmake upthelastsheaf intoarude puppet, which
iscalled theRye-beggar.'- InSouthern Schonen the
sheaf which isbound last iscalled theBeggar;it
ismade bigger than therestand issometimes dressed
inclothes. Inthedistrict ofOlmiitz thelastsheaf is
called theBeggar ;itisgiven toanoldwoman, who
must carry ithome, limping onone foot." Thuswhen
thecorn-spirit isconceived asabeing who isrobbed
ofhisstore andimpoverished bytheharvesters, itis
natural that hisrepresentative —thepassing stranger—
should upbraid them;and itisequally natural that
they should seek todisable himfrom pursuing them
andrecapturing thestolen property. Now, itisanold
superstition thatbyeasing nature onthespotwhere a
robbery iscommitted, therobbers secure themselves,
foracertain time, against interruption.^ The fact,
therefore, that themadder -diggers resort tothis
proceeding inpresence ofthestranger proves that
they consider themselves robbers andhim asthe
person robbed. Regarded assuch, hemust bethe
natural owner ofthemadder-roots;that is,their spirit
ordemon;and this conception iscarried outby
burying him, like themadder -roots, intheground.^
The Greeks, itmaybeobserved, were quite familiar
with theidea thatapassing stranger maybeagod.
Homer says thatthegods inthelikeness offoreigners

treated asanembodiment ofthecorn-spirit bybeing
wrapt upinsheaves, killed inmimicry byagricultural
implements, andthrown intothewater.^ These coin-
cidences with theLityerses storyseem toprove that
thelatter isagenuine description ofanoldPhrygian
harvest-custom. Butsince inthemodern parallels the
killing ofthepersonal representative ofthecorn-spirit
isnecessarily omitted oratmost enacted only in
mimicry, itisnecessary toshow that inrude society
human beings havebeencommonly killed asanagri-
cultural ceremony topromote thefertility ofthe fields.
The following examples willmake this plain.
TheIndians ofGuayaquil (Ecuador) used tosacrifice
human blood andthehearts ofmenwhen theysowed

first-fruits oftheseason were offered tothesun, a
criminal was placed between twoimmense stones,
balanced opposite each other, andwascrushed by
them asthey felltogether. Hisremains were buried,
andafeast anddance followed. This sacrifice was
known as"the meeting ofthestones."^ Another
series ofhuman sacrifices offered inMexico tomake

They thought thatanomission ofthis sacrifice would
befollowed bythetotal failure ofthecrops ofmaize,
beans, andpumpkins. The victim was acaptive of
either sex.Hewasclad inthegayest andmost costly
attire, wasfattened onthechoicest food,andcarefully
kept inignorance ofhisdoom. When hewas fat
enough, theybound him toacross inthepresence of
themultitude, danced asolemn dance, then cleft his
head with atomahawk andshothimwith arrows.
According toonetrader, thesquaws then cutpieces of
flesh from thevictim's body, withwhich theygreased
theirhoes;butthiswasdenied byanother trader who
hadbeen present attheceremony. Immediately after
thesacrifice thepeople proceeded toplant their fields.
Aparticular account hasbeen preserved ofthe sacri-
ficeofaSioux girlbythePawnees inApril 1837 or
1838. The girlhadbeen kept forsixmonths and
well treated. Two days before thesacrifice shewas

TheGonds ofIndia, aDravidian race,kidnapped

ficedonvarious occasions. Atsowing andreaping,

But thebestknown case ofhuman sacrifices,
systematically offered toensure good crops, is
supplied bytheKhonds orKandhs, another Dra-
vidian race inBengal. Ourknowledge ofthem
isderived from theaccounts written byBritish
officers who, forty orfifty years ago,were engaged
inputting them down.^ The sacrifices were offered
totheEarth Goddess, TariPennu orBera Pennu,
andwere believed toensure good crops and im-
munity from alldisease and accidents. Inparti-
cular, they were considered necessary inthe culti-
vation ofturmeric, theKhonds arguing that the
turmeric could nothave adeep redcolour without
theshedding ofblood. ^The victim orMeriah
wasacceptable tothegoddess only ifhehadbeen
purchased, orhadbeen born avictim—that is,the
sonofavictim father—orhadbeen devoted asa
child byhisfather orguardian. Khonds indistress
often sold their children forvictims, "considering the
beatification oftheir souls certain, and their death, for
thebenefit ofmankind, themost honourable possible."

Aman ofthePanua tribe wasonce seen toload a
Khond with curses, and finally tospit inhis face,
because theKhond had sold foravictim hisown
child,whom thePanua hadwished tomarry, A
party ofKhonds, whosaw this,immediately pressed
forward tocomfort the seller ofhis child, saying,
"Your child hasdied that alltheworld may live,and
theEarth Goddess herself willwipe that spittle from
your face."^The victims were often kept foryears
before theywere sacrificed. Being regarded ascon-
secrated beings, they were treated with extreme
affection, mingled with deference, andwere welcomed
wherever they went.AMeriah youth, onattaining
maturity, wasgenerally given awife,whowasherself
usually aMeriah orvictim;andwith herhereceived
aportion oflandandfarm-stock. Their offspring
were also victims. Human sacrifices were offered to
theEarth Goddess bytribes, branches oftribes, or
villages, both atperiodical festivals andonextra-
ordinary occasions. The periodical sacrifices were
generally soarranged bytribes anddivisions oftribes
thateach head ofafamily wasenabled, atleast once
ayear, toprocure ashred offlesh forhis fields,
generally about thetimewhen hischief crop was
laiddown.-
Themode ofperforming these tribal sacrifices
was asfollows. Ten ortwelve days before the
sacrifice, thevictim wasdevoted bycutting offhis
hair, which, until then, waskept unshorn. Crowds
ofmenandwomen assembled towitness the sacri-
fice;none might beexcluded, since the sacrifice
was declared tobe"for allmankind." Itwas
preceded byseveral days ofwild revelry andgross

debauchery.^ Onthedaybefore the sacrifice the
victim, dressed inanewgarment, was ledforth from
thevillage insolemn procession, withmusic anddanc-
ing, totheMeriah grove, which was aclump ofhigh
forest trees standing alittlewayfrom thevillage and
untouched bytheaxe. Inthisgrove thevictim was
tied toapost,which wassometimes placed between
two plants ofthesankissar shrub. Hewas then
anointed with oil,ghee, and turmeric, andadorned
with flowers;and"aspecies ofreverence, which it
isnoteasy todistinguish from adoration," waspaid
tohimthroughout the day.''Agreat struggle now
arose toobtain thesmallest relic from hisperson;
aparticle oftheturmeric paste withwhich hewas
smeared, oradrop ofhis spittle, wasesteemed
ofsovereign virtue, especially bythewomen. The
crowd danced round thepost tomusic, and,addressing
theearth, said,"OGod,weoffer this sacrifice toyou;
giveusgood crops, seasons, andhealth."^
Onthe lastmorning theorgies, which hadbeen
scarcely interrupted during thenight, were resumed,
andcontinued tillnoon, when they ceased, andthe
assembly proceeded toconsummate the sacrifice.
The victim wasagain anointed with oil,andeach
person touched theanointed part,andwiped the oil
onhisown head. Insome places thevictim was
thentaken inprocession round the village, from door

others begged foradrop ofhis spittle, withwhich
they anointed their heads.-^Asthevictim might

bones ofhisarms and, ifnecessary, hislegswere
broken;but often this precaution was rendered
unnecessary bystupefying him with opium. ^The
mode ofputting him todeath varied indifferent
places. One ofthecommonest modes seems to
have been strangulation, orsqueezing todeath.
Thebranch ofagreen treewas cleft several feet
down themiddle;thevictim's neck (inother places,
hischest) was inserted inthe cleft,which the priest,
aided byhisassistants, strove with allhisforce to
close.^ Then hewounded thevictim slightly with
hisaxe,whereupon thecrowd rushed atthevictim
and cutthe flesh from thebones, leaving thehead
andbowels untouched. Sometimes hewas cutup
alive.^ InChinna Kimedy hewasdragged along
the fields, surrounded bythecrowd, who, avoiding
hishead and intestines, hacked the flesh from his
body with their knives tillhedied.* Another very
common mode ofsacrifice inthesame district was
tofasten thevictim totheproboscis ofawooden
elephant, which revolved onastout post, and, as it
whirled round, thecrowd cutthefleshfrom thevictim
while liferemained. Insome villages Major Campbell
found asmany asfourteen ofthese wooden elephants,

lighted andhotbrands applied, tomake him rollup

The flesh cutfrom thevictim wasinstantly taken

Ineach village allwhostayed athome fasted rigidly

AMONG THEKHONDS 3S9
Theremains ofthehuman victim (namely, thehead,
bowels, andbones) were watched bystrong parties
thenight after thesacrifice;andnextmorning they
were burned, along with awhole sheep, onafuneral
pile. The ashes were scattered over the fields, laid
aspaste over thehouses andgranaries, ormixed with
thenewcorn topreserve itfrom insects.^ Sometimes,
however, theheadandbones were buried, notburnt.-
After thesuppression ofthehuman sacrifices, inferior
victims were substituted insome places; forinstance, in
thecapital ofChinna Kimedy agoat took theplace
ofahuman victim.^
IntheseKhond sacrifices theMerlahs arerepre-
sented byourauthorities asvictims offered topro-
pitiate theEarth Goddess. Butfrom thetreatment
ofthevictims both before andafter death itappears
that thecustom cannot beexplained asmerely a
propitiatory sacrifice. Apart ofthe flesh certainly
wasoffered totheEarth Goddess, buttherestofthe
fleshwasburied byeachhouseholder inhisfields, and
theashes oftheother parts ofthebody were scattered
over the fields, laidaspaste onthegranaries, ormixed
with thenew corn. These latter customs imply that
tothebody oftheMeriah there wasascribed adirect
orintrinsic power ofmaking thecrops togrow, quite
independent oftheindirect efficacy which itmight
have asanoffering tosecure thegood-will ofthedeity.
Inother words, thefleshandashes ofthevictim were
believed tobeendowed with aniagical orphysical
power offertilising theland. Thesame intrinsic power
wasascribed totheblood andtears oftheMeriah, his
blood causing theredness oftheturmeric and histears

390 HUMAN VICTIM
producing rain;for itcanhardly bedoubted that,
originally atleast, thetearsweresupposed toproduce
rain, notmerely toprognosticate it.Similarly the
custom ofpouring water ontheburied flesh ofthe
Meriah wasnodoubt arain-charm. Again, intrinsic
supernatural power asanattribute oftheMeriah
appears inthesovereign virtue believed toreside in
anything thatcame from hisperson, ashishair or
spittle. The ascription ofsuchpower totheMeriah
indicates thathewasmuch more thanamereman sac-
rificed topropitiate adeity. Once more, theextreme
reverence paidhim points tothesame conclusion.
Major Campbell speaks oftheMeriah as"being re-
garded assomething more than mortal,"^ andMajor
Macpherson says,"Aspecies ofreverence, which itis
noteasy todistinguish from adoration, ispaid tohim.""
Inshort, theMeriah appears tohave been regarded
asdivine. Assuch, hemay originally have represented
theEarth deity orperhaps adeity ofvegetation
;
though inlater times hecame toberegarded rather as
avictim offered toadeity than ashimself anincar-
nate deity. This later view oftheMeriah asa
victim rather than agodmayperhaps have received
undue emphasis from theEuropean writers whohave
described theKhond religion. Habituated tothelater
ideaofsacrifice asanoffering made toagod forthe
purpose ofconciliating hisfavour, European observers
areapttointerpret allreligious slaughter inthissense,
and tosuppose thatwherever such slaughter takes
place, there must necessarily beadeity towhom the
slaughter isbelieved bytheslayers tobeacceptable.
Thus their preconceived ideas unconsciously colour
andwarp their descriptions ofsavage rites.
1J.Campbell, p.112. -S.C.Macpherson, p.118.


Ill REPRESENTS THECORN-SPIRIT 391
Thesame custom ofkilling therepresentative ofa
god, ofwhich strong traces appear intheKhond
sacrifices, may perhaps bedetected insome ofthe
other human sacrifices described above. Thus the
ashes oftheslaughtered Marimo were scattered over
the fields ;theblood oftheBrahman ladwasput
onthecropand field;andtheblood oftheSioux
girlwasallowed totrickle ontheseed.^ Again, the
identification ofthevictim with the corn, inother
words, theview thatheisanembodiment orspirit of
thecorn, isbrought out inthepains which seem tobe
taken tosecure aphysical correspondence between him
andthenatural object which heembodies orrepresents.
Thus theMexicans killed young victims fortheyoung
cornandoldones fortheripecorn;theMarimos sacri-
fice, as"seed," ashort, fatman, theshortness ofhis
stature corresponding tothat oftheyoung corn, his
fatness tothecondition which itisdesired that the
crops may attain ;and thePawnees fattened their
victims probably with thesame view. Again, the
identification ofthevictim with thecorncomes out
intheAfrican custom ofkilling himwith spades and
hoes, andtheMexican custom ofgrinding him, like
corn,between twostones.
Onemore point inthese savage customs deserves
tobenoted. ThePawnee chief devoured theheart
oftheSioux girl,andtheMarimos andGonds atethe
victim's fiesh. If,aswesuppose, thevictim was re-
garded asdivine, itfollows that ineating hisflesh his
worshippers were partaking ofthebody oftheir god.
Tothispointweshall return later on.
The savage rites just described offer analogies
totheharvest customs ofEurope. Thus the fer-

tilising virtue ascribed tothecorn -spirit isshown
equally inthesavage custom ofmixing thevictim's
blood orashes with theseed-corn andtheEuropean
custom ofmixing thegrain from the lastsheaf with
theyoung corn inspring.^ Again, theidentification
oftheperson with thecorn appears alike inthe
savage custom ofadapting theageand stature of
thevictim totheageand stature (actual orexpected)
ofthecrop;intheScotch andStyrian rules thatwhen
thecorn-spirit isconceived astheMaiden thelastcorn
shallbecutbyayoung maiden, butwhen itisconceived
astheCorn-mother itshall becutbyanoldwoman;"
intheLothringian warning given tooldwomen tosave
themselves when theOldWoman isbeing killed, that
is,when thelastcorn isbeing threshed;^and inthe
Tyrolese expectation that ifthemanwhogives thelast
stroke atthreshing istall,thenext year's corn willbe
tallalso/ Further, thesame identification isimplied
inthesavage custom ofkilling therepresentative of
thecorn-spirit withhoes orspades orbygrinding him
between stones, and intheEuropean custom ofpre-
tending tokillhimwith thescythe orthe flail. Once
more theKhond custom ofpouring water ontheburied
flesh ofthevictim isparallel totheEuropean customs
ofpouring water onthepersonal representative ofthe
corn-spirit orplunging him intoastream.^ Both the
Khond andtheEuropean customs arerain-charms.
Toreturn now totheLityerses story. Ithasbeen
shown that inrude society human beings have been
commonly killed topromote thegrowth ofthecrops.
There istherefore noimprobability inthesupposition
thattheymayoncehavebeen killed foralikepurpose

inPhrygia andEurope ;andwhen Phrygian legend and
European folk-custom, closely agreeing witheach other,
point totheconclusion thatmenwere soslain,weare
bound, provisionally atleast, toaccept theconclusion.
Further, both the Lityerses story andEuropean
harvest customs agree inindicating that theperson
slainwas slain asarepresentative ofthecorn-spirit,
and this indication isinharmony with theviewwhich
savages appear totake ofthevictim slain tomake the
crops flourish. Onthewhole, then, wemay fairly
suppose thatboth inPhrygia and inEurope therepre-
sentative ofthecorn-spirit wasannually killed upon the
harvest-field. Grounds have been already shown for
believing that similarly inEurope therepresentative of
thetree-spirit wasannually slain. The proofs ofthese
tworemarkable and closely analogous customs are
entirely independent ofeach other. Their coincidence
seems tofurnish fresh presumption infavour ofboth.
Tothequestion, howwastherepresentative of
thecorn-spirit chosen ?oneanswer hasbeen already
given. Both theLityerses story andEuropean folk-
custom show that passing .strangers were regarded
asmanifestations ofthecorn -spirit escaping from
thecutorthreshed corn, and assuch were seized
and slain. But this isnottheonlyanswer which
theevidence suggests. According toone version
ofthePhrygian legend thevictims ofLityerses were
notpassing strangers butpersons whom hehad
vanquished inareaping contest ;andthough itisnot
saidthathekilled, butonly thathethrashed them,we
canhardly avoid supposing that inoneversion ofthe
story thevanquished reapers, likethestrangers inthe
other version, were said tohave been wrapt upby
Lityerses incorn-sheaves and sobeheaded. The


394 HUMAN VICTIM
supposition iscountenanced byEuropean harvest-
customs. Wehave seen that inEurope there issome-
times acontest amongst thereapers toavoid being last,
and that theperson who isvanquished inthiscom-
petition, that is,who cutsthelastcorn, isoften roughly
handled. Itistruewehave notfound thatapretence
ismade ofkilling him;butontheotherhandwehave
found thatapretence ismade ofkilling themanwho
gives thelaststroke atthreshing, that is,who isvan-
quished inthethreshing contest.^ Now, since itisin
thecharacter ofrepresentative ofthecorn-spirit that
thethresher ofthe lastcorn isslain inmimicry, and
since thesame representative character attaches (aswe
have seen) tothecutter andbinder aswell astothe
thresher ofthelastcorn,andsince thesame repugnance
isevinced byharvesters tobelast inanyoneofthese
labours, wemayconjecture that apretence hasbeen
commonly made ofkilling thereaper andbinder aswell
asthethresher ofthe last corn, and that inancient
times this killing wasactually carried out. This con-
jecture iscorroborated bythecommon superstition that
whoever cutsthelastcornmust diesoon.^ Sometimes
itisthought that theperson whobinds thelastsheaf
onthefield willdieinthecourse ofnext year.^ The
reason forfixing onthereaper, binder, orthresher of
thelastcorn astherepresentative ofthecorn-spirit may
bethis.The corn-spirit issupposed tolurk aslong
ashecaninthecorn, retreating before thereapers, the
binders, andthethreshers attheir work. Butwhen
heisforcibly expelled from hisultimate refuge inthe
lastcorn cutorthelastsheaf bound orthelastgrain
threshed, henecessarily assumes some other form than
1Above, p.374.2\v.Mannhardt, Kornddmoneii, p.5.
•*Pfannenschmid, Germanische Eriitefeste, p.98.


Ill REPRESENTS THECORN-SPIRIT 395
that ofthecorn-stalks which had hitherto been his
garments orbody. Andwhat form cantheexpehed
corn-spirit assume more naturally than thatoftheperson
who stands nearest tothecorn from which he(the
corn-spirit) hasjustbeen expelled ?Buttheperson in
question isnecessarily thereaper, binder, orthresher
ofthe lastcorn.Heorshe,therefore, isseized and
treated asthecorn-spirit himself.
Thus theperson whowas killed ontheharvest-
held astherepresentative ofthecorn-spirit mayhave
been either apassing stranger ortheharvester who
was last atreaping, binding, orthreshing. Butthere
isathird possibility, towhich ancient legend and
modern folk-custom alike point. Lityerses notonly
putstrangers todeath;hewas himself slain, and
probably inthesame way ashehad slain others,
namely, bybeing wrapt inacorn-sheaf, beheaded, and
cast intotheriver; and itisimplied that thishappened
toLityerses onhisown land. Similarly inmodern
harvest -customs thepretence ofkilling appears tobe
carried outquite asoften ontheperson ofthemaster
(farmer orsquire) asonthatofstrangers.^ Nowwhen
weremember thatLityerses wassaid tohavebeen the
sonoftheKing ofPhrygia, andcombine with thisthe
tradition thathewasput todeath, apparendy asa
representative ofthecorn -spirit, weareledtocon-
jecture thatwehave hereanother trace ofthecustom of
annually slaying oneofthose divine orpriestly kings
who areknown tohave held ghostly sway inmany
parts ofWestern Asia and particularly inPhrygia.
Thecustom appears, aswehave seen,^ tohave been
sofarmodified inplaces that the king's sonwas
slain inthe king's 'stead. Ofthecustom thus
1Above, p.376 sq.-Above, p.235.


396 ATTISANDLITYERSES chap.
modified thestory ofLityerses would therefore be
areminiscence.
Turning now tothe relation ofthePhrygian
Lityerses tothePhrygian Attis, itmayberemem-
bered that atPessinus— theseatofapriestly kingship—thehigh-priest appears tohavebeen annually slain
inthecharacter ofAttis, agodofvegetation, andthat
Attis wasdescribed byanancient authority as"a
reaped earofcorn."^ Thus Attis, asanembodiment
ofthecorn-spirit, annually slain intheperson ofhis
representative, might bethought tobeultimately
identical with Lityerses, the latter being simply the
rustic prototype outofwhich thestate religion ofAttis
wasdeveloped. Itmayhave been so; but,onthe
other hand, theanalogy ofEuropean folk-custom
warns usthatamongst thesame people two distinct
deities ofvegetation mayhave their separate personal
representatives, both ofwhom areslain inthecharacter
ofgods atdifferent times oftheyear. For inEurope,
aswehave seen, itappears thatonemanwascom-
monly slain inthecharacter ofthetree-spirit inspring,
andanother inthecharacter ofthe corn-spirit in
autumn. Itmayhavebeen soinPhrygia also. Attis
wasespecially atree-god, and hisconnection withcorn
mayhave been onlysuch anextension ofthepower
ofatree-spirit as isindicated incustoms like the
Harvest- May.'^Again, therepresentative ofAttis
appears tohave been slain inspring ;whereas
Lityerses musthavebeen slain insummer orautumn,
according tothetime oftheharvest inPhyrgia.^ On

and spread toItaly, the rites ofLityerses seem
never tohave passed the limits oftheir native
Phrygia, andalways retained their character ofrustic
ceremonies performed bypeasants ontheharvest-field.
Atmost afewvillages mayhave clubbed together, as
amongst theKhonds, toprocure ahuman victim to
beslain asrepresentative ofthecorn-spirit fortheir
common benefit. Such victims mayhavebeendrawn
from thefamilies ofpriestly kings orkinglets, which
would account forthelegendary character ofLityerses
asthesonofaPhrygian king.When villages did
notsoclub together, each village orfarmmayhave
procured itsown representative ofthecorn -spirit
bydooming todeath either apassing stranger orthe
harvester who cut,bound, orthreshed the last sheaf.
Itishardly necessary toadd that inPhrygia, asin
Europe, theoldbarbarous custom ofkilling amanon
theharvest-field orthethreshing-floor haddoubtless
passed intoamere pretence long before theclassical
era,andwasprobably regarded bythereapers and
threshers themselves asnomore than arough jest
which thelicense ofaharvest-home permitted them
toplay offonapassing stranger, acomrade, oreven
ontheir master himself.
Ihave dwelt ontheLityerses song atlength
because itafibrds somany points ofcomparison with

European andsavage folk-custom. Theother harvest
songs ofWestern AsiaandEgypt, towhich attention
hasbeen called above, ^maynowbedismissed much
more briefly. The similarity oftheBithynian Bormus-
tothePhrygian Lityerses helps tobear outtheinter-
pretation which hasbeen given ofthelatter. Bormus,
whose death orrather disappearance was annually
mourned bythereapers inaplaintive song, was, like
Lityerses, aking's sonoratleast thesonofawealth)'
anddistinguished man.Thereapers whom hewatched
were atwork onhisown fields, andhedisappeared in
going tofetch water forthem ;according toonever-
sion ofthestory hewas carried offbythe(water)
nymphs.=^Viewed inthelight oftheLityerses story
and ofEuropean folk-custom, thisdisappearance of
Bormus isprobably areminiscence ofthecustom of
binding thefarmer himself inacorn-sheaf andthrow-
inghim intothewater. Themournful strain which
thereapers sangwasprobably alamentation over the
death ofthecorn-spirit, slain either inthecutcorn or
intheperson ofahuman representative; andthe call
which theyaddressed tohimmayhavebeen aprayer
that thecorn -spirit might return infresh vigour next
year.
ThePhoenician Linus songwassung atthevintage,
atleast inthewest ofAsia Minor, aswelearn from
Homer;and this,combined with thelegend ofSyleus,
suggests that inancient times passing strangers were
handled byvintagers andvine-diggers inmuch the
sameway asthey aresaid tohave been handled by
thereaper Lityerses. TheLydian Syleus, soranthe
legend, compelled passers-by todig forhim inhis
vineyard, tillHercules came and killed himanddug

uphisvines bytheroots.^ This seems tobetheout-
Hneofalegend Hke that ofLityerses ;butneither
ancient writers normodern folk-custom enable usto
fillinthe details."- But, further, theLinus songwas
probably sung alsobyPhoenician reapers, forHero-
dotus compares ittotheManeros song, which, aswe
have seen,wasalament raised byEgyptian reapers
oyer thecutcorn. Further, Linus was identified with
Adonis, andAdonis hassome claims toberegarded
asespecially acorn-deity.^ Thus theLinus lament,
assung atharvest, would beidentical with theAdonis
lament ;each would bethelamentation raised by
reapers ov6r thedead corn -spirit. Butwhereas
Adonis, likeAttis, grew intoastately figure ofmytho-
logy,adored andmourned insplendid cities farbeyond
thelimits ofhisPhoenician home, Linus appears to
have remained asimple ditty sung byreapers and
vintagers among thecorn-sheaves andthevines. The
analogy ofLityerses andoffolk-custom, bothEuropean
andsavage, suggests that inPhoenicia theslain corn-
spirit—thedead Adonis—may formerly have been
represented byahuman victim;and thissuggestion
ispossibly supported bytheHarran legend that
Thammuz (Adonis) was slainbyhiscruel lord,who
ground hisbones inamilland scattered them tothe
wind.^ For inMexico, aswehave seen, thehuman
victim atharvest wascrushed between twostones;
andboth inIndia andAfrica theashes ofthevictim
were scattered over the fields.^ But theHarran
legend maybeonly amythical wayofexpressing the

grinding ofcorn inthemillandthescattering ofthe
seed. Itseems worth suggesting thatthemock king
whowasannually killed attheBabylonian festival of
theSacaea onthei6th ofthemonth Lousmayhave
represented Thammuz himself. For the historian
Berosus, who records thefestival and itsdate, prob-
ablyused theMacedonian calendar, since hededicated
hishistory toAntiochus Soter; and inhisdaythe
Macedonian month Lous appears tohavecorresponded
totheBabylonian month Thammuz.^ Ifthisconjec-
ture isright, theview that themock king atthe
Sacaea was slain inthecharacter ofagodwould be
established.
There isagood dealmore evidence that inEgypt
theslain corn-spirit—thedead Osiris—wasrepresented
byahuman victim, whom thereapers slew onthe
harvest-field, mourning hisdeath inadirge, towhich
theGreeks, through averbal misunderstanding, gave
thename ofManeros," Forthelegend ofBusiris
seems topreserve areminiscence ofhuman sacrifices
once offered bytheEgyptians inconnection with the
worship ofOsiris. Busiris was said tohave been an
Egyptian kingwho sacrificed allstrangers onthealtar
ofZeus. The origin ofthecustom wastraced toa

ficed toZeus. SoBusiris instituted thesacrifice. But
when Hercules came toEgypt, andwasbeing dragged
tothealtar tobesacrificed, heburst hisbonds and
slew Busiris and hisson.^ Here then isalegend
that inEgypt ahuman victim wasannually sacrificed
toprevent the failure ofthecrops, andabelief is
implied thatanomission ofthesacrifice would have
entailed arecurrence ofthat infertility which itwasthe
object ofthesacrifice toprevent. SothePawnees, as-
wehave seen, believed thatanomission ofthehuman
sacrifice atplanting would have been followed bya
total failure oftheir crops. Thename Busiris was

light oftheforegoing discussion, thisEgvptian tradi-
tionadmits ofaconsistent and fairly probable explan-
ation. Osiris, thecorn-spirit, wasannually represented
atharvest byastranger, whose redhairmade hima
suitable representative oftheripe corn. This man,
inhisrepresentative character, wasslainontheharvest-
field,andmourned bythereapers, whoprayed atthe

following year. Finally, thevictim, orsome part of

choice oftherepresentative ontheground ofhis

described/ Similarly theRomans sacrificed red-haired

thusgrow ripeandruddy;
"andtothisday insowing

scattering oftheEgyptian victim's ashes isidentical
with theMarimo andKhond custom.'^ His identi-

The story that thefragments ofOsiris's body were

reminiscence ofacustom, like thatobserved bythe
Khonds, ofdividing thehuman victim inpieces and
burying thepieces, often atintervals ofmany miles
from each other, inthe fields. However, itispossible
that thestory ofthedismemberment ofOsiris, like
thesimilar story told ofThammuz, mayhave been
simply amythical expression forthescattering ofthe
seed. Once more, thestory that thebody ofOsiris
enclosed inacoffer wasthrown byTyphon into the

Nileperhaps points toacustom ofthrowing thebody
ofthevictim, oratleast aportion of it,intotheNile
asarain-charm, orrather tomake theNile rise. For
asimilar purpose Phrygian reapers seem tohave
thrown theheadless bodies oftheir victims, wrapt in
corn-sheaves, into ariver, andtheKhonds poured
water ontheburied flesh ofthehuman victim. Prob-
ablywhen Osiris ceased toberepresented byahuman
victim, aneffigy ofhimwasannually thrown intothe
Nile, just asthe effigy ofhisSyrian counterpart,
Adonis, used tobethrown intotheseaatAlexandria.
Orwatermayhavebeen simply poured over it,ason
themonument already mentioned apriest isseen
pouring water over thebody ofOsiris, fromwhich corn
stalks aresprouting. Theaccompanying inscription,
"This isOsiris ofthemysteries, who springs from
thereturning waters," bears outtheview that atthe
mysteries ofOsiris awater-charm orirrigation-charm
was regularly performed bypouring water onhis
effigy, orbythrowing itintotheNile.

slain asrepresentatives notofOsiris, butofhisenemy

black, he isstillmorecommonly depicted asgreen,^

thegreen Demeter inspring withmirth andgladness.^
Thus, if Iamright, thekey tothemysteries of
Osiris isfurnished bythemelancholy cryofthe
Egyptian reapers, which down toRoman times could
beheard year after yearsounding across the fields,
announcing thedeath ofthecorn -spirit, the rustic
prototype ofOsiris. Similar cries, aswehave seen,
were alsoheard on alltheharvest-fields ofWest-
ernAsia. Bytheancients they arespoken ofas
songs;buttojudge from theanalysis ofthenames
Linus andManeros, theyprobably consisted only ofa
fewwords uttered inaprolonged musical notewhich
could beheard foragreat distance. Such sonorous
andlong-drawn cries, raised byanumber ofstrong
voices inconcert, must have had astriking effect,
andcould hardly failtoarrest theattention ofany
traveller whohappened tobewithin hearing. The
sounds, repeated again and again, could probably be
distinguished with tolerable easeeven atadistance;
buttoaGreek traveller inAsia orEgypt theforeign
words would commonly convey nomeaning, andhe
might takethem, notunnaturally, forthename ofsome
one(Maneros, Linos, Lityerses, Bormus), uponwhom
thereapers were calling. And ifhisjourney ledhim
through more countries than one, asBithynia and
Phrygia, orPhoenicia andEgypt, while thecornwas
being reaped, hewould haveanopportunity ofcom-
paring thevarious harvest criesofthedifferent peoples.
Thuswecanreadily account forthe factthat these
harvest crieswere sooften noted andcompared with
each other bytheGreeks. Whereas, iftheyhadbeen

regular songs, theycould nothavebeen heard atsuch
distances, andtherefore could nothave attracted the
attention ofsomany travellers;and,moreover, even
ifthetraveller were within hearing ofthem, hecould
notsoeasily have picked outthewords. Tothisday
Devonshire reapers utter cries ofthesame sort,and
perform onthe field aceremony exactly analogous
tothat inwhich, ifIamnotmistaken, the rites of
Osiris originated. Thecryandtheceremony arethus
described byanobserver whowrote inthe first half
ofthiscentury. "After thewheat isallcut,onmost
farms inthenorth ofDevon, theharvest people have
acustom of'crying theneck.' Ibelieve that thisprac-
tice isseldom omitted onany large farm inthat part
ofthecountry. Itisdone inthisway.Anoldman,
orsome oneelsewellacquainted with theceremonies

This iscalled 'theneck' ofwheat, orwheaten-ears.

holding them with both hands towards theground.
They then allbegin atonce inavery prolonged and
harmonious tone tocry'theneck!

They thenchange their cryto'weeyen!'—
'wayyen!'
—which theysound inthesame prolonged andslow
manner asbefore, with singular harmony and effect,
three times. This lastcry isaccompanied bythesame
movements ofthebody andarms asincrying'the
neck.' . . .After having thus repeated'theneck'
three times, and'wee yen,' or'way yen,' asoften,
they allburst outintoakind ofloudandjoyous laugh,
flinging uptheir hatsandcaps intothe air,capering
about andperhaps kissing the girls. One ofthem
then gets'theneck 'andruns ashard ashecandown
tothefarmhouse, where thedairymaid oroneofthe
young female domestics stands atthedoor prepared
with apailofwater. Ifhewhoholds 'theneck'can

openly, byanyotherwaythan thedoor atwhich the
girlstands with thepailofwater, thenhemay lawfully
kissher;but, ifotherwise, heisregularly soused with

evening, the'crying oftheneck'hasawonderful
effect atadistance, farfiner than thatoftheTurkish
muezzin, which Lord Byron eulogises somuch, and
which hesays ispreferable toallthebells inChristen-
dom. Ihaveonce ortwice heard upwards oftwenty
mencry it,andsometimes joined byanequal number
offemale voices. About three years back, onsome
high grounds, where ourpeople were harvesting, I
heard sixorseven'necks'cried inonenight, although
Iknow thatsome ofthem were fourmiles off.They
areheard through thequiet evening air,ataconsider-
able distance sometimes."^ Again, Mrs. Bray tells
how, travelling inDevonshire, "shesawaparty of

earsofcorn tiedtogether with flowers, andtheparty
shouted three times (what shewrites as)'Arnack,
arnack, arnack, wehaven, wehaven, wehaven.' They
went home, accompanied bywomen and children
carrying boughs offlowers, shouting andsinging. The
man-servant whoattended Mrs. Bray, said, 'itwasonly

thespirit ofharvest!"^Here, asMissBurne remarks,
"'arnack, wehaven!

generally hung upinthefarmhouse, where itsome-
times remains fortwo orthree years." Asimilar
custom isstillobserved insome parts ofCornwall, as I
aminformed bymyfriend ProfessorJ.H.Middleton.
"The lastsheaf isdecked with ribbons. Two strong-
voiced menarechosen andplaced (onewith thesheaf)
onopposite sides ofavalley. One shouts,'I've
gotten it.'The other shouts,'What hast gotten?'
The firstanswers,'I'segotten theneck.'"
Inthese Devonshire andCornish customs apar-
ticular bunch ofears, generally the last leftstanding,'
isconceived astheneck ofthecorn-spirit, who iscon-
sequently beheaded when thebunch iscutdown.
Similarly inShropshire thename "neck," or"the
gander's neck," used tobecommonly given tothelast
handful ofears leftstanding inthemiddle ofthe field,
when alltherestofthecornwas cut. Itwas plaited
together, and the reapers, standing tenortwenty
paces off,threw their sickles at it.Whoever cut it
through was said tohave cutoffthegander's neck.

manwho reaps the last standing corn "cuts the

wassometimes called the"head."^ AtAurich, in

The corn-spirit isconceived inhuman oranimal form,
