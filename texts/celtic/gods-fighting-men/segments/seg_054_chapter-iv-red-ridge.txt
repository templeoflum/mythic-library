CHAPTER IV. RED RIDGE


There was another young man came and served Finn for a while; out of
Connacht he came, and he was very daring, and the Red Ridge was the name
they gave him. And he all but went from Finn one time, because of his
wages that were too long in coming to him. And the three battalions of
the Fianna came trying to quiet him, but he would not stay for them. And
at the last Finn himself came, for it is a power he had, if he would
make but three verses he would quiet any one. And it is what he said:
"Daring Red Ridge," he said, "good in battle, if you go from me to-day
with your great name it is a good parting for us. But once at Rath Cro,"
he said, "I gave you three times fifty ounces in the one day; and at Cam
Ruidhe I gave you the full of my cup of silver and of yellow gold. And
do you remember," he said, "the time we were at Rath Ai, when we found
the two women, and when we ate the nuts, myself and yourself were there
together."

And after that the young man said no more about going from him.

And another helper came to Finn one time he was fighting at a ford, and
all his weapons were used or worn with the dint of the fight. And there
came to him a daughter of Mongan of the Sidhe, bringing him a flat stone
having a chain of gold to it. And he took the stone and did great deeds
with it. And after the fight the stone fell into the ford, that got the
name of Ath Liag Finn.

And that stone will never be found till the Woman of the Waves will find
it, and will bring it to land on a Sunday morning; and on that day seven
years the world will come to an end.
