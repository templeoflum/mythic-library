This is Lady Guests' translation of the Mabinogion.
 The Mabinogion is a cycle of Welsh legends collected in the
 Red Book of Hergest, a manuscript which is in the library
 of Oxford University.
 Mabinogion means 'tales of youth'; although this appellation only
 applies to a few of the stories, Lady Guest appropriated it as the
 title of this book, and
The Mabinogion
is now used as the name
 of the entire collection.
 The stories are based on historical characters and incidents
 from the dark ages in Wales and environs,
 embellished with supernatural and folklore elements.
 Throughout there are echoes of primordial Celtic
 mythology and folklore, including the ancient gods and goddesses.
The first five tales are Welsh versions of incidents from
 the Arthurian canon.
 The Mabinogion
per se
consists of
 the four connected narratives (called 'the branches')
 from Pwll, Prince of Dyved,
 through Math, the Son of Mathonwy.
 Following these are three additional stories,
 including the legend of one of the most famous
 bards of Wales, Taliesin.
The Mabinogion is one of the masterpieces of world literature,
 and a must-read for anyone who wants to have an
 understanding of Celtic lore.
One minor barrier for some readers may be the
 spelling of Welsh, particularly in place names and names of people.
 In a nutshell, 'w' and 'y' are vowels, pronounced like 'u' and 'i'
 respectively.
 Technically, double 'l' is voiceless; rest assured, 'Ll' at
 the start of a word is not a typo.
 So 'Pwyll', which on the face of it doesn't appear to have any vowels,
 can be thought of as being pronounced
approximately
like 'poo-eel'.
