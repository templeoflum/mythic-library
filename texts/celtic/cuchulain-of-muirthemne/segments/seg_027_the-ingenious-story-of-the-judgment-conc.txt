The ingenious story of the _Judgment concerning Cormac's Sword_ is
found in the BOOK OF BALLYMOTE, and is printed with a translation by
Dr Whitly Stokes in _IRISCHE TEXTE_, iii. Serie, 7 Heft, 1891.


Pronouncing Index


The correct pronunciation of Gaelic proper names can only be learned
from the living voice. It cannot be accurately represented by any
combination of letters from the English alphabet. I have spared the
reader as much trouble as possible on this score by simplifying, as
far as I could, the forms of the names occurring in the text, and if
the reader will note the following general rules, he will get quite as
near to the pronunciation intended as there is any necessity for him
to do. A few names which might present some unusual difficulty are
given with their approximate English pronunciations in the Index.

The chief rule to observe is that vowels are pronounced as in the
Continental languages, not according to the custom peculiar to
England. Thus _a_ is like _a_ in _father_, never like _a_ in _fate,
I_(when long) is like _ee_, _u_ like _oo_, or like _u_ in _put_ (never
like _u_ in _tune_). An accent implies length, thus _Dún_, a fortress
or mansion, is pronounced _Doon_. The letters _ch_ are never to be
pronounced with a _t_ sound, as in the word _chip_, but like a rough
_h_ or a softened _k_, rather as in German. _Gh_ is silent as in
English, and _g_ is always hard, as in _give_. _C_ is always as _k_,
never as _s_.

In the following Index an accent placed after a syllable indicates
that the stress is to be laid on that syllable. Only those words are
given, the pronunciation of which is not easily ascertainable by
attention to the foregoing rules.
