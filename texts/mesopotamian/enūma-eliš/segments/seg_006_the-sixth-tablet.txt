THE SIXTH TABLET
When Marduk heard the word of the gods,
His heart prompted him and he devised a cunning plan.
He opened his mouth and unto Ea he spake

That the service of the gods may be established, and that their shrines may be built.
But I will alter the ways of the gods, and I will change their paths;
Together shall they be oppressed and unto evil shall they....
And Ea answered him and spake the word:
"... the ... of the gods I have changed

... shall be destroyed and men will I...
... and the gods .
... and they..."

the last few lines of the tablet, which read as follows.]
They rejoiced...
In Upsukkinnaku they set their dwelling.
Of the heroic son, their avenger, they cried:
" We, whom he succored.... !"
They seated themselves and in the assembly they named him...,
They all cried aloud, they exalted him...
