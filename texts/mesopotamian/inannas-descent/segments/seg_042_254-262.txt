The
gala-tura
and the
kur-jara
paid attention to the instructions of
Enki
. They flitted through the door like flies. They
slipped through the door pivots like phantoms. The mother who gave birth,
Erec-ki-gala
, because of her children, was lying there. Her
holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth. Her breasts were not full
like a
cagan
vessel. Her nails were like a pickaxe (?) upon her. The
hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks.
