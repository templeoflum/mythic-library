entered the
E-kur

Enlil

Enlil
: "Father
Enlil
, don't let anyone kill your daughter in the

underworld. Don't let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the
mason's stone. Don't let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter's
wood. Don't let young lady
Inana
be killed in the
underworld."
