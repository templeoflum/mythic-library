Thus father
Nanna
did not help her in this matter, so she went to
Eridug
. In
Eridug
, when she had
entered the house of
Enki
, she lamented before
Enki
: "Father
Enki
, don't let anyone
kill your daughter in the underworld. Don't let your precious metal be alloyed
there with the dirt of the underworld. Don't let your precious lapis lazuli be
split there with the mason's stone. Don't let your boxwood be chopped up there
with the carpenter's wood. Don't let young lady
Inana
be killed in the underworld."
