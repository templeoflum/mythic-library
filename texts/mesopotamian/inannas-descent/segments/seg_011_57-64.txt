"And if
Nanna
does not help you in this matter, go to
Eridug
. In
Eridug
, when you have entered
the house of
Enki
, lament before
Enki
: "Father
Enki
, don't let anyone kill
your daughter in the underworld. Don't let your precious metal be alloyed there
with the dirt of the underworld. Don't let your precious lapis lazuli be split
there with the mason's stone. Don't let your boxwood be chopped up there with
the carpenter's wood. Don't let young lady
Inana
be
killed in the underworld."
