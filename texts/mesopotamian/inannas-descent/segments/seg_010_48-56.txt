"If
Enlil
does not help you in this matter, go to
Urim
. In the
E-mud-kura
at
Urim
, when you have entered the
E-kic-nu-jal
, the house of
Nanna
, lament
before
Nanna
: "Father
Nanna
,
don't let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. Don't let your precious
metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. Don't let your precious
lapis lazuli be split there with the mason's stone. Don't let your boxwood be
chopped up there with the carpenter's wood. Don't let young lady
Inana
be killed in the underworld."
