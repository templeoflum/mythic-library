Erec-ki-gala
said to the
gala-tura
and the
kur-jara
:
"Bring your queen ......, your ...... has been seized."
Inana
, because of
Enki's
instructions, was
about to ascend from the underworld. But as
Inana
was
about to ascend from the underworld, the
Anuna
seized
her: "Who has ever ascended from the underworld, has ascended unscathed from
the underworld? If
Inana
is to ascend from the
underworld, let her provide a substitute for herself."
