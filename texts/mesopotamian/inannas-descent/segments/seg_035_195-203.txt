Thus father
Enlil
did not help in this matter, so she went to
Urim
. In the
E-mud-kura
at
Urim
, when she had entered the
E-kic-nu-jal
, the house of
Nanna
, she
lamented before
Nanna
: "Father
Nanna
, don't let your daughter be killed in the underworld. Don't
let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. Don't
let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason's stone. Don't let
your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter's wood. Don't let young
lady
Inana
be killed in the underworld."
